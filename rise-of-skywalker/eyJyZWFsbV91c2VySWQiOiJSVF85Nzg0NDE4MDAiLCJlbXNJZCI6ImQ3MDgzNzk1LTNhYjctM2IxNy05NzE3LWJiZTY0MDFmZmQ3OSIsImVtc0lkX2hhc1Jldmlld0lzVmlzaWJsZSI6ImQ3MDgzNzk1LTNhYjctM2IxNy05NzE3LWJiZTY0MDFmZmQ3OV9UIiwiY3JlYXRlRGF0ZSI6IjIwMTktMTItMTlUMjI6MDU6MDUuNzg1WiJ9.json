While it is dense and very fast paced, it jumps from beat to beat in an adrenaline pumping way that feels frantic but natural. Hurried, but necessary. The film is a love letter to the franchise, as well as an apology to the fan base for the missteps of the last Jedi. If you are a casual fan, or a devotee of the Star Wars phenomena, you will love it. If you are a fan of the Last Jedi... prepare to have your expectations subverted.","displayName":"Chris H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/562706727607777/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:03:35.096Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:03:57.305Z","user":{"userId":"978441791","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris H","accountLink":"/user/id/978441791"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"There was no point to this trilogy. The planet killing guns are getting out of control. It is really hard to blame JJ as well because there was really no where to go after TLJ.
