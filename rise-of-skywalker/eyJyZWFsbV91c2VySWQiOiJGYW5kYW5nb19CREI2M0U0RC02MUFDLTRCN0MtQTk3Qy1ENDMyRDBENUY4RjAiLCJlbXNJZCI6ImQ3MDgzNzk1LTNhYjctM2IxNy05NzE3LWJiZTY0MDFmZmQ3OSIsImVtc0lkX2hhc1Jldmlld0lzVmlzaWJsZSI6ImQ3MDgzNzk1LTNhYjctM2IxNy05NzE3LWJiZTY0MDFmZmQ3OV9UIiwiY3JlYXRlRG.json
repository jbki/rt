The movie undermines it self at every turn. The plot is idiotic and predictable, the final order is even dumber then the first. The bad guys main plan appears to be entirely superfluous to his goals. The attempts at shock and suspense are laughably predicable and undermined. A half dozen characters are stuffed in just to serve as 10 second plot device or as a illusion of character development.  If you like starwars just watch the Mandalorian.","displayName":"Mike T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T23:14:00.906Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T23:14:00.906Z","user":{"userId":"978485083","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike T","accountLink":"/user/id/978485083"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good movie... should have been 30 minutes longer .... best of the new trilogy .","displayName":"James W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T23:13:51.385Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T23:13:51.385Z","user":{"userId":"6D011756-83DF-4877-B7C0-86FA4B10B2D1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"James W","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Weak ending to a weak series of poorly written movies.
