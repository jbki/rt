Lots of great visuals, sound was amazing. Music always good. Considering the Last Jedi went a little on the comedy/goofy side. This one corrected that, felt more like Star Wars.

The cast of other characters new and old was good also.","displayName":"Facebook U","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T01:58:03.352Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T01:58:03.352Z","user":{"userId":"c9ddaac3-0866-4d1a-938e-b8681cf3429c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Facebook U","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"The movie was ok, but I feel the genre is changing for the audience.
