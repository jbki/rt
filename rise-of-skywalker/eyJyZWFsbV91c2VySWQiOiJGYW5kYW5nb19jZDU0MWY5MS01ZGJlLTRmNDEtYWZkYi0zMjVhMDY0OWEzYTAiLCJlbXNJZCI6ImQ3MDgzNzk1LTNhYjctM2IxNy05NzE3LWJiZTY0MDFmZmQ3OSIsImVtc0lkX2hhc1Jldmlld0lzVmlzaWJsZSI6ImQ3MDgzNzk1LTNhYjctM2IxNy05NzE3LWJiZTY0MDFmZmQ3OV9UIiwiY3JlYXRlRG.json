No character development.  Tried to do way too much.  Confusing plot holes.  Unneeded characters introduced.  Too many \"fake deaths\".  Don't be afraid to kill off characters... just give them honorable endings.  Just messy.\n\nPros: Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley shined.  Their story arc of courage, honor, redemption, and sacrifice was well played.  So much so that for me it tipped the scales.  Without this... this movie would've been really bad.","displayName":"D.Gaddy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T14:23:23.918Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T14:23:23.918Z","user":{"userId":"4ccbc1a6-10f6-4e59-ba3c-c64584acd1a5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"D.Gaddy","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"An uninspired dreadful movie with lacklustre  directional flair, sets and characters; filled to the max (and then some) in conveniences and poorly executed reveals which leads you to wonder where Star Wars went wrong","displayName":"Luke D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T14:23:19.172Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T14:27:26.648Z","user":{"userId":"977707094","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luke D","accountLink":"/user/id/977707094"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good way to end the saga.
