Seemingly no creative vision, no driving thread, only loosely sewn together ideas that disappointingly culminate in a \"this is the most Star Wars, right?\" kinda way.\n\nSomeone must've thought that there wasn't enough nostalgia in the sequel trilogy so they just dumped everything \"Star Wars\" they could think of into this movie. The plot is just convoluted, a big hunt for a MacGuffin to find the big bad that apparently concentrates everything evil there is, fitting content to fill 3 movies into one. The story beats from previous movies is barely recognized at all, it's more like the creators just realized it's only one film left and they had plans for a whole trilogy.\nOn the plus side, the movie is visually stunning, and music as well as sound design are sublime. \n\nNothing about its execution appears bold or innovative, on the contrary the most interesting results from the previous movie are ridiculed or retconned. And the moments where it emotionally connected are cheapened by too convenient resolutions. Instead of a strong conclusion to the saga we get a nostalgia-driven firework of fanservice. It's a lot, but it isn't much.","displayName":"Rafael D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10207915465443412/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:18:29.282Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:18:35.803Z","user":{"userId":"976948853","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rafael D","accountLink":"/user/id/976948853"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Despite some pacing issues and the occasional bits of clunky dialogue, this movie is an amazing ride. It's packed to the brim and a worthy conclusion to the sequel trilogy - although I wouldn't say it felt like the end of the entire saga.
