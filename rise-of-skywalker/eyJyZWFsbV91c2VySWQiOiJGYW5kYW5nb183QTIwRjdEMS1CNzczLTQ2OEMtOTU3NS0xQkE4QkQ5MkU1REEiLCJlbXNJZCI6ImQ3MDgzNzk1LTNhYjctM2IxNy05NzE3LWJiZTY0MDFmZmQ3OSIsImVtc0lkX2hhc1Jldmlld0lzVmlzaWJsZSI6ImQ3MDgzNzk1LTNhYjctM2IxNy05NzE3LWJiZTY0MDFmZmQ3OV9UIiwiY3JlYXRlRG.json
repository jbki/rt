I went into the movie with low expectations based on the reviews and the disappointment from TLJ. It was wildly entertaining........ Non stop action from beginning to end....... Many moments where your just watching with your jaw on the floor. I only wish JJ did all 3.

It's not a perfect movie.  The pacing in the beginning is rushed, there are dialog problems (aren't there always in Star Wars films?), and there were plot points that were more convenient than great story telling but all that aside, the film is an amazing space opera romp through a universe that we've known and loved for decades.  Highly recommended.","displayName":"Shane P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:12:08.581Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:12:10.522Z","user":{"userId":"978466619","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shane P","accountLink":"/user/id/978466619"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing end to an Era!","displayName":"Heather","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:12:07.329Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:12:07.329Z","user":{"userId":"A49F5244-B600-4DD3-A078-569784FA6FF7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Heather","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great swan song finale to this story.","displayName":"Theodore A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:11:57.129Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:11:57.129Z","user":{"userId":"BFA0E93A-E766-47CC-B1E2-0C251D74D7BE","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Theodore A","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"An alright ending the the last trilogy, but less so for the saga.","displayName":"reid m","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:10:59.535Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:11:01.369Z","user":{"userId":"d56fbc78-d9be-48ad-a58e-cb119db5ba63","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"reid m","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A fitting end to one of the most prolific and captivating sagas in cinematic history.
