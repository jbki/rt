To those who liked it, I feel obligated to say I'm glad you did. I wish I shared the feeling. But I can't. Abrams had nothing to work with after the Last Jedi, and he did nothing whatsoever to dig the franchise out of Rian Johnson's hole. Horrible plot contrivance and conveniences. One dimensional characters. But hey, it looked pretty.
