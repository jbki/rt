Iâ€™ve seen the entire prequel trilogy since Phantom Menace first came out and by far this trilogy is WAY better.  Nothing can compete with the Original Trilogy, but Iâ€™m not reviewing to hate on the prequels too or knit pick on this movieâ€™s choices. My feelings toward the entire new Trilogy is more positive, because of itâ€™s originality. Enough of that Mary Sue crap because Rey proves she is both an inspiring character and human. I wonâ€™t spoil anything that the trailers probably did already but for those who really watched the movie youâ€™ll understand how much effort was put into the story and special effects, without worrying about how it picks up after Last Jedi, or worrying what you thought was going to happen. What happens today is that most people anticipate way too much making theyâ€™re own story in their minds. And if itâ€™s not on screen then they get upset easily. Just like Dark Knight Rises after The Dark Knight wowed, you canâ€™t have over expectations but faith in your feelings watching this. I loved it and personally think the cast were a blast!","displayName":"Daniel  C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-31T23:59:00.947Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T23:59:00.947Z","user":{"userId":"6AD39572-0763-43B3-A58A-C8C340C7AB6A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Daniel  C","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Fun not perfect movie.

The story was kind of confusing to me and had to many turning points in my opinion.\nThe good: awesome CG, Kylo Ren, Han Solo,  Lando Calrissian, the emperor\nThe bad: bad character development for Rey, plot/story gaps or mistakes which makes you wonder (why shoot the troopers in the hangar when you use mind control a moment later?), recycled battles\n\nOverall a movie that was ok but could have been so much more. One could argue that they butchered the saga with this conclusion.","displayName":"Stefan D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T23:56:23.437Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T23:56:23.437Z","user":{"userId":"978495155","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stefan D","accountLink":"/user/id/978495155"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Great to see a Star Wars movie.
