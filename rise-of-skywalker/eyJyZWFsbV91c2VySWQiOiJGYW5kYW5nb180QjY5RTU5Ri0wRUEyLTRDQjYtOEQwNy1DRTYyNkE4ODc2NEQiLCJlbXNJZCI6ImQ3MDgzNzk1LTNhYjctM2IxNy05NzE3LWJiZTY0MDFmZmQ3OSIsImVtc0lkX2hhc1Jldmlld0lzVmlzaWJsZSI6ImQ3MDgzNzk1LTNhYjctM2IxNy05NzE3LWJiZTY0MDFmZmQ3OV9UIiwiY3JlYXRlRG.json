It's a knee jerk reaction to The Last Jedi. There are two movies in here and they're both fighting to tell a story vastly different than The Last Jedi. It's disappointing.

The best of Episodes 7, 8, and  9.  It had everything to make a Star War nerd, like me,  ecstatic!  I can't wait to see it again (today!!).  We thought it was as good as the original,  Episodes 4, 5 and 6.  I laughed,I  cried happy tears, and in between I was on the edge of my seat.  The only negative is how they portrayed Palpatin.  Having him hooked up to that ... well to that whatever it was ... was the only time I had to stretch my imagination.  This is still a 5-star movie.  How can it not be with a cameo by the Ewoks!  Go enjoy this movie...don't go with the mindset to pick it apart.  Sit back and enjoy the ride!  Remember, the force will be with you...always.","displayName":"Sarah K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T15:13:08.404Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T15:13:08.404Z","user":{"userId":"591a5667-b55d-4536-9996-aa996f8b0408","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sarah K","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Story line was confused and confusing.
