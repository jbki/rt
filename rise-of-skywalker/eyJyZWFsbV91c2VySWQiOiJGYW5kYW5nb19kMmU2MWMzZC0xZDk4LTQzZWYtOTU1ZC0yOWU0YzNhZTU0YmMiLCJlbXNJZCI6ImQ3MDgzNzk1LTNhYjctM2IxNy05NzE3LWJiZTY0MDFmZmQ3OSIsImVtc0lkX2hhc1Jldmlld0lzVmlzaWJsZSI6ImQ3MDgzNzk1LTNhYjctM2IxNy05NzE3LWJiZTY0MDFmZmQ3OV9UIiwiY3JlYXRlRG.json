Nothing to hate about it if you have no investment in seeing the story turn out a certain way. I loved the Last Jedi in how it changed the narraritive of the Jedi and Sith and more importantly how our protaganists Rey and Ben played into it. The Rise of Skywalker was a rehashing of just olllllllldddddddd assssssss ideas and storylines and an ill fitting end to a 10.........10 MOVIE SAGA.
