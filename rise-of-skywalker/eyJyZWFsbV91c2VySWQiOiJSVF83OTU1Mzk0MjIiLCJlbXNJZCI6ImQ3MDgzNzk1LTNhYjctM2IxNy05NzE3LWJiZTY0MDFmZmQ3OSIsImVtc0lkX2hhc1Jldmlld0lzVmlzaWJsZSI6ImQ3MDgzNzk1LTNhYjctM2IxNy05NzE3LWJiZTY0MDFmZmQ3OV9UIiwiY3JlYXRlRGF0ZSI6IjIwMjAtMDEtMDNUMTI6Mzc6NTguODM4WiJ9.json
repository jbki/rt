Gaps:\n- stupid plot\n- clip storytelling\n- poor characters\n- exploitation of favorite things from 1-6 episodes\n- creative impotence\n- skype force (are you kidding me??). In this case Palpatine can kill everyone in the galaxy staying home in every episode\n- incompetent J. J.

I'll have to say it was better than expected (Disney set a very low bar).  There was an attempt to tell a story and not just preach wokeness to us however, the characters were still 1D and dialog was predictable and tiring. the visuals were great as usual.","displayName":"Ivan, the Russian Bot","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T12:26:53.426Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T12:26:53.426Z","user":{"userId":"49C5C034-89F9-4972-AADF-5851BF6D430C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ivan, the Russian Bot","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"16h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Liked the movie , could have been better written but loved all the answers we got to the years old questions .
