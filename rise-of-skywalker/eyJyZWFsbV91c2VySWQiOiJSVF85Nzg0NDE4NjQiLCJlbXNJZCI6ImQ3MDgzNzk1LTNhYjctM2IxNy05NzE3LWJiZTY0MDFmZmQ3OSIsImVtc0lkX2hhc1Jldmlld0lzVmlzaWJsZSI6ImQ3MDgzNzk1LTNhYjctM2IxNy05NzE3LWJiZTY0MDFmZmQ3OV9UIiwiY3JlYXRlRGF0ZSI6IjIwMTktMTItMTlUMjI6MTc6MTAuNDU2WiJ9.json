It wasn't even in between, it was just out there somewhere, trying to find itself. The writing decisions and plot was atrocious, definitely one of the worst movies to come out this year. This was an absolute disaster that made everything that happened in every one of the previous movie become meaningless. It's so ridiculous how it completely destroys every single thing that has happened in the series, an utter disaster that blows both new and old fans away. This movie should be more than enough proof of how bad Kathleen Kennedy has been for the franchise, if somehow her comments on the lack of source material did not show you that already.","displayName":"Michael L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:17:04.310Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:17:07.415Z","user":{"userId":"978441803","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael L","accountLink":"/user/id/978441803"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"A great visual show but a movie mess.

It has good action, fun new characters and some good nostalgic call backs to the original trilogy. But when leaving the cinema, I was left with a ton of unanswered questions and few plot points that should have needed explanation. I also found it slow-paced at some times and we kind of drifted away from the main objective at some locations...\nOverall it is a satisfying conclusion to the epic skywalker saga but sadly, not as good as I would have expected.","displayName":"Grgoire  V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:14:07.522Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:14:12.553Z","user":{"userId":"977802083","realm":"RT","displayName":"Grgoire  V","accountLink":"/user/id/977802083"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"I had low expectations and was ready to forgive a lot of cringy, cheesy and illogical moments just for the sake of the franchise. But damn this was terrible.\nIt's like they started with an underwhelming plot, but then the editors took over and made every good moment there was in it fail to deliver the intended emotion. Instead of telling the story they focused on the main characters repeating the same vague sayings about faith and friendship over and over. \nI wish this never existed, so that we could get a different ending to the saga.","displayName":" ","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1402760466567737/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:14:06.798Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:14:11.262Z","user":{"userId":"978441841","realm":"RT","displayName":" ","accountLink":"/user/id/978441841"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It really does wrap up the \"saga\" and brings the sequel trilogy to a satisfying conclusion","displayName":"Josh L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10153729835902776/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:13:39.294Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:13:50.575Z","user":{"userId":"974550671","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josh L","accountLink":"/user/id/974550671"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing visuals as usual As well as the appearance of mythic characters.
