A lot of the \"fixes\" are alright and actually what the fans wanted but its executed in such a way that the viewer is constantly saying: \"Umm... okay\" and \"how?\"\nIn the midst of trying to repair the damage the last movie caused to the plot and also to continue a new series of story arcs, the movie often explains away things by \"this happens just because we say so.\" To top it off it gets so fanservice-y that it's obvious what they are doing, so many \"heartfelt\" moments but actually weren't because the movie takes away from the moments with events that happen later/earlier in it's own film. Not to mention a lot of the gripes that people had with TLJ were answered in this one but with varying levels of success, most of them being added just to be there to satisfy critics.","displayName":"Tristan H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T21:09:38.032Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T21:09:49.212Z","user":{"userId":"978387074","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tristan H","accountLink":"/user/id/978387074"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Still parsing my feelings on some of the larger plot arcs - I loved when Ray's parents were 'nobody' - a sentiment that empowers the viewers and fans. More importantly, the movie had no breathing room and therefore played like an Avengers movie, not a Star Wars movie. The final movie of the Skywalker saga should have been filled with deep emotional impact, but because Abrams yanked us around so much, there was no time to process any of the bombshell plot developments. Sadly, I felt this was John Williams' most forgettable Star Wars score, which felt like nothing more than fan service when it wasn't trying to keep up with the chaotic pace. This was a movie for Star Wars populists, and had nothing visionary to offer.","displayName":"Ben W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T21:09:20.754Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T21:09:20.754Z","user":{"userId":"978471495","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ben W","accountLink":"/user/id/978471495"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Exciting close to the Skywalker saga.
