Reason being there's some unanswered questions that are presented in the movie, but many things, while looking like fan service, are fixed from the previous movie. I would also say that it kept the tradition of Star Wars trilogies as in the 1st and 3rd are the best and the 2nd is slow and just trying to advance the story to the eventual finale.","displayName":"Brett","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T06:16:41.653Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T06:16:41.653Z","user":{"userId":"178837BA-F438-4BAB-822C-60DDFCF8AF03","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Brett","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"J.J.
