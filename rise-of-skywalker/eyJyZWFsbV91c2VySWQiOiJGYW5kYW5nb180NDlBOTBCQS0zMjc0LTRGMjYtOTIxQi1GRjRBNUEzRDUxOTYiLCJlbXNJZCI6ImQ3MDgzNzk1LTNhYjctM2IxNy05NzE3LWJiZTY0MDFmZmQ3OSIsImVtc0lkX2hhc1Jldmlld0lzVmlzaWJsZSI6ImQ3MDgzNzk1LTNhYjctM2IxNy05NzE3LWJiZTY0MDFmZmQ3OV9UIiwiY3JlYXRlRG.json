Palpatine wasnt the best villain the first time. Why bring him back?! Its like they had no real storyline plan and was winging it the whole time. The film consisted of soo much talking to explain decisions and undo TLJ mistakes. Even the title ‘TRoS' felt like a complete con to get butts in seats at the cinema, and was a shambles that it was reflecting Rey's connection to the Skywalkers, and not any real storyline. Too many flash backs and nostalgia, and not enough meaningful content. BLAAA. It makes me angry that they didnt consult panels of true Star Wars fans to plan the trilogy before setting out the plot. True fans would not have allowed this to happen.","displayName":"Chloe B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:48:35.521Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:48:35.521Z","user":{"userId":"978466239","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chloe B","accountLink":"/user/id/978466239"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"}]}
