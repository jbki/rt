It's simply outrageous how Disney managed to completely destroy an entire Star Wars trilogy and call it \"the end of the saga\". The issues with this movie are so vast that I would need to write pages and pages of utter disgust. As a matter of fact, Disney should just give up on trying to make new Star Wars material and just canonize and use some stuff from Legends like the Yuzhan Vong Wars, Abeloth etc\nIn other words, use material made by those who understand Star Wars better than you ever will and capitalize on it.","displayName":"Leonardo F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1375071096008599/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:51:13.353Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:51:20.477Z","user":{"userId":"978483714","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leonardo F","accountLink":"/user/id/978483714"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"There was nothing to dislike the movie was fantastic","displayName":"robyari02 L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:50:59.026Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:50:59.026Z","user":{"userId":"A0F8B2B5-4783-490C-957B-EC4E9B3EB5FF","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"robyari02 L","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved the hole movie wish they would not stop making them","displayName":"William","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:50:14.607Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:50:14.607Z","user":{"userId":"edb99e77-85aa-47dc-857a-e0bcbe057669","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"William","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Beginning is good, end is ok. The trek to get there is confusing as can be. A few good moments, some almost great. As always, Palpy steals the show-even though he’s in for no more than 10 minutes. You could tell that with Leia dead, they struggled. Kept dragging with that-felt more like Weekend at Morty’s that flick with the dead body being dragged around the Hamptons. Very sad & poorly done. Unlike many others, for once Rey DID earn her stripes but in fits & bouts, like everything else these days. I actually felt bad for her. The last Skywalker himself not who you think surprised & delighted. However even that, felt disjointed. 9/10 scenes raced to the end until they were shoved off the directorial chopping block. A lot of thought was put in—until it wasn’t. Disappointing only because the speed & fan service can’t make up for all that. That sentence right beforehand is a good example. Overall, fun, but a lot glaring issues to actively overlook while enjoying. Good job, JJ-you tried very hard & it worked. Just please go back through after & watch the whole thing through.               As an aside, irony has no bounds it seems, because I had a dream about JJ Abrams, with him making something for a “proto-network” whatever that means. Maybe CBS? He was stressed & tried to tank the whole project. Hope he’s ok. We shall see.","displayName":"Alex S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:50:08.599Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:50:08.599Z","user":{"userId":"EF4DCB0A-FFA5-4DD1-9C5C-56B5994705E6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Alex S","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Of course you need to suspend logic when watching these type of movies, but this one hit a new unbelievable level.","displayName":"Albert B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:49:40.004Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:49:40.004Z","user":{"userId":"88d8d9dc-d181-441f-9302-e807eb76cf05","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Albert B","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Some continuity errors but otherwise a nice wrap up to a great story.","displayName":"Sheri","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:49:26.502Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:49:26.502Z","user":{"userId":"7fd314eb-aaf2-42a6-8716-6ffe1ef394f7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sheri","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Star Wars: The Rise  Of Skywalker is good.
