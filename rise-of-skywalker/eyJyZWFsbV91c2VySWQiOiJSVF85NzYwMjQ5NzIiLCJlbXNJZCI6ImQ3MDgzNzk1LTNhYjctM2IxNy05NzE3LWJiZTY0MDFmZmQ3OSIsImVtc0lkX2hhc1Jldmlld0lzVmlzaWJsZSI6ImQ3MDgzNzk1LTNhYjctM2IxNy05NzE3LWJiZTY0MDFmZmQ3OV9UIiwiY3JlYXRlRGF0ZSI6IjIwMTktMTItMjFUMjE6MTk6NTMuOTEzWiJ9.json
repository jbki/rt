Just saw the Rise of Skywalker. And before I begin I'm going to give it my score:\nüëçüèøüëçüèøüëçüèøüëçüèøüëçüèøüëçüèøüëçüèøüëéüèøüëéüèøüëéüèø I \"liked\" it... I think it was \"entertaining\"... But yeah. I can see why some people will have issues with it. I'm mean the fan service in this film is so big in this film that you might as well redid the whole original trilogy. Lol\n\nNow, I'm one of the people that REALLY like The Last Jedi, only because it was different. I felt that the Force Awaken was a rehash of a New Hope, which the Phantom Menace was. And Rise Of Skywalker was no different, but it had back to back, to back... and to back action. Which some people would like.\n\nAlso apparently in this film logic went out the movie. There were moments even I said \"oh.. ok... so this what we're doing now. Ok... If you say so\". Though that opening scroll made want to see that movie it was describing though.\n\nThis movie is also DEFINITELY a \"Fuck You\" to The Last Jedi. Lol. I mean they took a lot from that film and just retconned (changed up) what was now established. There were some good reconns that actually work well in the overall 9 series regarding the Sith, but some that had me scratch my head a couple of time.\n\nThis isn't a spoiler because it's been in every trailer, but The Emporer/Darth Sidious/Chancellor Palpatine is back. And yeah.... I can tell they just added him in as an after thought. Matter critics were right... All three films felt like they made it up as they went along. There wasn't an over-arching story to be told and this is a part of George Lucas that Disney is missing. Say what you will about the Prequels, they at least had a great story to them.\n\nIn the end though, I think this film was fun, adventurous and visually spectacular, but there were a lot of bad scenes, scenarios, and plot to make me just \"like\" it.\n\nIf you like the Force Awakens, you love this. If you like the Last Jedi, you'll hate this. If you both previous films, you'll like this. If you're a star wars purist, you hate this. If you just want to watch a good movie and get entertained, you like this. If you care about logic and what has been established before this, you'll hate it.\n\nOverall, I like to think the casual moviegoers will have a good time without the details.","displayName":"Mak C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:19:16.003Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:19:18.588Z","user":{"userId":"966970730","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mak C","accountLink":"/user/id/966970730"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Entertaining and action packed\nNot best Star Wars but did not disappoint","displayName":"maryharrington","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:19:13.035Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:19:13.035Z","user":{"userId":"2d443812-f64a-4643-9cbc-a4ce9059f558","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"maryharrington","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It's an emotional ride and this movie understands the characters.
