Too much exposition + thin plot + a bunch of spectacle and a whole lot of pew-pew = a hollow film with no soul. I didn't care for it. In short, he bottled it.

It is, however, very interesting...\n\nNever has a chapter of the Saga been so heavily influenced by the previous one, in so many ways, and on so many levels.\n\nIt is impossible to correctly speak of, or criticize this film, without talking about the one that it followed. Every aspect of this film, from the pacing & editing, to the script & main plot is a reaction to The Last Jedi, directly or indirectly. \n\n...and when I say \"reaction\", I am being subtle. In some places, I would go so far to say that The Rise of Skywalker gives the middle finger to The Last Jedi.\n\nIf you are happy to hear that (as admittedly I also would be), don't rejoice just yet. The Rise of Skywalker suffers alot from having to retcon several mistakes, plot holes, and storytelling problems created by the previous movie. \n\nJ.J. Abrams did what he could to right the wrongs of The Last Jedi. And while it is definitely appreciated by some of us, there was insufficient time & space left to unfold the final chapter of the trilogy -let alone the entire saga- properly.\n\nThe result is a break-neck pace, crammed full of exposition, action, locations, and emotions, with absolutely no space to breath. Nothing that happens is allowed to settle, rest, or be processed by the characters nor the audience...thus losing much if its impact, gravitas, and ultimately, importance.\n\nMany things in the film are done correctly, such as main character development & chemistry, respect of the StarWars lore & legacy, StarWars locations, language, humor & feel. However most of these things belong in the previous chapter, so as to serve as Set-up for this final chapter. So all these elements, although appreciated, feel severely rushed and crowbarred into this movie. It is strange that this movie isn't at least lengthier, as it could greatly benefit from 30 more minutes of runtime.\n\nThe film will certainly be divisive, as it heavily depends on the viewer's point of view (#Obi Wan). Many, who disliked The Last Jedi will approve of what this movie is trying to do, but I think must admit that retconing also creates its own problems. Others who enjoyed The Last Jedi, will almost certainly seriously dislike this movie, although they should admit that J.J. Abrams was painted into a dark corner due to the...lets say \"unorthodox\" choices made by Rian Johnson in the previous movie.\n\nShould J.J. Abrams have built on and expanded the almost non-StarWars world that Rian Johnson left for him? Could he? Or was he right to backpedal and try to retrofix The Last Jedi's hubris? That's a debate that will probably never end...\n\nWhat we Can all agree on, hopefully, is that it was a huge mistake by Lucasfilm not to have planned and agreed on a unifying vision for the trilogy beforehand.","displayName":"Norman K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10155490564758744/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T19:52:08.311Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T00:32:22.359Z","user":{"userId":"976976393","realm":"RT","displayName":"Norman K","accountLink":"/user/id/976976393"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"mediocre pastiche with an overstuffed, badly paced, rushed plot that still leaves character arcs and plot threads dangling","displayName":"Psi R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T19:51:40.719Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:16:15.209Z","user":{"userId":"798721588","realm":"RT","displayName":"Psi R","accountLink":"/user/id/798721588"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
