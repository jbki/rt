Some scenes lack depth and makes you feel like you blacked out during the movie. As a Star Wars fan, I liked the fan-service but some was too exaggerated. I believe that the JJ and Lucasfilm Team should have stick to what they (and mostly George) think a sequel should be and not go towards what people wanted to see. Aside from the negatives, you will laught, get emotional and...that's it.\nGo, watch it and enjoy the movie as it's the last of the Skywalker saga.","displayName":"Alvaro L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:34:47.822Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:36:04.638Z","user":{"userId":"978453359","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alvaro L","accountLink":"/user/id/978453359"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Love this film.

However, some pieces did not flow right or fit, when Palpatine gather strength for both to grow hands and started walking, got strength to causing galaxy to move by his hand zapping/ bolting. That was not believable.

I have to say, I enjoyed the ride of this movie a lot, and they did a pretty great job of making me like Star Wars again and capturing some of the spirit and fun of the Original trilogy. It's the last chapter in a long saga so there certainly was a LOT to wrap up, but they did a convincing and satisfying job. In addition to that, there is an interesting new story and the characters are the best yet. Rey, Finn and Poe are so much better developed and it feels a lot more like Hand, Luke and Leia on an adventure. Also the villain is fantastic, and even Kylo Ren is great for the first time. The main feedback is, this movie makes both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi WAY BETTER. It takes all the things I didn't like about them and makes them have a point, a purpose and a satisfying fulfillment. You definitely NEED to see this movie. It brought me through a roller coaster of emotions and was a fun ride with a great conclusion that just felt right. Enjoy star wars fans!","displayName":"Tom T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:34:33.676Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:34:33.676Z","user":{"userId":"594e9e93-cf3a-4658-80b1-7f93e3c067fc","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tom T","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is a very good conclusion to the saga.","displayName":"Arthur L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2964331713579069/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:34:32.039Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:34:37.731Z","user":{"userId":"978453470","realm":"RT","displayName":"Arthur L","accountLink":"/user/id/978453470"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Thanks for that last nail Mr. Abrams.
