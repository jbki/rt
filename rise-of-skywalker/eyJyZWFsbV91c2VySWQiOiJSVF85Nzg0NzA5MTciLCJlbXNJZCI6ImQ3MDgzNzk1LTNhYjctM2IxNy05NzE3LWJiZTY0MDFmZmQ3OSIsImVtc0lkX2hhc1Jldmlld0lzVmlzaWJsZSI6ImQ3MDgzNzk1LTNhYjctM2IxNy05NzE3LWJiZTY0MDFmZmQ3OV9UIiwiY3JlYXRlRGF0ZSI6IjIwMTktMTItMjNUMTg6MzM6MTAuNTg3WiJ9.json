Disjointed and gaping plot holes, little time to emotionally digest anything. The contrivances to make this mess of a story move forward are... well here I struggle for words. Nakedly obscene? My reaction at many, many points of the film when something happens is: \"Well, of course\", because the story contrivances are so bad that there is little surprise when the next irrational story \"choice\" comes along.\n\nAs a long time SW fan I did find some enjoyment in just totally disconnecting my suspension of disbelief and let the Star Warsiness flow over me. The actors did everything they could and did it well. Most scenes has flashes which could be enjoyed as SW classic. And, because there is so much SW history, the film managed to pull the emotional strings a couple of times. \n\nThe onscreen emotions, however, only served to reflect the disappointment that is SW as of these three films. The sadness that these terrible storytelling ideas are canon cannot be undone. The damage that Disney has done to the franchise, to this story, is irrepairable. One can only hope that this becomes a very visible, reference example of what can happen when studios inherit or buy intellectual property and do not take the proper care. Star Wars is, after all, the biggest pop culture reference of the last 40 years. Disney has made a real mess of this story. It is true that George Lucas had already started this on his own, and his own ideas also did not seem to have much merit, but Disney did not seem to understand where to take the story either, just happy to replicate the original three films. Rian Johnson's attempt to do something else went to the other extreme - get rid of everything, Ultimately, the sin of these caretakers of the canon was in disrespecting what SW was all about. They all failed.\n\nI give it 3 stars because it is Star Wars and there is enough there to make me care where this finishes. However, the sensation is not the satisfied sadness that it is over. Rather, it is the sad hollowness of what could have been. tRoS was a horrific, misguided attempt to give fans what they want after the previuos two films' failures. It only accentuated the Disney never \"got it\". It highlights the selfishness by all involved to meet some personal agenda instead of being respectful to the franchise, in an original way","displayName":"Christian B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:32:13.667Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:32:13.667Z","user":{"userId":"32d0dc0b-bc3e-40a4-abe5-eec461e297d1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Christian B","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Considering that this movie had to essentially spend a portion of it's time explaining what the hell was happening in the last movie, rebuilding any semblance of story continuation, along with being the end of a 9 movie series, it didn't do a bad job.\n\nI, like many star wars fans will always have qualms. However, I would much rather franchise movies move in this direction or one's like Rogue One, rather than The Last Jedi's direction.","displayName":"Shaun L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:31:19.152Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:31:19.152Z","user":{"userId":"978470908","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shaun L","accountLink":"/user/id/978470908"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved every minute of it.
