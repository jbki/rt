It's a very flashy and expensive but also messy coffin, and for someone who grew up with both original trilogy and prequels to watch and enjoy, seeing this film last night left me angry and sad to see George Lucas' fantastic universe ruined so utterly. If you enjoy fond memories of the original trilogy, DO NOT watch this movie... it will only make you sad.","displayName":"Parker P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:05:40.149Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:05:43.665Z","user":{"userId":"978460092","realm":"RT","displayName":"Parker P","accountLink":"/user/id/978460092"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"C3P0 was the best thing in this movie for me","displayName":"Mauricio V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1080013494/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:05:36.636Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:05:47.543Z","user":{"userId":"906884054","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mauricio V","accountLink":"/user/id/906884054"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"That some of the old characters were brought back.","displayName":"Patricia","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:05:35.186Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:05:35.186Z","user":{"userId":"fd2456e1-3dc6-4e1a-8a46-916742e10979","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Patricia","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing.
