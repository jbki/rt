It seemed like J.J. Abrams was trying to sweep The Last Jedi under the rug and conclude the Saga. In some ways it works, in other ways it's way too complicated with little time for explanation.

Abrams rounded out the Skywalker Saga beautifully. No matter who you are or what you want the film to be, know that this is the ending. If we can forgive George Lucas for editing the originals and bringing us the Prequels, we can forgive J.J. any slights/misses we believe he made. Very enjoyable and thought provoking.
