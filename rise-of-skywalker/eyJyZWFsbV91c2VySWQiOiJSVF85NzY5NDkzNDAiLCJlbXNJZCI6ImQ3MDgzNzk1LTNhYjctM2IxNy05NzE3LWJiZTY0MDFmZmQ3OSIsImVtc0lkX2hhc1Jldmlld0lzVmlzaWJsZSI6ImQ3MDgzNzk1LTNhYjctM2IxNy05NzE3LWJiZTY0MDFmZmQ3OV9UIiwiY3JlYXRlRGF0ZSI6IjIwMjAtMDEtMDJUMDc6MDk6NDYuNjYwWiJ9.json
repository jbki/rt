Lots of noise, lots of stressed-filled faces. There was no humor, it was mostly CGIs, strained acting.  I was ready to sleep plot-wise, after the first hour.  Not so many people in the theatre.  27 for two senior tickets,:35 for popcorn and sodas, and then Santa Monica Parking was another 11.

I'll give you just one example: Ben saves Rey from death. Ben and Rey kiss. Rey looks happy. A SECOND LATER Ben dies and passes into the force (maybe?). Next scene: Rey looks happy and celebrates with her friends. Ben is never mentioned again and doesn't appear as a force ghost. Rey STILL looks happy and is never shown even mourning for Ben.
