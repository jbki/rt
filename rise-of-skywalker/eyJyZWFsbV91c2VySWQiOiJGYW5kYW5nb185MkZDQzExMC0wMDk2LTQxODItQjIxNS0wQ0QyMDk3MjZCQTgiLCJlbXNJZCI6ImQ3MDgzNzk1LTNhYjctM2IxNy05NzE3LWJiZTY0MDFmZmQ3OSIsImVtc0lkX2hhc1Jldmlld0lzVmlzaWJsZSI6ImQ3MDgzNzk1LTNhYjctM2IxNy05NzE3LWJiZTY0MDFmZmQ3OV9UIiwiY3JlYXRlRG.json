The best explanation Iâ€™ve heard is that it is like someone tried to tell the story of a trilogy through Vines. It should have been at least 2 movies but probably 3. It creates as many problems as if fixes and falls to near the bottom, if not the bottom of my rankings. I wanted to love this movie so much but was unable to do so. A sad, anemic, and rushed end to the Skywalker saga.","displayName":"Kirshara","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T05:20:41.378Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:44:08.390Z","user":{"userId":"B8064987-148F-40F7-BB9F-C98937E1CF53","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kirshara","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I thought it was a good Star Wars movie with some plot holes, but JJ Abrams did what he could to clean up the mess from The Last Jedi so I'll give it a half star extra for that.","displayName":"Armando E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10103631964206512/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T05:19:36.957Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:42:22.198Z","user":{"userId":"978444927","realm":"RT","displayName":"Armando E","accountLink":"/user/id/978444927"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Loved it!
