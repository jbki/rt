I initially liked this new trilogy too. Force Awakens was great and even though I was in the minority I liked The Last Jedi. This film has horrible pacing and has the worst explanations for all of the questions in Force Awakens. This is lazy writing at its best and It's more of a sequel to a Force Awakens than Last Jedi. \n\nWhat bothered me the most is this doesn't feel like Star Wars. It feels cheap and extremely rushed. The ending is ridiculously stupid and this film is filled with so much member berries that makes you think \"what?!?!? why? This makes no sense.\"\n\nI don't recommend this movie and if this is the end of the Skywalker saga, which this sequel trilogy didn't really have much to do with the Skywalker's, then it's a very disappointing ending. It's so bad I don't recommend the sequel trilogy at all. Skip it and pretend it didn't happen.","displayName":"Joshua M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:40:43.413Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:40:43.413Z","user":{"userId":"978452893","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joshua M","accountLink":"/user/id/978452893"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"As a Star Wars fan, this movie was great.","displayName":"Robert S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:40:37.633Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:40:37.633Z","user":{"userId":"6EC48D45-46F7-4D13-9D4E-89BDDEBB9AB3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Robert S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"An intense heart pounding adventure that grabs ahold of you from the opening minutes, and doesn't let go for over two hours. It's step on the gas and go adventure, with less exposition than either of the previous two films. It's fun, answers many questions about the series and created a few \"final moments\" that are simply breathtaking. A movie for fans first, and obviously critics second, it will stand out for years to come.","displayName":"Ryan T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/754551042/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:40:27.748Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:40:33.092Z","user":{"userId":"826823701","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan T","accountLink":"/user/id/826823701"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I remember the impact of seeing the 1st Star Wars in 1977.

The Rise of Skywalker managed to preserve and strengthen the only story line I was interested in from TLJ, and did manage to fix some of the damage episode 8 left. There were some clunky moments from the ensemble, but it was mostly a script issue rather than an actor issue. All is forgiven though by the preservation of the overall story arch and original Star Wars themes. I was left wanting more, but that is because there are some great characters that I have really come to love, and I wish there was more.","displayName":"Jane M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:40:20.063Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:40:35.033Z","user":{"userId":"977293161","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jane M","accountLink":"/user/id/977293161"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A little long, could of used one less fight scene. it was a good ending to a 42 year battle of good vs evil.
