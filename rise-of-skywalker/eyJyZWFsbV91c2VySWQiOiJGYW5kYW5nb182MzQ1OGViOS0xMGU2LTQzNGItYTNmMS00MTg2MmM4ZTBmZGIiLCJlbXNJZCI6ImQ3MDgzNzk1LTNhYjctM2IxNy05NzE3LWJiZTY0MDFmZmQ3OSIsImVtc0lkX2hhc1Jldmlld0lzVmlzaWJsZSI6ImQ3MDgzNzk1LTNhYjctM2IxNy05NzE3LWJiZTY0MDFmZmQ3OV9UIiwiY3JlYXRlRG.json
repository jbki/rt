In addition, there were too many jokes at inappropriate times. A lot of character development from the previous film was undone for no apparent reason.\n\nMore importantly, this film failed to give us the satisfying conclusion to the sequel trilogy. A major plot turn at the very beginning of the film was 'explained' with a recycled quote from Revenge of the Sith (2005). The conclusion does not feel like a final victory over evil that would never return, rather as a mediocre action scene.\n\nThe only redeeming quality of this film is the score - John Williams's work continues to be consistently brilliant and magical.","displayName":"Pavel S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2537590166294111/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T09:20:13.713Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T09:20:21.668Z","user":{"userId":"978479420","realm":"RT","displayName":"Pavel S","accountLink":"/user/id/978479420"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Thank God is finished","displayName":"Frank D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1799379870192290/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T09:19:41.091Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T09:19:47.772Z","user":{"userId":"978479428","realm":"RT","displayName":"Frank D","accountLink":"/user/id/978479428"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a great movie!
