Which, sigh. But was the first movie I really think Rey, Finn, And Poe shined. They stepped out of the shadow of the original movies, and, there will be no more. Would watch a new trilogy with just them no Skywalkers.

It took me back to all the fun I had in 1977 when I saw the original film in the theater as a boy.  Negativity, sadly, often over shadows the positivity films like this create for many people.  So, if you want to have a FUN time in the movie theater and enjoy Star Wars, go see it.  This is a movie about space wizards, magic, and laws of physics that only exist in made-up universes.  And it's fun.","displayName":"Jeff H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T16:14:24.359Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T16:14:35.732Z","user":{"userId":"947848543","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeff H","accountLink":"/user/id/947848543"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Considering I was already pretty ticked off Star Wars Fan knowing that there would never be a reunion of Luke, Han, and Leia, I had no great expectations going into this.
