REALITY CHECK FOR THE CRITICS: This is called Science Fiction folks...it's all made up. There is no right or wrong to how the story goes. The general public is lucky that we have talented people on OUR planet that can create and make movies for our entertainment. If you think you can do better...write your own made up movies!!!

Totally baffled. Some spoilers. I'm one that believes Last Jedi is one of the best Star Wars movies ever and I agree with the critics rating of both LJ and Rise of Skywalker. I actually rewatched LJ last night and the difference is night and day. Sure some will complain about the bomber scene, the holdo maneuver and Leia flying through space but the overall story was better, answered questions from the first movie in original ways and took the characters on more interesting paths. Rise Of Skywalker was more absurd than the few issues that were in Last Jedi. Rise of Skywalker was just not very good. After the interesting journey the characters took in LJ, Abrams tries to erase all that and return to the old boring tropes. I loved that Rey was a nobody, now she's Palpatine's granddaughter? Ok, I guess she had to be from some great lineage (sarcastic). Heaven forbid a person who's a nobody can use the force and forge their own path in life without behind dependent on their lineage. This brings me to bringing back Palpatine. There could have been an extremely interesting conflict and journey between Kylo and Rey for this movie, why introduce Palpatine at this time? Retconning the LJ makes this entire trilogy disjointed. Trying to fit what seemed like 3 movies into 1 made for frenetic action and an uninspired and uninteresting story overall. I was actually bored with the first 2/3 of the movie as it felt like fetch quest after fetch quest and nonstop action to distract you from the fact there wasn't an interesting continuation of the story to be told. I gave it 2.5 stars because it wasn't all bad. The movie looked great and had some interesting set pieces. There were some good character moments, especially between Kylo and Rey. Seriously though, this was the worst one since Attack of the Clones. A total disappointment. I was expecting them to take this new trilogy somewhere new. They had the chance to continue that after Last Jedi but instead played it safe, due to a vocal minority, and gave people the same old rehashed ideas. I mean, this movie makes watching the first 6 pointless. This movie committed greater sins than the ones people believe Last Jedi committed. I just don't understand.
