There are some good moments that JJ knows how to create, but he usually undermines them in the same scene or in the next scene. So much fast paced-action that you don't have time to think \"Is what I'm watching bullcrap?\" See it once if you want to see how the saga \"ends\", but I am sure you will forget all about it (like TFA) once you're in the parking lot.","displayName":"Thomas S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:38:34.064Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:38:37.968Z","user":{"userId":"974526719","realm":"RT","displayName":"Thomas S","accountLink":"/user/id/974526719"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Clearly there was no vision for this trilogy.
