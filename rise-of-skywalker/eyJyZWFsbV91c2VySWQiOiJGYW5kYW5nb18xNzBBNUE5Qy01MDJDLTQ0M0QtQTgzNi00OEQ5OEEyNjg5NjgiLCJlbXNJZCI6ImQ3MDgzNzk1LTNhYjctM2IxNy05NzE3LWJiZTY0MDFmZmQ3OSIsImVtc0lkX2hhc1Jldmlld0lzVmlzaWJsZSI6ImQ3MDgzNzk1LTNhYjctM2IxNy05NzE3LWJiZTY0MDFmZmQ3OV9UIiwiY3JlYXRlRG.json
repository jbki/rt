Was a awesome conclusion to the saga.  I could sit here and pick it apart on things that were unexplained, little things I didnt like, etc, but cmon, its STAR WARS!!!  Its for entertainment!!  Its about adventure!!  Its about creating a bond with the characters and going on the journey with them and feeling like youre right by their side.  I saw every movie in the theaters except the original in 1977 (and that was only to being 3 years old at the time).  STAR WARS has been a HUGE part of my life...and while Im sad that the Skywalker Saga is officially over, the adventure will live on in my and my familys/kids lives and hearts forever.

Like many, I wasnt thrilled with the new direction of my heroes lives. I even threatened to boycott this final installment. Well, I got over myself and went. What I can say is that after all the stuff they managed to screw up in the previous two movies, this one ends the only way that it could have, to satisfy longtime original Star Wars fans like me. A sound finish to the story of our heroes.\nGo see it! Watch for the little things.","displayName":"Kevin  B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T04:29:51.641Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T04:29:51.641Z","user":{"userId":"5b862224-30b0-4f40-9f1c-8b14ab8c5737","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kevin  B","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I really enjoyed the movie!

I rate this a \"must see\" because it's a fitting end to the 9 movie Star Wars series.  None of the defects of The Last Jedi which was a terrible movie, and better than The Force Awakens.
