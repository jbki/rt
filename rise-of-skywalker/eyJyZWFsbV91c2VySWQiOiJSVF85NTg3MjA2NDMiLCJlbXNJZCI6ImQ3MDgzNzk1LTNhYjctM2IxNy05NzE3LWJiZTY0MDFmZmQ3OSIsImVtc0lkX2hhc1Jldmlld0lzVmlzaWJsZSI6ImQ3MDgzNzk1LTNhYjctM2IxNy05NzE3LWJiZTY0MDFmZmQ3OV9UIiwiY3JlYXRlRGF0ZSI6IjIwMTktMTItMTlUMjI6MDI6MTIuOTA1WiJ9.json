The 'saga' of the skywalkers becomes that of the Palpatines, destroying all the best moments of the last six movies. For me there will only be three Star Wars movies.

A lot of reviewers find the movie to fan focused and they hate the fact the it changes a lot of the things set up in the last Jedi! But it felt like a Star Wars movies and that's great! I feel like the ending could have been better since it's the ending to a story told over 40 years!
