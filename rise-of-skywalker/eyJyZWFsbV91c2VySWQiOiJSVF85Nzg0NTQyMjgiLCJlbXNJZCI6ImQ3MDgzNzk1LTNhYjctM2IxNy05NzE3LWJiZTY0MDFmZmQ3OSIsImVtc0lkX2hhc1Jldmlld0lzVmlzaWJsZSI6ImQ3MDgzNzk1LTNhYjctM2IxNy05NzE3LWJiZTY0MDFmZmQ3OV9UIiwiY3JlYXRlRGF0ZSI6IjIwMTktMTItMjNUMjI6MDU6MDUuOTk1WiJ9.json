This movie was a convoluted mess, littered with plot holes, recycled ideas, trying to put too much nonsense into one movie, losing direction and coherence. That being said, it was light years better than it's predecessor, and I can't really blame anyone for failing to make a decent film considering where it left the series. I appreciated some of the Rey/Kylo dynamic like the previous films but massive battles and rediculous force powers aren't going to save broken story telling and a slew of unoriginal and what are essentially toothless antagonists.","displayName":"JO J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T21:11:31.985Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T21:11:44.884Z","user":{"userId":"900732423","realm":"RT","displayName":"JO J","accountLink":"/user/id/900732423"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was way better than the aweful prequel \"The last Jedi\".
