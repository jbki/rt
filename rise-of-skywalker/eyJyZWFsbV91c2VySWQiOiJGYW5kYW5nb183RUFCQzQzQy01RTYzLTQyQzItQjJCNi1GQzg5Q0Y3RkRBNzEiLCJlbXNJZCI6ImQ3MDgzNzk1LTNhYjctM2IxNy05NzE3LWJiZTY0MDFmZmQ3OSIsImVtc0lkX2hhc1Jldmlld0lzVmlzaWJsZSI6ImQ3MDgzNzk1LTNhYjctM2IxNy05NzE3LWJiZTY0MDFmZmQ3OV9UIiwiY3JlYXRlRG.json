With an ending most people can appreciate and come to peace with. I’m my opinion is was great ending. I will say in certain scenes they could have done a few things differently. But I am not going to spoil it for ppl that haven’t watched it. Any who, my husband is an old fan and I became a new fan and we were both satisfied with the movie and will watch it again.","displayName":"analia","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T18:40:49.429Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T18:40:49.429Z","user":{"userId":"BF6E29D0-4031-4433-A840-274749F39B04","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"analia","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"a fitting end to the storyline, but a bit ponderous at times, with a few too many throw-in touchstones to the series.","displayName":"ross","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T18:39:54.191Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T18:39:54.191Z","user":{"userId":"1347c9cb-53eb-400d-bfb5-cf8ee13137d3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"ross","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Better than TLJ. Some good ideas, like the Force dyad, that should have been foreshadowed and could have been the narrative arc that tied it all together, but instead was rushed through.

There were so many garbage uses of the great characters that its sad. The knights of ren after being hyped for 2 movies were beaten in a fight you couldnt see because of shitty lighting. Rey palpitine was lame. The spent from the 20 minute mark till like the 1.75 hour mark playing find the mcguffin wayfinder just to have it get broken, and it not matter. And the spent like 4 dialogues retconning episode 8. Just garbage.","displayName":"Ryan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-26T18:37:28.275Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T18:37:28.275Z","user":{"userId":"0ae25963-1a7b-44c2-a3d4-165126c669e6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ryan","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"On the surface, this movie is fun and exciting, but when you look deeper, it completely ruins the entire sequel trilogy by introducing new narratives and questions.","displayName":"Matt B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T18:36:30.320Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T18:36:36.174Z","user":{"userId":"976927964","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt B","accountLink":"/user/id/976927964"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wow!  What didn't this movie do?  its the perfect ending to nearly 40 years of star wars magnificence.  This movie is the complete package with laughs, tears, and an excellent plot twist.

I look forward to what Disney does next.","displayName":"Joseph G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T18:36:10.930Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T18:36:13.866Z","user":{"userId":"978480569","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph G","accountLink":"/user/id/978480569"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I'm a big Star Wars fan and I was not disappointed","displayName":"Batya S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T18:35:03.948Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T18:35:03.948Z","user":{"userId":"a605cec8-aa32-467b-bd60-6fac471d8f1f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Batya S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I thought it was an awesome ending to the series.","displayName":"Lance","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T18:34:57.444Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T18:34:57.444Z","user":{"userId":"97AA0A4C-F605-448C-80E5-A51C8E1A3F5B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Lance","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"}]}
