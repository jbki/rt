Scene changes are so annoying. You start getting into a scene and.. cut, you're taken somewhere else. A lot. A lot of stuff was shown but for no reason. I'd cut some out. And it seems there were scenes cut out. You see a ship flying and in next shot it's crashlanded and crew already walked a mile away from it. It's sometimes not clear what is supposed to be happening in real time and what is a vision. A lot of stuff is just unbelievable, even beyond how much you have to suspend disbelief for all the jedi magic and sci-fi. I didn't like Finn, or Rose, or Kylo, and not even Rey. Adam Driver is not scary. He is too small and does not portray evil and masterdom of universe. Bad casting. In fact most of the characters are bad. I am not a star wars fan, so how the revelations turned out don't really bother me. And they are confusing, about who is whose daddy, and might they be cousins kissing and whatnot. Visually, the film was good. I watched the 3D version and liked what they could do with the effects.","displayName":"Ace W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T00:17:34.678Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T22:05:37.603Z","user":{"userId":"978446041","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ace W","accountLink":"/user/id/978446041"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best move of the nonology.","displayName":"Chris G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T00:17:15.936Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T00:17:15.936Z","user":{"userId":"1ee9b08d-3235-47e8-a21d-11aa295d9208","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chris G","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This actually felt like a Star Wars movie!
