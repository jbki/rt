The Rise of Skywalker goes above and beyond expectations. it has quickly worked it's way to my number 1 favorite in the Star Wars series. it combines old and new to create the most heartfelt and action packed Star Wars movie to date. the spirit of Star Wars is alive and well with this film giving fans the conclusion they deserve to the best Star Wars trilogy.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:33:53.528Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:33:53.528Z","user":{"userId":"260345314","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260345314"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"A noble attempt, but sadly reveals that there was no overall direction for the sequel trilogy.","displayName":"Jason H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:33:50.196Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:33:50.196Z","user":{"userId":"c247c0c9-9889-43dd-9111-0e2fc879c4e6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jason H","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Exacting, mind engaging and entertaining.
