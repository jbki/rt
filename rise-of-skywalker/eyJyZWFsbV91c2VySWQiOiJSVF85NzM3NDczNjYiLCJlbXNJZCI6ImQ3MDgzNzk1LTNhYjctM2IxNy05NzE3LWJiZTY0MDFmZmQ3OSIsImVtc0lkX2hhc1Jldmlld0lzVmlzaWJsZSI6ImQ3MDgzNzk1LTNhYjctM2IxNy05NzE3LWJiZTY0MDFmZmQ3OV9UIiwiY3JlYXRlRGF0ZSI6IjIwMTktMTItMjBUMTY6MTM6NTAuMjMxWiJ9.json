Everything about this movie misses the tone and spirit of the originals; it's just heaps of poorly executed fan service.

With the Rise of Skywalker, it seemingly did its best to mitigate the damage of the previous film by fixing both lore issues and plot holes. It feels more like a direct sequel to the events of The Force Awakens as opposed to being a direct sequel of the Last Jedi and while it is not perfect, both the writing and story are vastly superior when directly compared to The Last Jedi. We were finally given proper send-offs to many of our beloved original trilogy characters and even though the film, similarly to The Force Awakens, plays things too safe at times, the payoffs are some of the most emotionally satisfying within the entire Skywalker saga. Going into the theater I was definitely a bit worried, but when everything was said and done I couldn't stop smiling. Like Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith before it, The Rise of Skywalker is another proper conclusion that the true fans of this franchise were looking for. It gives the sequel trilogy some much-needed redemption and it is easily the best film within the sequel trilogy.","displayName":"Josh H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:11:38.788Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:16:14.449Z","user":{"userId":"976362362","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josh H","accountLink":"/user/id/976362362"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"As a movie so full of action.

But that's not saying much.  Bringing Palpatine back is nothing but fan service.  Everyone can Force Heal now.  Still no training.  There are at least 5 \"fetch quest\" mcguffins in the first half of this movie.  Where there is some mystical object that somehow has all the answers we need.  Palpatine was running hte show the whole time, snoke was a clone.  He's got a whole fleet of Star Destroyers with death star lasers.  Its so stupid.  Why didn't he just use these?  Why did they build Star Killer base at all?  It would take me hours to destroy this movie.  It's horrible.
