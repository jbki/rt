Lacking a coherent storyline, the plot of the new trilogy has to tarnish the originals in order to drive a lazy story in the new films.  Rise of Skywalker continues this trend.","displayName":"Marc C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T18:23:47.490Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T18:23:53.578Z","user":{"userId":"901130700","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marc C","accountLink":"/user/id/901130700"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Honestly I should've just stayed at home.
