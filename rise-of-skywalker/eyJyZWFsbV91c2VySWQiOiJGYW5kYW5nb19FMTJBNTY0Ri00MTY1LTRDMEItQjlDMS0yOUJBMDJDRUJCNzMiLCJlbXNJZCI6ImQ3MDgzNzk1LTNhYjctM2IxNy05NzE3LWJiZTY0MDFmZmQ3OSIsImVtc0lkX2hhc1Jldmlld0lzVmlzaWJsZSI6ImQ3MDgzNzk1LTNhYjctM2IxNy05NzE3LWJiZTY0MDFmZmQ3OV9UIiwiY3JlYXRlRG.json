You will want to skip this movie. Great fight scenes but the message of hope and not being alone is lost in this movie. Kids at my screening were inconsolable. If you've invested in the toys and books, you may want to stay away. Giant disappointment considering Disney is now behind LucasFilm. After having raised my kids with Star Wars, I'm still in mourning.","displayName":"J V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T15:04:43.258Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T15:04:43.258Z","user":{"userId":"978487010","realm":"RT","displayName":"J V","accountLink":"/user/id/978487010"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"A cowardly mash-up of Endgame and LOTR: The Return of the King.

Screen was small, seats uncomfortable, 30+ plus minutes of previews and commercials before the movie started and no TP in the ladies' room.  Wasted another 10 minutes because they didn't put the right movie on at first (started with a standard movie instead of IMAX 3D).  For the price of the IMAX, go to the theater on International Drive.  Huge screen.","displayName":"Stephanie A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T15:01:44.450Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T15:01:44.450Z","user":{"userId":"B3E93C3C-9640-40EC-81F5-118E65E60DD2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Stephanie A","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great end to the saga.","displayName":"Lisa C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T15:01:31.419Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T15:01:31.419Z","user":{"userId":"B50E818C-AE2C-420F-835F-53887820A53F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Lisa C","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"}]}
