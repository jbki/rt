Despite my issues with the TLJ, it was at least a unique take on the universe that had some surprises that felt earned or made narrative sense. It took some risks. This film is cowardly; so worried about upsetting fanboys that it amounts to little more than a bland, by-the-numbers remake of Jedi, just a TFA was a remake of a New Hope. It's almost a direct sequel to TFA and it retcons most of TLJ. The film starts out promising enough and there are a few emotional payoffs, particularly the end of Act 2. Driver is good. It can be funny at times. It's beautiful and the score is of course brilliant. They likely did as well as they could with Leia considering what they had to work with. But the problems are immense and the mental gymnastics required to get past some of the plot holes are beyond me. The big narrative reveals are ham fisted. Bringing back the Emperor is a cheap cop-out that only serves to offer a new (old) Big Bad because Snoke is out of the picture. It is obvious that this trilogy was rushed with no clear sense of the overarching plot points and themes they wanted to explored. I may actually prefer Phantom Menace to this movie, and that one had Jar-Jar in it. As a lifelong fan, I am officially done being excited about Star Wars. Disney has sucked the life out it and turned into just another empty, Marvel-esque property.","displayName":"David S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:52:34.513Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:52:34.513Z","user":{"userId":"978451502","realm":"RT","displayName":"David S","accountLink":"/user/id/978451502"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Way better ending than Game of Thrones that’s for sure.Liked the mind melds between Rey and Kyle Having the emperor around all this time in the form of Snoke was a joke. Didn’t see any humor and when are the stormtroopers ever going to get some serious training. Action sequences are the usual torpid extravaganzas we expect From this series. Having Carrie Fisher in a major role years after she died was kind of creepy. The ending did put it all together and I’m glad the series has run its course.Im sure though we will be seeing plenty of offshoots like the Mandalorian. Good thing Star Wars has a built in fan base.","displayName":"russell g","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:52:23.720Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:52:23.720Z","user":{"userId":"E9F18DAC-51BD-4033-9A83-90798A50901D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"russell g","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Picks up where last Jedi should have.
