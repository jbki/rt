Lame dialogue. Character threads that were left dangling from the previous two movies.\n\nBut the single most egregious, and offensive, act committed by the director - is allowing the last sentence spoken in the movie - to be a lie, which is an offense that a Jedi would never be part of - for it is an insidious reminder of the character's true heritage.","displayName":"The Shadow Knows","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T17:57:14.672Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T17:57:14.672Z","user":{"userId":"0acf70b9-1acd-4373-8b0f-4cb5a7ba802e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"The Shadow Knows","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Hard to live up to generational series of movies but I thought it was well done.
