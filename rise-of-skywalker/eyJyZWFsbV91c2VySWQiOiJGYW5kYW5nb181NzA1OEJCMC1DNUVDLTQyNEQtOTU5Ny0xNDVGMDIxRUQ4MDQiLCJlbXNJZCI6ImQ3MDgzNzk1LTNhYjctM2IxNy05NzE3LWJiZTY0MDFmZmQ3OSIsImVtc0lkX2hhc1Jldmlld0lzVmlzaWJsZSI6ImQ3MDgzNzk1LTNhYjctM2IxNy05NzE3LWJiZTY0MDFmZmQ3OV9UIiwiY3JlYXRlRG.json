For me, this saved me from the horrible experience that The Last Jedi was. The Rise of Skywalker had a great balance of surprises mixed with nostalgia, all the while tying up loose ends and making sense of the previous installment's confusion and pandering. I consider what has been done in this movie brilliant.","displayName":"Timothy B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10218122876958452/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:22:34.768Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:22:41.056Z","user":{"userId":"978461165","realm":"RT","displayName":"Timothy B","accountLink":"/user/id/978461165"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Overall I liked it and will watch it when I marathon the other films.

There was nothing substantively interesting, it all just goes by and before you know it the movie is over. Where \"The Last Jedi\" was a slow, kind-of annoying movie, (though I did actually enjoy watching it, I understand it's not \"technically good\" I know it has some severe flaws, but over all, excluding the scenes with Rose, I thought it was fairly enjoyable. Also the actor for Rose was not bad, she did fine with what she was given) \"Rise of Skywalker\" is wildly fast but still unengaging film. \n\nHowever John Williams does an incredible job once again. and I can't help smiling at anything even remotely nostalgic. \n\nSo I would say look into all the drama with George Lucas and Disney and keep it in mind while you're watching the movie, but also know that this movie had the burden of tying up a series that has existed since 1977 and for what the Last Jedi had done to J. J. Abrams original plan I think they did the best they could. Two and a half stars.","displayName":"Edward K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:21:13.868Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:21:46.882Z","user":{"userId":"978461100","realm":"RT","displayName":"Edward K","accountLink":"/user/id/978461100"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"}]}
