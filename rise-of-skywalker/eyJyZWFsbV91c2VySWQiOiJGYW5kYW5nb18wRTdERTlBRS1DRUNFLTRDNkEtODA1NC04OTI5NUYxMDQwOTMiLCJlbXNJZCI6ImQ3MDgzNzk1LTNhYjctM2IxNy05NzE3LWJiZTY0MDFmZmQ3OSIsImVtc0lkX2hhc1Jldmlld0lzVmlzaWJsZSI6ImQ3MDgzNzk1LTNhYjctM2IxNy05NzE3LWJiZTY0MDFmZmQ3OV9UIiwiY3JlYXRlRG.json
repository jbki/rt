Overwhelming Pace - I thought the scene lengths were too short and changed too frequently especially at the start of the movie. There was a lot of ground to cover in attempting to tie together an entire 9 movie saga which was the reason for some of this however it was still too much.\n\n2. Not the Best Writing - This is a criticism of the latest trilogy but it was evident in the final movie, it didn't seem like Kathleen Kennedy or Disney had an overall clean and concise vision for the story arch of this saga. It was reported that Disney gave full creative control to each movies director, on the surface this sounds like a good thing but I believe it caused most of their headaches when writing The Rise of Skywalker. If they had followed the Marvel Universe model of having an executive producer (Kevin Feige) involved throughout the writing process I think they would have had more success. \n\n3. Rushed - I'm sure having Emperor Palpatine reprise his role in The Rise of Skywalker wasn't part of the plan from the beginning but was a result of Rian Johnson killing off Snoke in the previous chapter. Although I liked seeing Palpatine because he was a great character I thought the way he was used in this zombie like form was a bit weird, using him as a Sith version of the force ghost would have been better. Especially because with him being \"alive\" somewhat undoes the nice arch on Vaders story of bringing balance to the force. \n\nThere were other elements like the searching for Sith and Jedi artifacts which I liked but felt rushed, we didn't really know anything about these or the importance of them prior to the final movie. \n\nIt does attempt to write many perceived \"wrongs\" from The Last Jedi and I did appreciate the attempt to please fans, however there were problems from the previous two movies that couldn't be undone for the final chapter.","displayName":"Jawad M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/528510306/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T19:35:31.853Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:35:36.360Z","user":{"userId":"938186515","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jawad M","accountLink":"/user/id/938186515"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved the story and action.
