The movie contained some surprises in the plot. Some of the special effects seemed slack. It was still well worth seeing on the large screen in 3D about 4 rows back from the screen in a recliner with the wife.","displayName":"V.F.

Don't know why it gets so much hate, JJ Abrams created an amazing ending of the Skywalker Saga. The visuals are insane but it was the audio that stood out for me (including the music).

While I will admit that it feels a bit rushed, I blame Episode VIII for this, as it did not stick to the established storyline. Therefore, this one had to move back to the story that was necessary AND tell the story it was supposed to.\n\nThat being said, it does a phenomenal job. Without spoiling anything, it ties not 3, not 6, but 9 movies together very well. The action sequences are worthy of the (good) movies that preceded it, the alliteration and references to the past saga are well done, and subtle enough that you have to look, which gives it much rewatch value. (Those who focus only on its relationship with Episodes VII and VIII will miss many of these.)\n\nIt's a thrill ride to be sure, and one that keeps you guessing until the very end. Especially when it's revealed that . . . \n\nNo, I wouldn't do that to you. Go see for yourself.","displayName":"Maddman290","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:43:55.824Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:43:55.824Z","user":{"userId":"a9511892-61c0-4171-aad4-bd2a167fab93","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Maddman290","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Super fun movie! Definitely a must-see for Star Wars fans. Reminded me of the first one, but makes sense since the director for the first one did this, too. Characters were great, even better than The Last Jedi.
