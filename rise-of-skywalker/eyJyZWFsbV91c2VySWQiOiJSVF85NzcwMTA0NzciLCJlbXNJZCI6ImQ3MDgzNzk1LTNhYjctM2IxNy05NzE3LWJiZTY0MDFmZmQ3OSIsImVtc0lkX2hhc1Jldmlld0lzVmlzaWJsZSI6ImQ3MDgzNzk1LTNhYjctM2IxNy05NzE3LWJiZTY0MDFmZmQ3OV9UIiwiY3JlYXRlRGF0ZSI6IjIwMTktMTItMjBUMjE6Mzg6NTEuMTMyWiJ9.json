There are too many places and there's so much wasted potential, the force has many new abilities that we get no explanation about and for some resone rey is stronger with the force than anakin (aka the jedi with the highest midichlorian count ever) and has better control over it than yoda with zero training. Rey acts like a sith, she fights with her emotions instead of concentration and acts without thinking, that is how a sith fights, not a jedi, rey will even kill if she has the chance and thats against the nomber 1 rule of the jedi. The last battle was boring and much too short and made no sense. This movie truly was, the worst star wars movie ever created.","displayName":"Tal H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/553525665198497/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:38:40.233Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:38:51.173Z","user":{"userId":"978453460","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tal H","accountLink":"/user/id/978453460"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Very satisfying ending.

On paper, the plot points are a bit chishé. They were also pretty predictable, but the rollercoaster of events kept you second guessing.

TROS has distinct lack of plot holes, less annoying characters and a more structured story. A shame this had to all be squashed into one film, where this part should have been building, we should have seen the Emperor before this. However, as a standalone film it is enjoyable. What really drags it down is that a) Rey doesn't die, and b) the whole, \"I am Rey Skywalker\" thing. But I really enjoyed Emperor Palpatine, and the new take on him. Truly disturbing. I also loved the First/Final Order scenes, they were beautiful, dark and sinister. Richard E. Grant was fantastic as Admiral Pryde. \n\nIt really was a tough job, to do a third film and make it stupendous, when you have to retcon and build something from the first two very pointless, plotless films. I hope Star Wars is never again disrespected like it has been through these sequels.","displayName":"Alan F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:37:50.611Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:37:57.709Z","user":{"userId":"978307021","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alan F","accountLink":"/user/id/978307021"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie overall was a great movie for any fan of the star wars franchise.
