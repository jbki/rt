But the Disney aspect was apparent in everything. So theres a bit of cheese factor that made it feel geared towards kids. Some fun scenes like the crazy waves in the water. But now we can heal with the Force? And we can pull things from other worlds ? Not crazy about how Disney is rewriting the rules. But oh well - this one is definitely better than the previous two.","displayName":"DarrinD","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:03:33.665Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:03:33.665Z","user":{"userId":"c90d35eb-fda2-45f9-8fce-dc42899ab9ef","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"DarrinD","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"A little too reliant on past films in the franchise, heavy-handed references, formulaic and predictable.
