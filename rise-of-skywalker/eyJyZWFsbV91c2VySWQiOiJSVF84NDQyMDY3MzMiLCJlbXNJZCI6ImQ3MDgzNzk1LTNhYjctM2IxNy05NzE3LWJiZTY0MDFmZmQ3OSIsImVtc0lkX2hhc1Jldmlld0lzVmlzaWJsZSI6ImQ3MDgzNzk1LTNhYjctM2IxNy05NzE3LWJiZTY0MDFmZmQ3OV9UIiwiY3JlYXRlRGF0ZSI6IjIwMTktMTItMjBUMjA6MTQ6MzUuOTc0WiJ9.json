While that should have been worked out from the jump, it wasn't and the flow from one episode to the next felt stilted. RoS fixes a lot and provides a largely (but not completely, but that was always going to be next to impossible) satisfying finish to the Skywalker Saga.","displayName":"Rich W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10106630994979758/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:14:21.019Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:19:59.872Z","user":{"userId":"976928195","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rich W","accountLink":"/user/id/976928195"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"The narrative was all over the place.
