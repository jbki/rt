It's full of Fan Service and at times self absorbed but that all works in this final installment of the Skywalker Saga!\n\nAbrams manages to interject long standing Star Wars lore from all media from the Films, Animated Series and Comics into the story. Sad they had to contract alexia's role but the use of the previously shot footage was seamless.\n\nAs someone who was there the Summer of â€˜77 and with every Star Wars film since I was 100% satisfied with The Rise of Skywalker!!!","displayName":"Ray F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1209354489/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T08:02:37.977Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T08:02:47.548Z","user":{"userId":"872550551","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ray F","accountLink":"/user/id/872550551"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"A few hours of meh. The movie falls flat on all regards, plot is predictable. The fight sequences never gave you a feeling that they were even trying. And for some reason, the empire lowers exposes their single point of failure, for no reason, repeatedly.\n\nWeak, boring, not worth watching and I'm upset I wasted my money.","displayName":"Wade M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/539685676628647/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T08:01:32.130Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T08:01:37.739Z","user":{"userId":"978473436","realm":"RT","displayName":"Wade M","accountLink":"/user/id/978473436"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"John Williams' music and the SFX are just awesome, and the acting is quite passable this time. But the story is frankly, just silly, with wall to wall action attempting to divert audience attention away from the shallow, cardboard cut-out  characters and ludicrous plot holes, before finishing the saga with an ending stolen from \"Return of the Jedi\". I left the theatre feeling distinctly underwhelmed - missing that euphoria I had felt as a teenager leaving the original trilogy movies. Those movies had a magic quality, whereas this felt more like, well, just another movie. 2/5","displayName":"Rob A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T08:00:18.269Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T08:00:30.401Z","user":{"userId":"977286992","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rob A","accountLink":"/user/id/977286992"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!!
