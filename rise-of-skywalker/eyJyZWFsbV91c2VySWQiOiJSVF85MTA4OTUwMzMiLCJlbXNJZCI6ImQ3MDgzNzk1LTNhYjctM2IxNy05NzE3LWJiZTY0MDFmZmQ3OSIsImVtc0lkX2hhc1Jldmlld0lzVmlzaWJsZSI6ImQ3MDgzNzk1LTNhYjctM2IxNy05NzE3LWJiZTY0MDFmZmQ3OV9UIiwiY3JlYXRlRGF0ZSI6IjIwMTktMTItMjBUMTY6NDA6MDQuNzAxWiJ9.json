If you're a Star Wars fan I think you'll be thoroughly impressed. \n\nIf you wanted to change Star Wars instead of creating your own new franchise then yeah you may not like it. \n\nYou can easily enjoy TLJ and RoS or you could hate TLJ and love RoS. It's been made in such a way that it accounts for TLJ but it doesn't depend on it in anyway. Nothing really happened in TLJ that permanently impacted anything other than Luke's disappearance and his ultimate fate. \n\nSo just go and see it.

I’m over this era of over-analyzing every film that comes out like it needs to be a gosh darn masterpiece. Here’s a news flash: Star Wars as a whole are NOT cinematic works of art to be compared with the likes of Casablanca and Good Will Hunting. They’re silly space-action films with questionable dialogue and fun space scenes. Just go to the film and enjoy it instead of launching an investigative analysis into a series made for children.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:39:24.332Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:42:14.072Z","user":{"userId":"886879060","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/886879060"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
