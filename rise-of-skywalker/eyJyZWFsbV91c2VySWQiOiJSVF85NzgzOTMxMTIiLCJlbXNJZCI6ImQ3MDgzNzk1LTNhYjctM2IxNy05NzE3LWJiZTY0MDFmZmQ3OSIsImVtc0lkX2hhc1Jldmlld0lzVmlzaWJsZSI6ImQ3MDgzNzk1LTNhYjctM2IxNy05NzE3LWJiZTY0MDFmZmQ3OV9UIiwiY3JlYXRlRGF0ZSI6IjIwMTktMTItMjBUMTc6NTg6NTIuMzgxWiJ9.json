What The Last Jedi failed to do with exposition, TROS had to go at it at 100 miles per hour, but in the end gave an emotional strong finish!

Let's face it, it's a big space opera (which I can enjoy because I don't suck all of the joy out with nitpicking ) and at the end of the day, this story, like most hero stories, has always been about the struggle between free will vs. destiny, and overcoming our demons, both the ones we choose and the ones thrust upon us.  And in that, this story succeeds well.","displayName":"Cathleen M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/608219434/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:58:31.672Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:58:42.652Z","user":{"userId":"915521434","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cathleen M","accountLink":"/user/id/915521434"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent finale to the saga and a welcomed course correction after The Last Jedi.
