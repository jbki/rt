Dialogue and writing were pretty atrocious too. I wasn't even wild about TFA and TLJ but those were objectively better than this. Rogue One was great and The Mandalorian is pretty great but this just did not land with me. I'm puzzled at how this made the final cut. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but had I known how bad this was, I never would've paid to see it.","displayName":"Trevor W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/504712616/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T19:18:57.250Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T19:19:09.595Z","user":{"userId":"918596728","realm":"RT","displayName":"Trevor W","accountLink":"/user/id/918596728"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"No plot twists or surprises.
