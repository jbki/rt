I think people will definitely fall on one of two sides. If you loved The Last Jedi, and thought it was bold, innovative film making that took the story in new directions, you aren't going to like The Rise of Skywalker. However, if you are like me, and thought The Last Jedi was a garbled mess that made no sense, then you will love The Rise of Skywalker. JJ Abrams had a lot of work to do in order to right the ship, and there is a lot of hand waving to dismiss key decisions made in The Last Jedi, but I was all for it. This actually felt like a Star Wars movie again and was a great end to the latest trilogy.","displayName":"Steve S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T14:45:51.922Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T14:45:56.519Z","user":{"userId":"976976480","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steve S","accountLink":"/user/id/976976480"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"saw it in 4DX  Real 3D -- totally awesome!","displayName":"K550","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T14:44:59.555Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T14:44:59.555Z","user":{"userId":"bccd301a-4744-4776-b10e-7fb7630efcd5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"K550","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Besides having a great direction and a nice picture, the scenario is so dumb that you can not like this movie. In addition to be inconsistent with the 8th episode, the story is kind of stupid. The scenario looks like one of a poor video game with characters looking for useless macguffin in one place after another but always conveniently finding it. The past episodes took a lot of liberty with the starwars lore, but this time JJ Abrahams really pissed on it : the force is real magic , everything becomes possible.\nAnd at the end you cannot help but think : what did this episodes bring to the whole story ? Finishing the saga on the 6th episode or at this episode doesn't change a damn thing .","displayName":"louis r","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-26T14:44:16.805Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T14:44:30.672Z","user":{"userId":"978338840","realm":"RT","displayName":"louis r","accountLink":"/user/id/978338840"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Good movie, not much new stuff though.","displayName":"Demetrius G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10211607505160332/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T14:43:51.711Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T14:44:03.338Z","user":{"userId":"975896949","realm":"RT","displayName":"Demetrius G","accountLink":"/user/id/975896949"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best movies Ive ever seen!","displayName":"Josh N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T14:43:50.804Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T14:43:50.804Z","user":{"userId":"a524a439-141f-4509-9ae9-5c37c25a47f1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Josh N","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I thought they did a great job of wrapping this story up.
