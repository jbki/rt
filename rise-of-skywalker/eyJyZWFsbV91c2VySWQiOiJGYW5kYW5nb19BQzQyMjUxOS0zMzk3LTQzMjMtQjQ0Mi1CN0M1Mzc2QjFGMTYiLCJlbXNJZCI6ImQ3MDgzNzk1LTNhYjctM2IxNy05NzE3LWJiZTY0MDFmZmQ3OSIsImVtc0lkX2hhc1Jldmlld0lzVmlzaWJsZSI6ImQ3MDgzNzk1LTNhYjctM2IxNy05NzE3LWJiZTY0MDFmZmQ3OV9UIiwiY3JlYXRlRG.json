There were some odd dialogue choices and the beginning was far too rushed but it was likely the result of using elements from TLJ and getting to where they need to for TROS. The question is of they really needed to conclude the Skywalker saga with this trilogy or go in a new direction (starting with TFA). However I dont think there were anymore plot holes than any other Star Wars film. And the soundtrack was incredible, as always.","displayName":"John","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T20:45:28.180Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T20:45:28.180Z","user":{"userId":"48a7adc7-09d6-483d-99fe-c85e1b526891","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"John","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Shame on you George Lucas for allowing Disney and J.J.
