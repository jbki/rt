From the very start its GO GO GO! It truly feels like JJ wanted to take his vision for Episode 8 and 9, and was forced to make it all into one movie. The pacing is off but the entertainment is a great time. We see characters we've come to love from this trilogy go on one final adventure! The acting is the best of the trilogy (Especially Adam Driver) and characters from pre-Disney Star Wars make their return. While I didn't LOVE the explanations for some of the new things introduced, I can appreciate Lucasfilm and Disney for expanding the lore of this galaxy far far away. If you want a well made movie with a typical movie structure and good pacing, this isn't for you. However, if you want to see a fun, ll action, Star Wars adventure moving to close out the Skywalker Saga, this is a good movie for you.","displayName":"Samuel Z","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T15:53:04.709Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T15:54:58.246Z","user":{"userId":"977851870","realm":"RT","displayName":"Samuel Z","accountLink":"/user/id/977851870"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"star wars Rise of skywalker is bad movie, I like to say it was good but it was big let down this should of been endgame for star wars and it just bombs","displayName":"Jack B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1847634865286755/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T15:51:51.843Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T15:51:51.843Z","user":{"userId":"977250370","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jack B","accountLink":"/user/id/977250370"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good movie from beginning to end but I feel this shouldn't have been the last one, a lot of things felt rushed , this felt more like a sequel than a finale,  the movie should've been 3hrs long , Not the finale on the level of Avengers endgame that I expected.
