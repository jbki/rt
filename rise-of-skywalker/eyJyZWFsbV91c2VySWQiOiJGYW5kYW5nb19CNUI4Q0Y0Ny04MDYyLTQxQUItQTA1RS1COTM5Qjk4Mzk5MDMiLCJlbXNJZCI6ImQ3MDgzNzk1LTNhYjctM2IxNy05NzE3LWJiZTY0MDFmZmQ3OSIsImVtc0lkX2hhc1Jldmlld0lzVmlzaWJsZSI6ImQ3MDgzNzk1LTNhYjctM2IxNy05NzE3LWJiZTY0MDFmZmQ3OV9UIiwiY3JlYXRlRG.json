I definitely prefer the original Star Wars movies, but this one was the best of the newer movies. The storyline and actions sequences were great. I only gave it 4.5 instead of 5 because I feel like they didnt explain some main plot points enough, but other than that, it was pretty perfect.","displayName":"DY Williams","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T17:21:44.963Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T17:21:44.963Z","user":{"userId":"8e5d91e8-7573-4d5f-a88d-a752e5c11703","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"DY Williams","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"11h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Lots going on-maybe too much to try and wrap up the saga in a neat box and bow.","displayName":"rvfonda","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T17:19:57.374Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T17:19:57.374Z","user":{"userId":"5A860919-AF60-42D3-B0AA-88A51359111A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"rvfonda","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"11h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"A mess of fans service and sloppy writing.
