But that being said, taking into account the limits set on the writing team and story, it's fine. It's not going to be remembered for any epic scene or moment, it's going to be remembered as the last one that ended the saga, that's it. It was nostalgic and predictable. But.... It's over, and a part of me hates that it is. The force will be with us, always.","displayName":"Yashwant S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2813510188669350/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T13:58:35.239Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T16:01:14.518Z","user":{"userId":"978449409","realm":"RT","displayName":"Yashwant S","accountLink":"/user/id/978449409"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"This truly is the worst Star Wars movie ever made.

Lots of action with surprises and twists. If you are a Star Wars fan, it tugs at you emotionally, but wraps the saga up well. I saw Star Wars (what would later become A New Hope) in 1977 as a kid. It's my favorite movie of all time.  I put this installment up there with A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back and I can't wait to see it again.","displayName":"Michael S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T13:26:16.756Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:35:54.413Z","user":{"userId":"977293158","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael S","accountLink":"/user/id/977293158"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"JJ did a great job telling an entertaining story that completes the trilogy and the saga.  The Last Jedi's epic misfires left JJ with little to work with.  But he did it well.  His efforts actually make some of the things that happened in Last Jedi come across better.  This movie is entertaining as the Star Wars and Empire were. It allows the new characters to work together which is a good thing.  The relationship between the characters in the original trilogy is such an important part of why that trilogy works.  It was absent or forced in the Last Jedi.  It was present in Force Awakens and here those relationships and characters further develop.  Excellent story telling, particularly given the difficult spot the last film left the overall story and franchise.","displayName":"S H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T13:25:49.724Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T04:53:51.794Z","user":{"userId":"977315741","realm":"RT","displayName":"S H","accountLink":"/user/id/977315741"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Seeing people score opposite of critics speaks volumes.
