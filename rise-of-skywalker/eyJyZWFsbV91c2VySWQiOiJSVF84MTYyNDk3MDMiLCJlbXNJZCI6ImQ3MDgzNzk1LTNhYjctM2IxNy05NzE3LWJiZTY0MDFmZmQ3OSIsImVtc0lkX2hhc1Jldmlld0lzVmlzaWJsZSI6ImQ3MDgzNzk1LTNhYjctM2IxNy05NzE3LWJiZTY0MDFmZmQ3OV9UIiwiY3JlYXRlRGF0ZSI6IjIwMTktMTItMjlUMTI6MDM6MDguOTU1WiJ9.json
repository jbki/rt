However you really should to watch it a second time to soak in the charm since the pace is indeed quite fast. And make sure you read the explanations on the www before the the second time and then you'll have that AHA! or YES! moment. Don't listen to them critics. They only know to critique but can't even make a movie themselves, with real constraints and widely divergent ideas from team members. At the end of the day, it's one of the best Star Wars movies - in my humble opinion as a long time fan. ;)","displayName":"Martin C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2657563830998772/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T11:31:45.131Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T11:31:55.963Z","user":{"userId":"978489354","realm":"RT","displayName":"Martin C","accountLink":"/user/id/978489354"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"}]}
