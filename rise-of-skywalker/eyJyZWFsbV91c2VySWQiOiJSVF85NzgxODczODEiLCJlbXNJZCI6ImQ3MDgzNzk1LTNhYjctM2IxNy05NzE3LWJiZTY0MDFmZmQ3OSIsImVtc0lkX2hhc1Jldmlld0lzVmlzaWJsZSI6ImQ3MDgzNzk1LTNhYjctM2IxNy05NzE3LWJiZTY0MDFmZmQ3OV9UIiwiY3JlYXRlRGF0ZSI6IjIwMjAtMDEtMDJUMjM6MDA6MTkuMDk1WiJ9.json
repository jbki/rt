For a movie franchise as old and long as Star Wars, they definitely could have done a better job wrapping it up.  Most viewers that I speak with agree it was a good movie.  However, it is apparent that this last installment in the skywalker saga, a movie series that has been 30 years in the making, fell short of the it's deserved and long-awaited potential.  That is why I only give the movie a 3.5/5.  \n\nIf we are only talking about the trilogy (7-9), I would give it a 4/5.","displayName":"Ryan D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2557559231124130/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T22:53:41.873Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T22:53:46.855Z","user":{"userId":"978499317","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan D","accountLink":"/user/id/978499317"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"}]}
