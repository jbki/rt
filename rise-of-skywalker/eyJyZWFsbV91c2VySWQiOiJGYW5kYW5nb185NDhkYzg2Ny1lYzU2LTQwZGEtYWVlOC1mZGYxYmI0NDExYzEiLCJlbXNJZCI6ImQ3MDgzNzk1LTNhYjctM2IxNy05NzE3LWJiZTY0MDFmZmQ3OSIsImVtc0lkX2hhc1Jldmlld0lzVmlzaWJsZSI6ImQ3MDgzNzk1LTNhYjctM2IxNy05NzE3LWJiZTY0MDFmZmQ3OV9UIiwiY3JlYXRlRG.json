I think they did a great job of finishing the series.  I get people's problems with it but half the people would have been upset with any ending.  The reality is that The Rise of Skywalker is a fun film, a visual masterpiece, and an acceptable way to end the series.  They could have turned it into two movies...but could you imagine the uproar then.","displayName":"Robert","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:50:44.597Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:50:44.597Z","user":{"userId":"8847825d-1337-4e74-b6fd-0fc83858a83b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Robert","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Pure entertainment, don't expect too much depth or canon coherence.","displayName":"mark q","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:49:08.399Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:50:21.563Z","user":{"userId":"901310364","realm":"RT","displayName":"mark q","accountLink":"/user/id/901310364"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I liked the way it tied it all together with the other movies","displayName":"Scott B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:49:06.026Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:49:06.026Z","user":{"userId":"25D197C1-2344-4C7A-A212-A20E6510A01A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Scott B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"So corny...entertaining but really not up to par with other Star Wars","displayName":"Tracy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:45:24.330Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:45:24.330Z","user":{"userId":"89f13eca-7194-4a6e-90ba-9a3d27d4a656","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tracy","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was good to see all the classic characters together in this movie.
