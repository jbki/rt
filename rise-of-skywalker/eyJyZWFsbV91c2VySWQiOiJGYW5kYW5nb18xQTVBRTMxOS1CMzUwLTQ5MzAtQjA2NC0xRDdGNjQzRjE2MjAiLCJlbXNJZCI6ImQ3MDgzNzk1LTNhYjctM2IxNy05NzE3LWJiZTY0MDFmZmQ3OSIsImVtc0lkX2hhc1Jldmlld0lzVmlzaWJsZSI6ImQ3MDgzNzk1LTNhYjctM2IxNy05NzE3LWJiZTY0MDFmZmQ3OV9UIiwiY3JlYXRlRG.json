It's a good movie, but an OK Star Wars Movie. They should have made 2 movies out of Rise of Skywalker and not do The Last Jedi. Good thing is that the movie is made so you don't have to watch TLJ anymore.

This movie was just amazing I don't care what the \"critics\" say.  The critics expected another storyline mess like TLJ-but obviously those critics aren't actual Star Wars fans not even casual ones.  I tip my cap to JJ Abrams, the cast and crew of The Rise Of Skywalker for making it a fitting ending to a 42 year old saga.","displayName":"Ross M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10203059434302144/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:27:16.362Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:27:23.021Z","user":{"userId":"978466457","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ross M","accountLink":"/user/id/978466457"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great ending to the saga!
