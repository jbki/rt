Watching it with true Star Wars nerds is the best way to view Rise of Skywalker. They have social issues but are part of the resistance. We left beaming with huge smiles. There is a lot of fan service but who gives a hoot? The scenes with Leia are poignant. Kylo and Rey carry this film. Rose should have got her kissing scene.","displayName":"Margaret B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1052428413/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T16:14:42.157Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T16:14:54.132Z","user":{"userId":"845244752","realm":"RT","displayName":"Margaret B","accountLink":"/user/id/845244752"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of my favorite movies in the franchise.","displayName":"Derrick H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/12112664/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T16:14:33.750Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T16:14:47.880Z","user":{"userId":"789062105","realm":"RT","displayName":"Derrick H","accountLink":"/user/id/789062105"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Not disappointed at all.. lots of Easter eggs","displayName":"MUD 1.0","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T16:14:32.350Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T16:14:32.350Z","user":{"userId":"0140C0B2-50A6-46AA-8D56-5D484FB4BD78","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"MUD 1.0","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"If you are a fan of the original trilogy, it was a worthy send off.
