Some cheesey moments that could have been left out but other than that I really liked it. Been a fan of the originals.

Filled with genuinely good visuals, cinematography and music. It's sad how the story, the thing that matters the most is not up to the standards when everything else is going so well.","displayName":"Sudeera S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/538689893143285/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:01:51.240Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:06:10.119Z","user":{"userId":"976629526","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sudeera S","accountLink":"/user/id/976629526"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Even JJ could not overcome the terrible storyline of the Last Jedi.
