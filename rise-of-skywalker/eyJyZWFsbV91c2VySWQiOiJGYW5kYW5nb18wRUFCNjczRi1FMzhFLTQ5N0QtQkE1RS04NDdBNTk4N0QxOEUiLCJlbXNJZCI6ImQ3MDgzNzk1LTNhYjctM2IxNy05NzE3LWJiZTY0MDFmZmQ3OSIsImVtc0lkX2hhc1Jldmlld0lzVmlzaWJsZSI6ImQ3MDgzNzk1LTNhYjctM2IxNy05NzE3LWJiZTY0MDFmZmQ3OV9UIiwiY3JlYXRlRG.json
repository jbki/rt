This movie is great. From a die hard Star Wars fan, I will be paying to see it more than once in the theater. Super fast fast and 2.5 hours long...so much packed into it, I have to rewatch it. People are being hyper critical of a movie meant for kids, and some of the best special effects in movie history. Better acting than the old Star Wars films we grew up on, tons of original cast cameos, twists and shocking ending. The message is clear, the future is in the hands of the youth. Older cast supports as mentors but itâ€™s all about the new heroes while respecting the past.

While the movie was okay, it left points making me wonder what they were trying to do. \n\nIt felt like they took elements of Return of the Jedi and copied and pasted and just added new pizzaz. I am a bit disappointed, but also somewhat happy. They could have done better in my opinion and they could have done a lot worse.\n\nLet the Skywalker legacy die with this movie. Move on to something else. Explore the Old Republic, do something else. Leave this time period alone. It's been beaten to death and back.","displayName":"Ian H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000155965383/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:26:22.716Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:26:28.124Z","user":{"userId":"907810139","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ian H","accountLink":"/user/id/907810139"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"good visuals, much of the action scenes did not make alot of sense for being a star wars movie, quite confusing story arc in the trilogy that didn't really get finished","displayName":"Travis P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2804712916217580/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:25:51.388Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:25:58.613Z","user":{"userId":"978466696","realm":"RT","displayName":"Travis P","accountLink":"/user/id/978466696"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie!
