It is a fitting conclusion not only to the new trilogy,  but to the Skywalker saga as a whole.

I'm about 30 years old and have loved Star Wars since before I could remember. I vaguely remember asking my mom to rend empire strikes back when I was about 2 or 3 years old. The story has always inspired me and the universe always intrigues my imagination and the good vs evil elements are always my favorite. I love all the movies however I do understand people's frustration from the Last Jedi, while I enjoy it for what it is and some of the scenes are still very exciting, it was ultimately a filler movie it seems like. Rian Johnson was very selfish in his movie and just wanted to make a movie that was \"structured\" well but didn't care about what Star Wars meant. The rise of skywalker does its best to save all that while delivering a very exciting and solid ending to the skywalker saga. It is a love letter to Star Wars and very satisfying in many ways even if it is a bit chaotic in the beginning.","displayName":"Tyler V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/803274336785263/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:31:36.563Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:31:36.563Z","user":{"userId":"978442573","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tyler V","accountLink":"/user/id/978442573"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing, loved the story, loved the action and loved the fact it made up for the dumpster fire that was The Last Jedi!","displayName":"Mike S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:30:54.006Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:30:54.006Z","user":{"userId":"C1CC891D-15D7-4F65-A7FB-B1B7D5B42BCD","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mike S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The plot was all over the place did not make sense","displayName":"Taylor G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:30:52.581Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:30:52.581Z","user":{"userId":"4C104EA1-FF33-49E7-8F88-CF5496C5B1C2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Taylor G","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"}]}
