Past the callbacks and fan service there really isn't anything to redeem this awful trilogy. While it was great to have a million references to the originals, that's not what makes a good movie. The acting is terrible, dialogue poorly written, and fight sequences, lame. The ending story was so cheese and a very Disney play. However the ending visual was chilling and couldn't be happier that this mess is over. If you're a casual star wars viewer you'll probably think nothing about how this story invalidates the original 2 trilogies, and trashes their stories and sacrifices. It rewrites the lore and just tosses aside all the build up from the last movie. They introduce characters not important to the plot or even well written/exciting parts to them. I feel it's very lazy and feels like they rushed it for some reason. It's depressing to see such a giant go out like this but at least for now. It's out of it's misery.","displayName":"Tyler R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T20:27:47.069Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T20:27:56.302Z","user":{"userId":"978477572","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tyler R","accountLink":"/user/id/978477572"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Nice ending to the Star Wars saga.","displayName":"Arthurlee M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T20:26:47.553Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T20:26:47.553Z","user":{"userId":"3F81F4DF-89B8-43FC-A544-91CFC6DF3300","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Arthurlee M","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I felt trapped watching this. It just kept going and going and didn't care whether I cared about anything that was happening. I mean, it might've been better if there had been a second movie, but they tried to fit two different movies into this one, and it was an absolute failure. Not even funny bad, just bad bad.","displayName":"Jake L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T20:25:55.656Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T20:26:01.370Z","user":{"userId":"921286304","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jake L","accountLink":"/user/id/921286304"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Five stars great movie","displayName":"john c","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T20:25:37.695Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T20:25:37.695Z","user":{"userId":"6A3FE68B-8876-4C5A-A058-ABA777C55F0D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"john c","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Absolutely amazing movie great to watch","displayName":"Luis B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T20:25:09.016Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T20:25:09.016Z","user":{"userId":"EA4AC0A2-047A-4503-8C15-A3E6425CB327","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Luis B","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Love it.
