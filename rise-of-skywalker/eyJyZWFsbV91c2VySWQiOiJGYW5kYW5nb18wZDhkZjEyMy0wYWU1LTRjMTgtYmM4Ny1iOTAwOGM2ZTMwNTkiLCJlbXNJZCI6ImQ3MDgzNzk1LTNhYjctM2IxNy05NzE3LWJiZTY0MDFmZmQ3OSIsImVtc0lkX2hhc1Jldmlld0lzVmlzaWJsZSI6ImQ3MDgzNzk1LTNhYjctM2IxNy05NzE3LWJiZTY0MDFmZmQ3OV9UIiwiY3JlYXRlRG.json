Never quite touches the mythic depths of some of the series earlier films, but a worthy conclusion of Lucass uneven but highly influential 43-year project. Not an Oscar-worthy film, but Lucas clearly deserves a lifetime achievement award. Plus, the original series may have saved the local movie theater industry. Well done.","displayName":"Gary David","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T10:10:31.808Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T10:10:31.808Z","user":{"userId":"193a4ed5-9ed2-4bf4-9c30-abbe9aba1f6b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Gary David","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"19h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Very choppy.
