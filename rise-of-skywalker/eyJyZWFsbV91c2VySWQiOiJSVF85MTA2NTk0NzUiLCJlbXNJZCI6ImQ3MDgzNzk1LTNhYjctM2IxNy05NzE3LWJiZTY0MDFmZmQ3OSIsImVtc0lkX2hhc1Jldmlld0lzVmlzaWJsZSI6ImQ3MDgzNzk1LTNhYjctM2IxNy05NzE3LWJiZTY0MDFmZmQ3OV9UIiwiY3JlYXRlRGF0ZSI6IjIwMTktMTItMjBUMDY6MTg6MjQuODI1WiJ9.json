I believe this is a great movie and the best of the new trilogy.  There is lots of exposition in the first act.  This is done to get the story back on track after Rian Johnson butchered the trilogy story arc in The Last Jedi.  But the payoff for all the exposition is worth it.  The Rise of Skywalker is the real Star Wars that fans have been wanting.","displayName":"Tom H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:13:44.094Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:57:22.819Z","user":{"userId":"976684088","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tom H","accountLink":"/user/id/976684088"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Id say it deserves a 90%...at very least...tho it moves along pretty fast, it is a great entry...tho a lil more storytelling would have solidified it a new modern classic, it has some really colorful heart felt moments...as well as dark disturbing moments that are borderline Sci Fi/Horror... serves as a chapter that sides with episode 3 revenge of the sith...and return of the jedi...And more a sequel to Force Awakens...This chapter serves many wonders, as to where Star Wars will head next...!! JJ does an awesome job...Dont believe the negative hype, and see it yourself, it does a nice nod to the original trilogy as well...no spoilers..If TLJ and Solo, were not ur cup of tea, this film pushes forward in a faraway galaxy and succeeds! (A, A-) At a 58%, it clearly should be flipped around to a 85% Fresh Tomatoes..As fans can agree, its good.","displayName":"D G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100006363901518/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:10:13.715Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:20:44.845Z","user":{"userId":"954323792","realm":"RT","displayName":"D G","accountLink":"/user/id/954323792"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Flawed, a bit too fast (could've been longer), but a fun send-off to 42 years of film.","displayName":"Scott I","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100008063372990/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:09:38.009Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:30:57.513Z","user":{"userId":"969136341","realm":"RT","displayName":"Scott I","accountLink":"/user/id/969136341"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It was an enjoyable watch but the plot left a lot to be desired.

Well crafted. Funny when it needed to be. Powerful when it needed to be. If you are not a fan of Star Wars this movie is not for you. How could it be? As a child born into a Star Wars generation (1984) I cannot remember a time before being a Star Wars fan. From watching A New Hope on my Dad's Betamax to buying engineering diagram books of the Death Star. Star Wars and all the original characters have been with me my whole life. I am pretty sure I am named after Luke Skywalker. I love all the Star Wars movies. Love is not always happy or perfect but it's Love. I was frustrated with the prequel and eventually frustrated with the original trilogy for many reasons, always hoping for a better movie. Abrams trilogy has its flaws but every Star Wars movie does. Terrible acting in A New Hope. Luke Skywalker being kind of a bitch in general. Empire Strikes Back's slow pace and lack of progression of the story. Clone Wars' unnecessary side stories. Every movie has it's problems. But it's all Star Wars. What Abrams has accomplished in Rise if Skywalker in tying 8 movies with plot holes galore, bad acting, loose and ever changing Canon, one dimensional characters to tell a story of finality is truly incredible. Every character from over 40 years of stories has their place. Every plot has some semblance of conclusion and most are tied off. The ones that aren't are going to inspire and launch new Star Wars franchises. All of which any true fan should be excited for. Thank you for wrapping up my 35 years of fandom.","displayName":"Luke G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/651812817/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:08:41.162Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:31:16.742Z","user":{"userId":"907272524","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luke G","accountLink":"/user/id/907272524"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Epic!!!!

Get over your apprehensions. It is extremely gratifying. I'd say that it's the darkest of all Star Wars, yet the happiest too. And the most unbelievable thing to me, is that it TRULY ends the Star Wars/Skywalker Saga. I can't think of any other franchise that gave a finale that was so concrete. No loose ends. Only satisfaction. Way to go, Disney & kudos to J.J.
