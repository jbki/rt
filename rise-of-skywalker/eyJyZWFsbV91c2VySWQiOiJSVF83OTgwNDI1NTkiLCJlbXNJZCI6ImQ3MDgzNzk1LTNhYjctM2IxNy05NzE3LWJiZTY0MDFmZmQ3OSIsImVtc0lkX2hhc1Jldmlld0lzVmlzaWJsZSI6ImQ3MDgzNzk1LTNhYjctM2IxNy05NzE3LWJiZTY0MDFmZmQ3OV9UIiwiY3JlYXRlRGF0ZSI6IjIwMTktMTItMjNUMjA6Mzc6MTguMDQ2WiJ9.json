Indeed, I felt that The Last Jedi worked to destroy the character of Luke Skywalker as we knew him. Now, in Disney's last chance to prove itself on the Star Wars front, it does just that, returning to old motifs and delivering an ending that nearly redeems this entire new-age trilogy in my eyes. My major critique is that, especially for JJ Abrams, much of the dialogue was corny and at times felt like I was watching a bad sit-com. Despite this, both the action scenes and inner-conflict that presents itself within our characters allow The Rise of Skywalker to conclude the new story in a memorable and graceful way.","displayName":"Luke A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1336985603175466/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:35:50.981Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:36:03.625Z","user":{"userId":"978471358","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luke A","accountLink":"/user/id/978471358"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great effects.
