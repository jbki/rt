It's a fun, messy movie that manages to thrill but should have slowed down and had more focus. The Rey and Kylo stuff is all great. Ian MacDermid is incredible. Some of the Leia stuff is wonky but considering the tragic situation this production was put in I'll totally give them a pass on that. Some of the worst parts of the story feel like bad fan fiction, and unlike The Last Jedi this movie isn't taking bold chances and diving into new territory. This movie is, for better or worse, all about tying things up with a bow. But it's full of action, comedy, heartfelt moments, and some great new characters. Unfortunately it's also full of sloppy, convenient writing. It isn't the best Star Wars movie by any means, but it's still a satisfying enough conclusion to their story.","displayName":"Mark B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10207070579863756/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T22:31:34.744Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:25:53.272Z","user":{"userId":"826386050","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark B","accountLink":"/user/id/826386050"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Just a re-tread of previous films and themes.
