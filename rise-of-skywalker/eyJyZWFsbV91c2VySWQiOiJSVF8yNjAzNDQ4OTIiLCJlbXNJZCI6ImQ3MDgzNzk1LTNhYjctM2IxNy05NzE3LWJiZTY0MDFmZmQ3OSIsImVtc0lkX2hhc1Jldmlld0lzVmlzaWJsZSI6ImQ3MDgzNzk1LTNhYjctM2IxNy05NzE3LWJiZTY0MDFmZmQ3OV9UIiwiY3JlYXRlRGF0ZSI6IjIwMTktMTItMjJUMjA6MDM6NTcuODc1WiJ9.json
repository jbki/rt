Was it a perfect movie... No. \nWas it entertaining... YES!\nUnless you loved TLJ (this movie fixes RJs mistakes from that movie), you will enjoy this last outing in the Skywalker saga.\nPlus if this movie tanks, Disney will not do anymore for a while and I for one want to see a KOTOR trilogy!!  So please, don't listen to the critics and see it yourself and then make up your minds.","displayName":"David H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/515526202/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:03:37.680Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:03:44.389Z","user":{"userId":"795020931","realm":"RT","displayName":"David H","accountLink":"/user/id/795020931"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Disney just making money.
