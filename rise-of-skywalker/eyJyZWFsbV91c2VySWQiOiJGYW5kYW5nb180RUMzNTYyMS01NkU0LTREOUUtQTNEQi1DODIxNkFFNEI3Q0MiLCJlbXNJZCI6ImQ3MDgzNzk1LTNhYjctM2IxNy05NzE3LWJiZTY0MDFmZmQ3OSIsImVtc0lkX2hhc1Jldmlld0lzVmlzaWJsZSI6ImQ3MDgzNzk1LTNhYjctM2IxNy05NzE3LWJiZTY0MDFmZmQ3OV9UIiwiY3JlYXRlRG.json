Still though too much of a forced, no pun intended, story. Stories exist in books for what happened after ROTJ, good stories, but greedy Disney tossed them all in the trash, and came up with this scatter-brained sequence of events. Episode 7, 8, and 9 definitely did not bring closure to the saga. It damaged the saga, permanently.  Plus force transferring physical objects, is ridiculous. If that is how the force works then why didn't any other jedi use it to help each other out.","displayName":"M F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T05:15:15.810Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T05:17:03.138Z","user":{"userId":"976965992","realm":"RT","displayName":"M F","accountLink":"/user/id/976965992"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"23h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Boring and predictable.
