The plus side is that when It did slow down for some intimate moments I actually found myself enjoying it. However most of it is just flash and no substance, like a Michael bay film. \nAt the end of the day I still found myself enjoying the nostalgia moments, but when the film finished I felt like I'd watched a expensive fan film and not a real conclusion to the films I enjoyed as a child.","displayName":"Dino A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002549527377/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:52:35.218Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:52:54.787Z","user":{"userId":"911147831","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dino A","accountLink":"/user/id/911147831"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"star wars died in shame!","displayName":"Ilidio C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/592506816/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:52:31.142Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:52:31.142Z","user":{"userId":"938722403","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ilidio C","accountLink":"/user/id/938722403"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Could be better, damage control","displayName":"Samuel F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:52:28.546Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T22:19:10.845Z","user":{"userId":"978453108","realm":"RT","displayName":"Samuel F","accountLink":"/user/id/978453108"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Much better than TLJ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:52:27.749Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:52:27.749Z","user":{"userId":"260343595","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260343595"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It was a good movie, but the plot was so fast that it tripped over itself at times.
