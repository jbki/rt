I did not like The Last Jedi, and gave a bad review because of it. but this film did a decent job of saving the epic story.  It just felt more like a real Star Wars, and it did tie up a lot of loose plot holes from that last film, and delivered a better and even a little unexpected story line.  Though I did feel there were some loose ends with this film, it had a much more cohesive story.  Kudos JJ, you saved the classic epic!  I would recommend this.","displayName":"Stephen S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2020-01-01T05:00:01.580Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T05:00:08.445Z","user":{"userId":"976967883","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stephen S","accountLink":"/user/id/976967883"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely loved it!","displayName":"Bea","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T04:58:37.997Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T04:58:37.997Z","user":{"userId":"5953c147-30ae-46e3-bb96-193e316b8581","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bea","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Didnt like the ending and some parts were repetitive.","displayName":"KJkids","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T04:57:42.096Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T04:57:42.096Z","user":{"userId":"aaffd508-0a55-4b04-b112-331410711489","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"KJkids","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The final Skywalker trilogy is incoherent in terms of its story telling.
