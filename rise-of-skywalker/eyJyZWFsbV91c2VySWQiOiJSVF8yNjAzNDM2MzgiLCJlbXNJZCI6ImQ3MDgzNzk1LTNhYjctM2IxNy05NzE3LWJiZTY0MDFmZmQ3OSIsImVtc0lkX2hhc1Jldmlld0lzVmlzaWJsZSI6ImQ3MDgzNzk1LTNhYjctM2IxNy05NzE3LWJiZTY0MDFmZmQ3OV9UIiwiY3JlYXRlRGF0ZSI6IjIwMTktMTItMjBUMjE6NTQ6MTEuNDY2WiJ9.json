Many scenes individuality entertain but feel strung together with no concern for suspension of disbelief. The First two acts are better than \"the last jedi\" however the last act goes from impressive...to cringworthy...to finally.... leaving me feeling sick to my stomach for some reason saying \"disney why would you do that\". Still not sure why. I can accept it as an episode but as a skywalker saga finale, for me, fails so bad it hurts.","displayName":"Jeff M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/656657645/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:49:57.710Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:50:02.582Z","user":{"userId":"910016664","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeff M","accountLink":"/user/id/910016664"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
