From a storyline perspective, Disney dropped the ball. I didn’t care for them bringing the Emperor back I thought that was lazy storytelling. This film didn’t connect well with the first two films. There were a lot of unanswered questions. I’m disappointed that Disney didn’t do a better job at mapping out the entire trilogy better.","displayName":"Jawon S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T22:02:37.934Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T22:02:37.934Z","user":{"userId":"54656896-2672-444C-9525-6A95C8DB90BF","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jawon S","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"best movie of this trilogy.","displayName":"Kevin J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T22:02:15.662Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T22:02:15.662Z","user":{"userId":"3C5D5273-3F23-47F8-9E9B-8FBEA0227276","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kevin J","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely Amazing!!!","displayName":"Shanda","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T22:02:03.153Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T22:02:03.153Z","user":{"userId":"B8BA695E-657D-4232-84E3-292FCF3AA8D9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Shanda","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I liked that all the original characters came back, even as spirits, in this movie.  Also, there is hope because, again, we have a Skywalker.  I don't know that I want them to make any more sequels.  One must know when to stop.  But, they may have that in mind by bringing the name Skywalker back.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this movie.  I went because I went to all the others, but did not expect as much as I got.  Way to go, George Lucas!","displayName":"Joan C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T22:01:37.885Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T22:01:37.885Z","user":{"userId":"81d593f6-396e-41a3-802d-80f94baa7ccb","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joan C","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Made no sense.
