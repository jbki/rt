There were some flaws and yes, not all of the new trilogy questions are answered, plus I do have more questions...but that is actually a good thing. The major plot points are wrapped up and I'm fairly satisfied, especially given what the Ep9 crew inherited and had to work with. Honestly, this could have easily and maybe should have been a part 1 and part 2 two and half hour or more movie. There is just alot.more that could have been fleshed out and let us sink our teeth into. However, it's not glossed over to the point that we don't care. \nIn hindsight, if you added a few small parts of Ep8 and Ep9 to The Force Awakens, tweaked and added a few small ep8 parts to this... then divided Rise of Skywalker in half, then this would have been a much better trilogy.","displayName":"James H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:10:38.145Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:10:45.215Z","user":{"userId":"976939933","realm":"RT","displayName":"James H","accountLink":"/user/id/976939933"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This movie had a lot to do and was never going to please everyone.
