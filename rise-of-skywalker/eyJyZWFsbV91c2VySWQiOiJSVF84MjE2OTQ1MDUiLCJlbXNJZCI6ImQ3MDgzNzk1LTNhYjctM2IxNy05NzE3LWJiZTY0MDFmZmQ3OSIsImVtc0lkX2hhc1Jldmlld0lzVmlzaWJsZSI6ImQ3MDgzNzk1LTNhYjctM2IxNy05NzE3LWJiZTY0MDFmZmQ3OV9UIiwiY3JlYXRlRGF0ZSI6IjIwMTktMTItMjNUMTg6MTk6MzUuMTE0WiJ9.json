The visuals are stunning but the story and script are embarrassingly bad.   The Star Wars universe provides so many opportunities to create a compelling trilogy storyline and they stuck with the safe and boring mcguffin workflow.  The only thing that could have made it worse is throwing in a jar jar.  I think the smaller side-stories in the SW universe (ie mandalorian, rogue one) are where the gold lies.","displayName":"Michael B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10100799253302962/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:19:22.910Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:19:38.088Z","user":{"userId":"977545175","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael B","accountLink":"/user/id/977545175"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Maybe if I didn't know the lore or history.
