The Force Awakens was amazing in introducing the new characters and mystery. The Last Jedi mostly disappoints with subpar story and underwhelming plot twists. Not to mention destroying 42+ years of hardcore fans emotional investment to this franchise/universe. The Rise of Skywalker has an amazing story, action sequences and visual effects that will please both casual movie goers and diehard fans alike. \nJ.J. Abrahams truly knows how to bring the Star Wars universe to the big screen, with his signature satisfying plot twist and surprises, and amazing set pieces. Definitely a big screen worthy movie experience.","displayName":"Mark M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T02:53:49.904Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T05:17:23.111Z","user":{"userId":"1de74bd2-002b-439a-bb10-df8f7fde2b32","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mark M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Loved the whole ending sequence.
