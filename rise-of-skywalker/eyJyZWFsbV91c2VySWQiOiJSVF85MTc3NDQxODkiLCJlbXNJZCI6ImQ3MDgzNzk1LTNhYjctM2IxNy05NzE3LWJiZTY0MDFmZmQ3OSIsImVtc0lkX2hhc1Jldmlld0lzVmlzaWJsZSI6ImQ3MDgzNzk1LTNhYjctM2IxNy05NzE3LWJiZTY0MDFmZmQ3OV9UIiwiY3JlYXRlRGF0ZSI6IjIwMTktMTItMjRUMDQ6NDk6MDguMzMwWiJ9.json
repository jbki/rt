Bottom line, Im content with how things were resolved.\n\nThe effects were good, the acting wasnt terrible, not going to say this was a perfect movie, there were some unlikely twists that make you want to roll your eyes, but in the end the overall resolution was what I wanted and well done.  I will definitely be seeing this one more than once in the theater.","displayName":"Miradawn","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T04:49:03.698Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T04:49:03.698Z","user":{"userId":"c86b143f-10d9-426b-aa19-d933003953e1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Miradawn","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best star wars  moving in the series","displayName":"Google","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T04:48:36.262Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T04:48:36.262Z","user":{"userId":"c847e53c-6f3d-4986-ad7f-b7ab96a7437f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Google","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"really the only complaint I have is that the ending could've been better.

Standout performances from Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley really sell the story beats and the arc of the film.  Plus the addition of fun new characters like Zori Bliss, Jannah, Babu Frik and Dio always make for a good time. \n\nI believe Director and Co-Screenwriter J.J. Abrams had a near impossible job to do in wrapping up this trilogy and saga and he stuck the landing in my view. Every major character (past and present) got their moment to shine. While it is not a perfect film, I loved how it danced with \"The Last Jedi\" and tied the bow on the sequel trilogy's major themes.","displayName":"Will L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T04:47:24.846Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T04:47:24.846Z","user":{"userId":"971964348","realm":"RT","displayName":"Will L","accountLink":"/user/id/971964348"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I liked the whole movie.
