Visuals were great and the story galloped along at a rapid pace (almost too fast in places). Loses half a star for the first 20 minutes being a bit too all over the place trying to get everyone up to speed. Some genuinely great callbacks to both the original trilogy and the prequels.","displayName":"Adam R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/507193421/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:34:25.658Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:34:32.482Z","user":{"userId":"792537882","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adam R","accountLink":"/user/id/792537882"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"I felt it was ok at best..As a whole I feel like the entire trilogy was an opportunity missed by Disney/Lucasfilm...but I guess that's what you get when there is no real plan heading into a trilogy.","displayName":"Ian M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/515036991/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:34:19.397Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:34:33.506Z","user":{"userId":"910718449","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ian M","accountLink":"/user/id/910718449"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Worst Star Wars ever. I wrote a pretty long review on IMDb and gave it a 1/10. If you're a real Star Wars fan you'll understand why these people with not that much training having MCU-like powers isn't logical. Many people who haven't read the lore comics or have watched all the movies will like it because they don't understand. Oh, I  forgot to mention that you can now stop lightsaber attacks using the Force. Like, what? Are Force barriers gone now? The script for this last trilogy just doesn't make sense in the Star Wars universe.","displayName":"Emil S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10206338984149694/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:33:43.863Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:33:52.065Z","user":{"userId":"978442117","realm":"RT","displayName":"Emil S","accountLink":"/user/id/978442117"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"As always.
