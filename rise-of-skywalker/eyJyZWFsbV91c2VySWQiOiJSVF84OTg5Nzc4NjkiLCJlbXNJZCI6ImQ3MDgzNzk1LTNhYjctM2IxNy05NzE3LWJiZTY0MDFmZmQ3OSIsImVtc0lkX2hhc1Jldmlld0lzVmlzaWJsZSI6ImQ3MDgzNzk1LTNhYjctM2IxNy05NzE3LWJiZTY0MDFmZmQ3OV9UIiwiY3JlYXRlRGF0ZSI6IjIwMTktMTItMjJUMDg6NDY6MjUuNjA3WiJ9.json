There just wasn't anything spectacular about this film. The acting was fine but the writing wasn't great and in some points the dialogue just made me cringe. There were some solid parts in the middle but they failed to materialize into anything. The plot was quite frustrating, convenient about sums up this story. There were also parts of the plot that forced you to just go with it despite how little sense they made. Its quiet obvious scenes were cut out because there are glaring holes in the development of certain characters and scenes. Unfortunately this whole trilogy was awful and this subpar film couldn't do anything but finish burying it.","displayName":"Brett M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T07:55:58.419Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:48:47.079Z","user":{"userId":"977693082","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brett M","accountLink":"/user/id/977693082"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I watched this movie and was very happy with it.  Fast paced and action packed.  I knew it would be better in 3D and it was by orders of magnitude.\nI know this movie was very ambitious in tying together all 8 preceding movies in the Skywalker saga and the plot and characters in the new trilogy.  While some are sure to take exception to the way the plot  was developed and the storyline, I feel they did all they could to conclude it in coherent fashion.  You can always prefer different decisions were made, but the execution of the plot was outstanding.   Im liking this more, the more I think about it.","displayName":"James","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T07:46:28.645Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T17:13:58.472Z","user":{"userId":"cbf81a2e-3107-45e6-af12-761e63db4c54","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"James","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"great movie all around","displayName":"MATHEW C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T07:38:27.654Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T18:26:18.283Z","user":{"userId":"82A36D6F-BAD8-4896-A3BA-3F1E76E3B474","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"MATHEW C","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Excessive in the wrong areas and underdeveloped in the right ones.
