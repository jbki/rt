I truly don't understand the hatred around the movie.\n\nGreat adventure, a lot of well driven nostalgia mixed with a fresh new story and even nice and cool plot twists.\n\nDisregard de backlash and the negative comments. Go with a fresh mind. \n\nMaybe not as good as the original trilogy (what is?) But still a very good 2 hours of pure star wars entertainment.","displayName":"Chus M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T19:52:19.365Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T19:52:34.192Z","user":{"userId":"787909259","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chus M","accountLink":"/user/id/787909259"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Some parts were so slow with plot that people fell asleep.
