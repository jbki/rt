It's a means to make money and sell toys--I've made my peace with that. The art design is great. The scenes are all composed well. But it's basically a Fast & Furious movie now. Death is not only completely meaningless in Star Wars--I'm now questioning why Luke doesn't just defeat everyone as a Force Ghost, because he's shown to be perfectly capable of affecting the world and using the force as if he were alive. Rey and Kilo are capable of fully omniscient, except for the times the script says they're not. Also, there may be regular ghosts in Star Wars now. I say \"may\" because it's unclear. \nWhatever. Star Wars is dumb.","displayName":"Nicolas C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1333665466/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:25:34.885Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:25:43.154Z","user":{"userId":"912864800","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nicolas C","accountLink":"/user/id/912864800"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This is the year of disappointing finales indeed, yay (?) I went into the cinema with zero expectations, I still came out disappointed. Never had I wanted to leave the cinema as badly as when I watched this absolute garbage of a show.\n\nPlot: 1/10\nDialogue: 1/10\nActing: 1/10\nLight saber fights: 1/10\nSpace battles: 1/10\n\nEverything about this pathetic attempt of a movie was terrible. Just total, absolute, garbage. There are b-grade movies and animes that you only watch with drunk friends, and those were better than this.\n\nPlease. Let this die already.","displayName":"Phyo K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/755639674470912/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:25:33.776Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:25:42.323Z","user":{"userId":"976281854","realm":"RT","displayName":"Phyo K","accountLink":"/user/id/976281854"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved it.
