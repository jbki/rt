Unfortunately, they weren’t given much to work with. The plot was overstuffed and many of the crucial plot/world building points were just completely under-explored or not explained. Similarly, the reveals/twists don’t feel earned and what the story is trying to tell is unclear. The pacing was insane and many of the other technical filmmaking aspects, though not awful, weren’t nearly as good as the two previous films. In the big picture, it feels like this film, and the trilogy as a whole, really suffered from lack of cohesive vision, from a plot perspective and from a thematic/storytelling one. It’s impossible to not contrast this with Avengers Endgame & the MCU, which has its own flaws, but has always had the ability to tell individual stories that were unified in the collective vision. The movie had too much weight/importance to not see if for yourself, but be warned, it’ll likely disappoint you.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T16:27:20.153Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T16:27:20.153Z","user":{"userId":"260347256","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260347256"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best in the series!
