I am not a Star Wars fan.  All I can say is the movie is a bit too long, keep it the 2 hours mark or shorter.  If it's good, then people long for more, if it's bad then at least you don't dread it on for too long.  Because of all the praise on Adam Driver, I think he is borderline over rated now.  The cast overall is good.  I keep hearing this one is trying to right the wrong the Last Jedi did.  I don't know what would that be.  One thing missing is the feeling between Finn and Rose or rather Rose towards Finn, Rose basically is missing in action in this final one.  Maybe that's the wrong in the Last Jedi?  I have no idea.  Then of course there is the mystery and annoyance deliberately left behind by Abrams, What does Finn want to tell Rey?  Abrams is annoying in that way.","displayName":"NC17","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:33:59.495Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:33:59.495Z","user":{"userId":"879e39ad-ac0b-4ee7-889e-a2be1788f8a1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"NC17","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"movie was awesome especially when Luke convinced REI to never give up","displayName":"KRISTINA","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:33:44.631Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:33:44.631Z","user":{"userId":"1B02712B-29A3-4CCB-ADFB-F54E874112B0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"KRISTINA","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"good way to end the Skywalker story","displayName":"its ight","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:32:25.931Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:32:25.931Z","user":{"userId":"B33930AB-0431-4F6E-B057-3C7F3EEE1EF1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"its ight","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I really enjoyed it.","displayName":"Alexander F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:31:07.876Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:31:15.040Z","user":{"userId":"977305281","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alexander F","accountLink":"/user/id/977305281"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I LOVED this movie! it brought all of the plot lines together and gave us a completion to the Skywalker Saga!","displayName":"Rebecca","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:31:03.253Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:31:03.253Z","user":{"userId":"93880A5A-6AA5-4DE4-BB70-954FD13198C3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rebecca","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"While the visuals and plot weren't inherently problematic, much of the cinematography and dialogue left me with more questions than answers. Sometimes, faster cuts and lots of camera movement feel like a trick to make you see less of what's actually happening, and jumping straight into new concepts of how things work with no dialogue about the mechanics is confusing, rather than a powerful visual illustration. While this movie at least completed the story arc of the new trilogy, it left me feeling like I've just spent a lot of time investing in characters and a plot struggling to get me to the same happy ending as Episode 6 (Return of the Jedi). The result: fast pacing, less friendship between the characters, and more dependence on throwbacks to the old movies to keep the thing alive. The best piece of new storytelling was the Kylo Ren/Ben Solo story. That brings the movie up from 2 starts to 3.","displayName":"David W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:30:27.419Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:30:27.419Z","user":{"userId":"52AE0E0E-2F71-41A2-9090-09F86CB85CC7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"David W","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"judge for your selves if you are a true fan you'll love it.","displayName":"Moris","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:28:35.498Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:28:35.498Z","user":{"userId":"A6A69A9A-964F-4651-99B0-F513FC4C95F6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Moris","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Entertaining, keeps your attention, answers all the questions, cool cameos.
