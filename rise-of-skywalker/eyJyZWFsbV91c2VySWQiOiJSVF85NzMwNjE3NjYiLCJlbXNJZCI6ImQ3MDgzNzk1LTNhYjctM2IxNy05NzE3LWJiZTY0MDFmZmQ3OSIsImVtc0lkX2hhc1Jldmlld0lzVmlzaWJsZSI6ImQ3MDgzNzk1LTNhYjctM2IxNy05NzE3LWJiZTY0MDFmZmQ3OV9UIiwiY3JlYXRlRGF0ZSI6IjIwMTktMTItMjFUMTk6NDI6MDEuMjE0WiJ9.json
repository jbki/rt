J.J. Abrams is a master storyteller, picking up the shattered pieces of \"The last Jedi\" and crafting it into a satisfying ending for the old and new generation of Lucas's imaginative Characters. I found myself caring for the new team as they found their stride and camaraderie. I want to see more. Hats off. Childhood is complete.","displayName":"Clint H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/766727145/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T19:41:58.613Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T19:42:24.986Z","user":{"userId":"918888597","realm":"RT","displayName":"Clint H","accountLink":"/user/id/918888597"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie from start to finish!","displayName":"Jeff F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T19:41:42.283Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T19:41:45.077Z","user":{"userId":"978460599","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeff F","accountLink":"/user/id/978460599"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"The ending ruined the movie for me.

The next story is a mess. You can see that nothing was planned after episode 7.  The actors did an amazing job for the poor script. The effects are nice but it's too be expected from a Star Wars movie. \n\nIt's suppose to respect old characters and come to an end to the original trilogy which already had a satisfying ending. This extension just ruins what was established in the originals and doesn't make any sense.","displayName":"Ariel G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/178595800202784/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T19:41:30.483Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T19:41:48.989Z","user":{"userId":"978460614","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ariel G","accountLink":"/user/id/978460614"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I felt like I watched 4 movies in one.

My 10 year old thinks it's the best movie ever. I think it's a great Star Wars movie. Just pure entertainment and fun. Wrapping up a 9 movie series, comics, novels, tv shows, etc... should be full of fan service. Anyone who says otherwise just doesn't understand the importance of pure entertainment especially for a series made for kids (of all ages).","displayName":"Brent W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T19:41:17.856Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T19:41:25.711Z","user":{"userId":"978460628","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brent W","accountLink":"/user/id/978460628"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Never again start a giant trilogy with no plan.","displayName":"Facu S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1450212602/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T19:41:09.930Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T19:41:09.930Z","user":{"userId":"862744260","realm":"RT","displayName":"Facu S","accountLink":"/user/id/862744260"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This movie definitely has high expectations from the audience and while it wasn't filled with many \"unexpected\" moments, it's a great end of an excellent saga.
