It was lego Star Wars at times undeniable fan service and the ending was probably too Disney. There was some nice middle fingers to the second movie and I think JJ did the best he could finishing the saga and fixing what the second film did wrong. I could see why the critics would hate this movie but it wasn't made for them.  This was a fun, made for fans film.
