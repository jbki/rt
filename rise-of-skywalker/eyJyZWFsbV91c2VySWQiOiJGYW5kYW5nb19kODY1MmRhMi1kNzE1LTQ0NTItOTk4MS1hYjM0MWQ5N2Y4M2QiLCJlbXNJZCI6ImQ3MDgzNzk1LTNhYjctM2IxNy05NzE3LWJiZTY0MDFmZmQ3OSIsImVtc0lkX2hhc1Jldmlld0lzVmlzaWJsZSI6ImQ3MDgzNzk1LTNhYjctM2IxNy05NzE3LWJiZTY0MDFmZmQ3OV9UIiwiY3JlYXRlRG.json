The cinematography was good too. But the story line was too convoluted and muddled. With an over emphasis of dialogue explaining actions and what's going on didn't help either.

It was fantastic to watch the epic conclusion of the Skywalker Saga, especially if you were disillusioned by The Last Jedi. Of course, it's not a perfect movie (Rarely exist, perfect movies do). It could have easily been prolonged by at least an hour, give or take, as the pace was both lightspeed figuratively and literally. It also assumes that a sinister villian from the saga's past (Not going to spoil it) manages to survive his unfortunate predicament many years ago... which will blindside you if you aren't forewarned about this. Oh yeah, and the movie does not want to kill anyone outright in this movie... you'll see what I mean in multiple cases. Finally, the last flaw is this: This is a Control+alt+delete of many aspects of TLJ, for the better or worse. You can quickly assume why. (Im going to be honest, JJ should have had this trilogy to himself. Rian Johnson screwed with us in so many wrong ways)\nDespite these flaws, I do not regret seeing this movie on opening day and I look forward to seeing it again to catch details I overlooked in that showing. If you want a Star Wars film, that while doesn't exactly line up with the flawed trilogy it belongs to, stands out as amongst the best of its trilogy by itself, this movie is a must-see, despite TLJ fanboy critics attempting to taint this movie.","displayName":"Travis B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:04:06.988Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:38:13.679Z","user":{"userId":"978480152","realm":"RT","displayName":"Travis B","accountLink":"/user/id/978480152"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fantastic artwork, beautiful settings, much more serious theme, huge surprises, and satisfying ending that is new-ish.

It cramps a lot of useless and important stuff in one and can't deliver it properly. Chewy presumably dies and a few minutes later you already know he lives. Also a lot of the fight choreography is just utter shit. To slow and how they hold the light sabers is just an insult. \"Let the past die\" Disney wanted to go a new way and let the old things go. Well they didn't do that. A lot of references and old characters came back just to kill them off. The force has been made trash with force healing and force flying. Has this become avatar the last airbender? Now rey is the Jesus avatar and has connections with all the past Jedi? Wtf Disney what a trash movie.","displayName":"Mees d","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:02:24.158Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:02:25.490Z","user":{"userId":"978480177","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mees d","accountLink":"/user/id/978480177"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a good story in its own right - even if it doesn't really explain everything that went on in the previous movies. It also had a strong message as did the first ones - the message was lost for a while in some of the middle movies. While it had new characters, bringing back many of the \"old timers\" was a fun bonus. Not only is this an appropriate wrap-up of the entire series, it is also a very obvious launch-pad for many new story lines. Daisey Ridley probably had a lifetime career ahead of her if she wants it. By the way, five of us watched it - aged 41 to 80 - and all enjoyed it.","displayName":"John F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:00:46.584Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:00:46.584Z","user":{"userId":"9671c882-3c1f-407c-835e-8bd7f269c0d4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"John F","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"The film felt rushed, many plot points were forgotten, the ending was crap and Ben Solo deserved better...","displayName":"Ree W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:00:28.192Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:00:32.705Z","user":{"userId":"978480165","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ree W","accountLink":"/user/id/978480165"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"}]}
