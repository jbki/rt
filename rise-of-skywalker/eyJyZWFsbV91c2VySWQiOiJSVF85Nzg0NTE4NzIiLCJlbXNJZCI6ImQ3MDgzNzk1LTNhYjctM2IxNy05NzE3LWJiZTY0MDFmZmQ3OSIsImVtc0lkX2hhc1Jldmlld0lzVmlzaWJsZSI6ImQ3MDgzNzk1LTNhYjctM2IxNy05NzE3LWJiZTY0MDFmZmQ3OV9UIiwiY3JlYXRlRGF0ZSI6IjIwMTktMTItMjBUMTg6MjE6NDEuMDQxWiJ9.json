Did not really connect with episode seven and eight and the writing was a little sloppy. The pacing felt rushed and this movie could have honestly been split up into two to better explain everything. You will leave the theater with lots of questions which is a little annoying considering this is the last episode in the franchise. Visually it is probably one of the most beautiful Star Wars movies ever made however. Definitely go see it if you are a Star Wars fan so you can finish up the story.","displayName":"Chrissy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T18:21:28.421Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T18:21:28.421Z","user":{"userId":"A0FAFDDE-3729-489A-8746-2825E4749A96","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chrissy","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This film is brilliant, worth a watch.

While it had a couple of moments, it was tough to enjoy them unearned at a break-neck pace. The so-called \"fan service\" moments were anything but to those who have engaged in the multi-media SWU (canon books, comics, games), oftentimes flying in the face of established canon. Truly a dissapointment.","displayName":"Jennifer C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1067022609/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T18:20:08.146Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T18:21:36.698Z","user":{"userId":"811976196","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jennifer C","accountLink":"/user/id/811976196"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
