But this wasn't bad at all. Plenty of nods to the original trilogy, spectacular space battles and epic back drops.  If I had one criticism it would be the plot is slightly week in a few places. Won't say where as don't want to spoil it. But it does seem they had to put some shaky science in to bolster why they were having to do what they did in the finale. But hey, overall pretty awesome.","displayName":"Bruce H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10219374187728012/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:22:05.362Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:22:24.795Z","user":{"userId":"978026544","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bruce H","accountLink":"/user/id/978026544"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I enjoyed the conclusion of the Skywalker saga, but it did not capture the magic of the original trilogy and frankly not even the magic of the previous movie.  Was a little flat.  They had developed some characters in the previous movies (e.g. Rose) but did little with them.  Overall it was above average but could have and should have been so much more.","displayName":"Michael P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:21:01.101Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:21:01.101Z","user":{"userId":"214099e1-17b0-422e-b011-37ae9b8d1975","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael P","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It exceeded my expectations. It has all the elements one expects to see in a Star Wars film. I think the films critics are being too harsh. It's a Star Wars story it is not to be taken as serious art. If you are looking for drama watch, \"Marriage Story,\" or \"Little Women.\" Star Wars is fantasy. Go watch it for entertainment's sake not for some profound moral message.","displayName":"Wiley B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:20:36.890Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:20:36.890Z","user":{"userId":"7c8981db-617f-4394-ac6d-c6fa0794e56c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Wiley B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Perfect conclusion to the franchise.
