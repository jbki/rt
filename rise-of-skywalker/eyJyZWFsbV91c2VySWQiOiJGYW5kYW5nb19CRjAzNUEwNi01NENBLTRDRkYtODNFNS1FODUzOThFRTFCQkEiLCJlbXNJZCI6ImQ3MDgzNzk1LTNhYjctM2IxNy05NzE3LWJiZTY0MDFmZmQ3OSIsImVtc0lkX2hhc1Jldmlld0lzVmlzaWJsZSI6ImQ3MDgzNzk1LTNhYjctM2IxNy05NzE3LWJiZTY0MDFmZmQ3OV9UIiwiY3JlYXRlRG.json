SPOILERS BELOW. \n(if u want a quick review the rise of skywalker is a sh*tshow) \n\nSo.. Where to start....\nWhen I walked on to watch this movie I was expecting a disaster, and that's what I got.\nThe plot itself isn't that bad, infact, it was quite interesting... But Disney, oh Disney.. WHY DID YOU HAVE TO RUIN IT?!\n\nSome things in this movie are USESLESS AND Pointless and have no meaning, for example: since when do tie fighters have a hyperdrive, and why when finn gets rescued he jumps on the top of the Falcon.. AND THEN IT GOES VERTICLE. also Disney doesn't know how holocrons work so that's also great. My friend and I had a system called Disney bulls**t. This is when something really dumb and u logical thing happens. We got a total of 136 in the whole movie, while episode 8 got 26.\n\nPlus, Disney doesn't understand lightsabers and how to egnite them, and for some reason now rey can F***ING HEAL PEOPLE NOW?!???!?\n\nalso now when you force push a lightsaber the blade gets all wobbly so that's also great. Plus she can shoot electricity but can't use the force to move some sand.\nAnd finn says he used the force instincts to guide him which is also complete bulls***t.\nThe only good thing is that Ian came back as palatine so that's the only positive. \n\nIn the end, this is a horrible, Disney covered star wars movie!","displayName":"Jeremiah G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:34:17.753Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:34:17.753Z","user":{"userId":"978452876","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeremiah G","accountLink":"/user/id/978452876"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"This movie is trying so hard to satisfy everybody that it ends up not satisfying anybody. It rushes from scene to scene, not allowing time for the emotional beats to sink in. And the ending... Let's just say I expected SW to leave me feeling uplifted, not depressed. Biggest missed opportunity in cinematic history. In conclusion, it ends up insulting not only \"The Last Jedi\", but basically all the eight preceding films.","displayName":"Bree I","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:34:13.264Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:54:32.721Z","user":{"userId":"977098373","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bree I","accountLink":"/user/id/977098373"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The story was fantastic.

It is the biggest pile of steaming dog poo since ... well since The Last Jedi. After seeing this Star Wars is officially dead to me. The worst part is I will never get this time back. The story makes absolutely 0 sense. It is disconnected not only from itself but from Star Wars as a whole. It simply does not know where it wants to go. Rey's character is over powered and simply isn't a likable character. Ugh I could go on and on but then I would be giving this money more time and frankly it already took too much from me.","displayName":"JJ A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:34:00.838Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:34:00.838Z","user":{"userId":"978452934","realm":"RT","displayName":"JJ A","accountLink":"/user/id/978452934"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"With out fans these movies wouldn't even exists. So I think it's great that you end a saga with a thank you to fans by including things they would want to see. I felt it could have been a long movie but I enjoyed all the moments. The musical score was excellent. Of course you can't make everyone happy but thank you JJ and Disney for trying.

This film has moments that will make  you upset because they are absolutely absurd but the ride through was still enjoyable. It feels like two movies crammed into 2 and some change hours at points which makes it feel messy especially in the opening act. Alot of information is thrown at you to undo alot in the last jedi but not enough time is given to make each of these moments grow. This needed to be a 3 and a half hour film for sure. They all did well enough for being written in the corner. The ending needed to be a bit stronger.","displayName":"Sid B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1679366999/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:33:21.982Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:33:32.566Z","user":{"userId":"978452944","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sid B","accountLink":"/user/id/978452944"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"it was almost a bad movie with good parts but then they had to go and do THAT at the end so ðŸ”ª","displayName":"Elysia G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:33:20.465Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:33:44.008Z","user":{"userId":"972596107","realm":"RT","displayName":"Elysia G","accountLink":"/user/id/972596107"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
