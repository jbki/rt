I am a huge star wars fan, and I thought this ending was just amazing. I think they balanced out the action, humor, and serious moments pretty well, even though there are a few unnecessary jokes. The effects are great, the acting is good, and I really enjoyed the plot. There are a lot of cameos in this movie that I really enjoyed like Kylo Ren hearing Vader's voice or Rey hearing all the past jedi's voices like Yoda, Qui-Gon, and Anakin, and the final battle was really epic. The end of the movie is really satisfying too and there are a few great reveals that I don't want to spoil. Overall, the movie is great in almost every aspect, and I think it will make all of the big Star Wars fans grin like a cat the whole way through. This was just an amazing conclusion to a great series.","displayName":"Zach P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T01:16:21.395Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T02:07:02.452Z","user":{"userId":"978097284","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zach P","accountLink":"/user/id/978097284"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"so good, parts had me crying","displayName":"ChefBgob","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T00:47:03.549Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T03:32:58.064Z","user":{"userId":"05491705-036F-45EB-BA69-716ED7A48F61","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"ChefBgob","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"}]}
