So many new questions, and so many old questions left unanswered. The plot was rushed, canon history was ignored and ret-conned, and character arcs years in the making were ruined.

The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi were very promising and fresh in my opinion, but TROS doesn't deliver. It's unimaginative, a rehash of things we've seen before in the original trilogy except they lack its potency and feel forced upon the story. Previously established character's arcs are completely ignored in favour of what felt like last minute decisions that are detrimental not only to the characters and this trilogy's narrative but to the Skywalker Saga as a whole. This sequel didn't have a plan and it shows in its conclusion. The cynicism is strong in this one.","displayName":"Sandrine J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157121163172840/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:11:53.994Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:12:06.342Z","user":{"userId":"977534593","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sandrine J","accountLink":"/user/id/977534593"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"}]}
