There were unnecessary missteps, certainly.  However, considering the messy aftermath of Last Jedi, they did a fine job stitching what was left to them into a coherent and redeemable conclusion.  The story line of Rey and the Skywalkers are brought to a satisfying conclusion.","displayName":"Ellie E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100003917747808/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:34:48.164Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:34:54.068Z","user":{"userId":"952756896","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ellie E","accountLink":"/user/id/952756896"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Not without its flaws, but felt most faithful to the serials that Star Wars took so much influence from at its roots.

Every time they say a movie sucks, I go see it in the theater and it's great! Ummm, what am I missing here? As for TROS, the second half of this movie is so exciting that I was able to overlook it's convoluted and schizophrenic start. This is everything I hoped for in a Star Wars flick.","displayName":"Dave G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10218605788609132/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:32:11.429Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:04:32.218Z","user":{"userId":"978450749","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dave G","accountLink":"/user/id/978450749"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"A sloppy ending with no respect for the characters that made the saga great","displayName":"Wesley S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10218743203309050/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:28:15.473Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T14:05:20.903Z","user":{"userId":"977817104","realm":"RT","displayName":"Wesley S","accountLink":"/user/id/977817104"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"If you've stuck with the series this far, then you owe it to yourself to see this satisfying conclusion.","displayName":"Andrew C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:27:04.893Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:27:04.893Z","user":{"userId":"33c527a9-a993-4127-a5a2-14de3523b536","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Andrew C","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Pleasantly surprised at the execution of this film as a stand alone installment, and the ending to a sequel trilogy, and 9 story saga.  The spoilers/leaks and rumors leading up to this film most likely sounded worse without the context of how the story was presented.  A bit too fast paced at times, visually stunning, and the best film this installment could be, given the long road of story evolution.   Hopefully lessons were learned along the way for Disney - and future writers/directors are given more time to craft solid story telling.  Characters finally started having some depth to them.  \"Hopefully this will start to make things right in the galaxy\".","displayName":"John G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/571476964/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:26:54.948Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:26:59.106Z","user":{"userId":"911632345","realm":"RT","displayName":"John G","accountLink":"/user/id/911632345"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
