It could have been better but JJ had to deal with the aftermath of Rian destroying most of the plot and characters he started building in force awakens.  This movie had no true villain over the developed over the last 2 movies - he had to bring in - well you know which seemed weak and far fetched let alone the massive fleet.  I never viewed Kylo as a villain in line of other villains - not even close (remember Darth Vader appearing in Rogue at the end - that was a villain).    The other thing this trilogy never had good climactic battles.  Darth Maul vs Obi / Qui Gonn, Yoda vs Dooku, Yoda vs Emperor, Anakin vs Obi - nothing even remotely close or spine tingling.  In the end probably bad that they had 2 directors doing things - probably would have been better to have JJ do the entire thing for ONE vision. (bad K Kennedy for letting that occur).  Disney is becoming the EA of the movie world it seems.","displayName":"Gary H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:10:13.718Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:15:54.073Z","user":{"userId":"976480492","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gary H","accountLink":"/user/id/976480492"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"}]}
