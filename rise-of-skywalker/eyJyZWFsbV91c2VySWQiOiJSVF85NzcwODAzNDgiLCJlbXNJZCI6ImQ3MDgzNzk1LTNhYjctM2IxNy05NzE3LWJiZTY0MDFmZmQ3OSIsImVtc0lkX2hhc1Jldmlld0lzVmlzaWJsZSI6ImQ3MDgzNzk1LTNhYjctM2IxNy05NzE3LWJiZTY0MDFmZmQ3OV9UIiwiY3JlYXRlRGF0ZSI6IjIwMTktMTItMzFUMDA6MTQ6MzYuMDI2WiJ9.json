The visuals were stunning. The preference for puppetry over CGI was also wonderful  However, I have nothing but dislike for the ship battles - again - since they made no sense. Shields? What shields? Power to fly? Who needs it? A handful of 50 year old ships against more destroyers than you can shake a stick at? Why not?.. it was just ridiculous. \n\nAlso - why would A 10 year old boy build a translation robot and A) even know what Sith was and B) Stop it from being able to translate it?","displayName":"Gareth Y","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10153917449715940/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T00:08:57.836Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T00:09:16.028Z","user":{"userId":"975799901","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gareth Y","accountLink":"/user/id/975799901"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"}]}
