I will say that after the last debacle of a Star Wars movie, I actually refused to watch any Star Wars related movies or series, or anything else for that matter related to Star Wars. I felt like the last movie was offensive to what  Star Wars was all about and the key characters.  This movie brought back the series and the feeling of what Star Wars is all about. Hats off to JJAbrams for figuring it out, and even finding a way to make some coherent sense of the last disaster of a movie. I give this movie the full five stars because it had a really terrible act to follow – in my opinion, the last Jedi was probably the worst Star Wars movie of all time, and just a terrible movie in general – And somehow this movie was able to build on that. The pacing, the character development, the themes that ran through this, Everything was just right. Was the movie completely perfect? No, but it had to make sense of all the stuff that happened in the last disaster. And it did that. And most importantly, it felt like a Star Wars movie. But, it did not feel like a redo of a prior Star Wars movie, which was my big problem with the force awakens. This movie has its own rhythm and its own plot twists, so I give it the full five stars and highly recommend that everyone watch it, particularly disenchanted Star Wars fans like myself, who now feel like they are back with the franchise.\n\nI do want to add one more thing. I am very disappointed with the critic reviews of this movie. And I was extremely disappointed with the critic reviews of the last Jedi, which were overwhelmingly positive, even though the last Jedi was such a terrible movie. It really makes me question the value of critics, if they cannot recognize a great movie and a bad movie when they see one. I don't know what happens to people when they become movie critics, but I am absolutely shocked that they don't realize that this is a great movie, and that they didn't realize that the last movie was terrible.To be perfectly candid, I had boycotted all Star Wars Movies after the last movie, but one of the reasons that I decided to give this one a try is because the audience reviews were overwhelmingly positive and the critic reviews were negative. Given how wrong critics tend to be, that was definitely the right choice. That and I've got a good friend who had already seen the movie and he wanted to watch it with me again.  Critics, please get your act together! Know your audience!  It is really embarrassing for you critics to see how little you understand about what makes Star Wars such a special franchise. Thank God for JJ Abrams to be able to see through all of your crap.","displayName":"Neeraj A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-22T08:46:25.607Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:05:47.739Z","user":{"userId":"898977869","realm":"RT","displayName":"Neeraj A","accountLink":"/user/id/898977869"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"}]}
