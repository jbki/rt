While in the theatre, it's fantastic, but after you come out and the excitement wears off, you are left with a lot of questions. It was visually stunning and overall entertaining, but there were many plot points left open and things unanswered. It was decent enough though. If you are okay with not needing to know everything, I would recommend it.","displayName":"Sarah C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T02:35:33.745Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T02:36:47.841Z","user":{"userId":"978453078","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sarah C","accountLink":"/user/id/978453078"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Theyve been pretty bad, but this one was pretty good.","displayName":"Thomas","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T02:34:58.126Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T02:34:58.126Z","user":{"userId":"ca93d781-9d29-42e9-af6f-289ee0803491","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Thomas","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A great end to the Star Wars saga","displayName":"Christine","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T02:34:05.225Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T02:34:05.225Z","user":{"userId":"3a9d046e-f5db-42cd-90e5-726527b9f495","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Christine","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"meh. underwhelming ending to what was meant to be the grand finale","displayName":"Ernie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T02:33:11.767Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T02:33:11.767Z","user":{"userId":"DD210C15-0708-424A-B52B-DC8B51FCE393","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ernie","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it.
