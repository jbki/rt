Star Wars 9 was always going to be an easy cheap shot for critics. But just look at the audience score, thats  all you need to know.  8 was weird and a mess, it was 3hr chase scene that destroyed the character of Luke Skywalker. Hopefully one day 8 will be re-edited into something that properly fits into this Star Wars trilogy.","displayName":"Marc H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100005460120587/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T04:34:52.294Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T04:35:14.063Z","user":{"userId":"951846237","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marc H","accountLink":"/user/id/951846237"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"}]}
