Too much trying to please the fans with lack of plan and storytelling that did not flow well to this finally. This move was visually nice yet felt very convoluted especially in the beginning. Could have done much better with the pieces and stories set up from the force awakens. Definitely not a must watch as episodes 3, 4, 5, & 6 will be the repeat must sees yet with this finale they will look and feel meaningless and empty.","displayName":"Luis","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T20:15:22.936Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T20:15:22.936Z","user":{"userId":"4BBC14AC-86FD-4813-8D90-91CF6153C709","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Luis","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I liked the thought that working together the seemingly impossible can be done.","displayName":"Geary Titus","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T20:14:11.359Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T20:14:11.359Z","user":{"userId":"c5b32b50-872c-4efe-ab21-45eb3d05a51b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Geary Titus","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Uneasy mix of all the expected Star Wars tropes though Unnecessarily maudlin.
