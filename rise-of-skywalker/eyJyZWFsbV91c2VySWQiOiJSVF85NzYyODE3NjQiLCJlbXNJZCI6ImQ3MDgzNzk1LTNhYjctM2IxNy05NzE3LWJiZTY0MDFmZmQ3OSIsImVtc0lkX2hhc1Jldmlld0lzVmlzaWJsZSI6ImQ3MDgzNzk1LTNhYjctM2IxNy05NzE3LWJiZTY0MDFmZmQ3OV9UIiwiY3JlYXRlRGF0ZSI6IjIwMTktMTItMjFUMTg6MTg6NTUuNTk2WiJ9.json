Now in my 40’s I and happy to see the conclusion to a beloved childhood story.  Love this movie even without Carry Fisher throughout the whole movie.  It was emotional seeing her on screen one last time.  She’s the most confident and knowledgeable Disney princesses of all time!  Princess Leah, I will follow you into any battle.  Disney is golden.  You can can’t go wrong with Disney.","displayName":"NoWay NoHow","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:18:41.306Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:18:41.306Z","user":{"userId":"C9EEDD03-116B-497E-A96A-4F337C353DF1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"NoWay NoHow","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Fun but messy.

There are no identity politics, and if they are, are subtle. Reverses or gives the middle finger to a bunch of idiotic things done by The Last Jedi, but feels sometimes restrained by it as well. In summarize, a decent closure for the Disney trilogy.","displayName":"pablo c","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:18:31.502Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:18:38.825Z","user":{"userId":"814469685","realm":"RT","displayName":"pablo c","accountLink":"/user/id/814469685"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved the entire movie.
