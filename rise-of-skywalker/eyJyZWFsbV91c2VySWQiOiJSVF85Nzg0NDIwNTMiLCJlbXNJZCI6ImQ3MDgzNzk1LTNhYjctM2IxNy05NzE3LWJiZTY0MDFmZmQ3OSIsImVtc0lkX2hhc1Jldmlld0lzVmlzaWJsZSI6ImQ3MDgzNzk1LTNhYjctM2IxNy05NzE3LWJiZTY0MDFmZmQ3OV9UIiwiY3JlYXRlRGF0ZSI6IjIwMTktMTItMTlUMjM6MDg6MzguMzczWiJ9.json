So I'll reiterate. SPOILERS AHEAD!\n\nI enjoyed this movie a lot!\nGood points:\n- Nice resolution to the angst between Rey and Kylo Ren/Ben.\n- Fitting and heartfelt send-off for our Princess.\n- Rey twist, saw this coming, just not in this way!\n- Palps is back and I loved his part, plus a bit of extra Sith lore, interesting. Music reminded me of the Knights of the Old Republic video game.\n- D-O is cute!\n- All the cameos, loved it. Wallowed in nostalgia\n- Some characters had their backgrounds fleshed out a bit more, was nice! \n\nBad points:\n- Super fast paced. It felt like a bombardment of information and emotion. Like being being in a constant roller coaster ride, without the slow bits. Some things could have done with a bit of breathing room.\n\nThat's it, enjoyed it, will see it again in theaters!","displayName":"Sara D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1624717372/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:08:16.628Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:09:30.363Z","user":{"userId":"870090687","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sara D","accountLink":"/user/id/870090687"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"At the end of the day it is a fun movie to watch and the main characters are easy to connect with. The visuals are (mostly) great, the score is good, and the actors were good. \n\nI will admit it seemed like JJ was trying to tell 2 stories in one movie to make up for TLJ, creating a movie that tries and (sort of) fails to please everyone, but it is a good enough send-off to a trilogy that should have had an outline before they filmed it. Don't try and make sense of everything otherwise you'll just end up hating it.","displayName":"Drew D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1386306164/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:08:16.258Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:08:19.556Z","user":{"userId":"910100460","realm":"RT","displayName":"Drew D","accountLink":"/user/id/910100460"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love what JJ has done with the Star Wars sequel thrilogy, it is very special, you can tell he is a huge fan of the saga. I don't think this movie doesn't have any flaws, but it is a marvelous way to end the Skywalker saga. I cried, I got excited, I was anxious, it felt so much like a true Star Wars movie, and I appreciate that a lot. If you think too much about it,  you may want to remove or add some things, but that is not what a Star Wars movie is about. This movie was a tremendous and unforgetable expierience that I will always keep in my heart, I am absolutely proud of Episode IX and I'm sure that as the years go by, people will have a better perception of this masterpiece.
