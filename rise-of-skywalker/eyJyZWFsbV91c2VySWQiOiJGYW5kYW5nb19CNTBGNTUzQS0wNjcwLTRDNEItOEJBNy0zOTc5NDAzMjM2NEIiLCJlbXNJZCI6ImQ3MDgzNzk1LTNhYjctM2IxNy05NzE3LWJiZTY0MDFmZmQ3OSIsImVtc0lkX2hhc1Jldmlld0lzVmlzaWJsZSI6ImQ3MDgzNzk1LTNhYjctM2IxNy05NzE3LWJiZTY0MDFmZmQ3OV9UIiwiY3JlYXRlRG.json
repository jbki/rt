Entertaining in a way you'll forget by next year. Story is a mess and has many missed opportunities. There is no emotional attachment to Rey after two movies, and so her scenes lack punch. Daisy Ridley mails in her performances when it comes to the physical acting. The whole thing has it moments, but mostly it falls short.","displayName":"John H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T18:48:43.156Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T18:48:43.156Z","user":{"userId":"978466024","realm":"RT","displayName":"John H","accountLink":"/user/id/978466024"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It stated off rather choppy and disjointed and I feared the worst, but I was pleasantly surprised by the action packed ending.
