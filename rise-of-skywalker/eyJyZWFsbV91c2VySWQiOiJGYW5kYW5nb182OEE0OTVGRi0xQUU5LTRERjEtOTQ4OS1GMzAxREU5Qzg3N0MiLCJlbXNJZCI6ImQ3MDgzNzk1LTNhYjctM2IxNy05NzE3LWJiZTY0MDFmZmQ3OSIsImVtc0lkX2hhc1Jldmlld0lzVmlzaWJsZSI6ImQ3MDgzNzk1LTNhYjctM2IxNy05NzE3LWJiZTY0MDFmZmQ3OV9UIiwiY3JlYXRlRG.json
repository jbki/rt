Resurrection of Palpatine was done years before epsiode IX. The END of the Skywalker Saga of the spit in the face of everything that was done previously, devaluing the story of Anakin Skywalker and lessong that were taught by it for generations of people all over the world. The pace of the movie feels like a speedrun of an action adventure game set to easy difficulty. The story is a chimera of the plots of multiple Expanded Universe titles like Dark Empire comics, Dark Forces & Force Unleashed game series and The Return of the Jedi movie, delivered via Disney storytelling style of lighthearted fairy tale with guarantied happy end. Complete 180 turn from The Last Jedi.","displayName":"Vladislaf C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/753433528487849/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T08:37:51.722Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T08:38:06.612Z","user":{"userId":"978473492","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vladislaf C","accountLink":"/user/id/978473492"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Não se deixem enganar por críticas ranzinzas de fanáticos que se acham donos da franquia e que acham que tudo deve ser como eles desejam. O filme é excelente e traz um bom desfecho para a nova trilogia. Não é isento de furos, como o próprio retorno de Palpatine que poderia ter sido melhor explorado em outros filmes. Para mim, vai marcar época como um dos melhores Star Wars já feitos.","displayName":"Joo V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1939170432779310/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T08:36:50.597Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T08:36:50.597Z","user":{"userId":"976941595","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joo V","accountLink":"/user/id/976941595"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome movie.
