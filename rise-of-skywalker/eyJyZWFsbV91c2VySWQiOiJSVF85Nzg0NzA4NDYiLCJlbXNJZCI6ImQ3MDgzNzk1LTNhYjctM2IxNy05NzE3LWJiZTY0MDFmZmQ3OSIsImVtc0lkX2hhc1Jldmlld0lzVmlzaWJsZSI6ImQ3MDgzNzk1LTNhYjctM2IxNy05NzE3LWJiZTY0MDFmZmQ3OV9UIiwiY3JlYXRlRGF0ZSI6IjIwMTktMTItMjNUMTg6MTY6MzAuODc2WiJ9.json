No one who's a fan of Star Wars possibly could.  It stank.  It isn't Star Wars.  Destroys the legacy of every character.  Has more plot holes than plot.  Daisy Ridley can not act.  And the main villain was killed by Anakin Skywalker 36 years ago.  You can't just \"bring him back\" anymore than Rei can \"decide\" she wants to identify as a Skywalker now.  Horrible.  Disney & Hollywood destroy yet another classic American story.","displayName":"Traci N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1286752384763835/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:14:27.474Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:14:27.474Z","user":{"userId":"978470835","realm":"RT","displayName":"Traci N","accountLink":"/user/id/978470835"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Well done, especially considering the previous installment.","displayName":"Emmit S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:14:19.460Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:14:19.460Z","user":{"userId":"7FCE95D5-0DE0-4CB3-A01D-ED0F8182512D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Emmit S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I already rated and raved about how this movie has somehow done the impossible by driving me away from Star Wars permanently, but it should be said that Adam and Daisy were phenomenal â€” the whole cast was, but they were incredible.
