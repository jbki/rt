He is an excellent director. This movie had moments of AWE. And it took a lot away from me also. But in my final words, I'll say he had to end this Skywalker narrative. And he did. No way to continue this side of the Starwars story. I wish Luke could have been allowed in this movie and sacrificed himself in the last third of this movie. You'll see where I would have let him pass into the force. Anyhow if your 40 or older STARWARS IS EITHER LUKE, VADER, or the FORCE. TIME TO MOVE ON TO THE OLD REPUBLIC NOW.","displayName":"Joseph E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10214512727364932/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T16:21:00.314Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T16:21:14.492Z","user":{"userId":"977460388","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph E","accountLink":"/user/id/977460388"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great ending to this epic Saga.
