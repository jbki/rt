I think it was way better than The Last Jedi. I understood what JJ abrams was trying to do. It is like what if Carrie Fisher was alive? would the story would have changed or be the same? My audience was filled to the max. My audience there was claps, and gasps, but the biggest claps and Woooo was that moment (and i will not say what moment), I know why Rey did what she did at the end hence that Titanic moment. It makes sense to me. But it is sad about that something is gone sort of speak and I will not say. I think questions that we all had got answered. I did cry. So yeah thats it.

I'm a huge Star Wars fan, but this movie had no character development, no hero's arc, and it made no sense.
