Not as pointless and uneven as the Last Jedi but Rise can be accused of that as well. You can’t please everyone but overall I liked it and will probably catch it one more time for details I missed. Predicable yes, Fan Service sure ( why not) will you ever find true balance, between the two concepts,maybe not! That’s for Disney to figure out with Kevin Fiegi ( i am sure I spelled that wrong).
