There is too much crammed into the movie and there is not a perfect rationale to everything we see, but this is a beautiful end to an epic saga. RoJ is lovely and in 1983, I can see why people were satisfied, but when FA happened and we had a continuation of the universe and questions posed, there was a lot to do and unfortunately LJ wasted a lot of space (pardon the pun) in our storytelling. What LJ did do CORRECT was truly emphasize the connections that each of the \"force users\" hold with each other and the imperfect behavior that can happen even with the best of intentions. This movie really does that best that it can to come full circle to the story being told from Episode 1 through 9. Event the stand-alone movies have a purpose in this world. Think for yourself and come see this movie. You won't be sorry and though you will be frustrated...you don't have to despair. Critics need to reevaluate WHAT they are critiquing now and the merits that they hold.","displayName":"Sara E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T18:22:03.170Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T18:22:12.078Z","user":{"userId":"783101709","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sara E","accountLink":"/user/id/783101709"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"After the first 30 minutes or so it turned into my favorite star wars movie of all time.","displayName":"Justin W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T18:22:00.512Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T18:22:05.915Z","user":{"userId":"978451857","realm":"RT","displayName":"Justin W","accountLink":"/user/id/978451857"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing wrap-up to the trilogy.
