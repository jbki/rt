Rose didn't get her due in this movie. Also there are many things missing in the movie like how Palpatine came back from the \"dead\", what was Landro doing between then & now, & many other things missing in the movie, however, this movie is 142 minute long & I don't think they could put everything to all in that time & have a good movie.\nNothingtheless, this great movie in the Star Wars series.","displayName":"Frank C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:05:45.025Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:05:45.025Z","user":{"userId":"beb507f6-412f-4abb-b363-8452a79194aa","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Frank C","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Terrible movie.

We're Star Wars nuts, mind you, but we loved that the action began immediately and didn't let up for 2 hours, and the ending put a neat bow on top of the 9-episode saga in a most satisfying way. Enjoyed the story line thoroughly and the surprises were pleasant ones. We can't wait for the home edition on DVD to be released to add to our collection.","displayName":"SLINKYDAVE","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:04:44.493Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:04:44.493Z","user":{"userId":"a7125623-5666-45e3-97e5-d19826c151cb","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"SLINKYDAVE","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Overall, it was only okay. There were definitely a lot of loose ends to tie up and the fact that it tied up most of them (not all) is a big accomplishment. The film suffers from pacing issues and a few gaping plot holes if the story ties back to other Star Wars stories. I found most characters relatively static except for Kylo and Rey. Palpatine seems forced and a little unnecessary. I think he should have been introduced earlier in the trilogy.","displayName":"Cole D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:04:37.562Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:04:37.562Z","user":{"userId":"FFF95E9A-B7D8-4EFA-AE41-50535FF65EE2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Cole D","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Despite the weird unexplained beginning, I saw a great movie, with good Star Wars style ideas, new interesting settings and ceatures, expressive actors (Kylo Ren above the others, impressive interpretation) that helped to higher the pathos minute after minute.
