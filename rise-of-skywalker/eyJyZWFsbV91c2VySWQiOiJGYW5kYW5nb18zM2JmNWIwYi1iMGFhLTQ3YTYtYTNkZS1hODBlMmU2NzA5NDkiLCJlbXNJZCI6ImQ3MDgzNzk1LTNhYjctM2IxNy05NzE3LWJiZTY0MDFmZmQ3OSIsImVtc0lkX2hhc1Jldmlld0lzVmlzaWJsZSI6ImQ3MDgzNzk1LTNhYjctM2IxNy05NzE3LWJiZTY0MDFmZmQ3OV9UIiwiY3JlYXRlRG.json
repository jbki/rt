Unfortunately, the damage from former director Last Jedi combined with the New Hope rewrite that was Abram's first film in the series proves too great for us to actually care much for most of the new characters introduced in this trilogy. As far as endings to a long saga go, I can say it wasn't as disappointing as Game of Thrones. However, they did sideline Rose, the second worst character of the Star Wars franchise (looking at you Jar Jar), so I give it a merciful 2 stars.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T04:41:36.373Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T04:41:36.373Z","user":{"userId":"953710577","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/953710577"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 03, 2020"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I thought daisy Ridley and Kylo ren really carries the show.
