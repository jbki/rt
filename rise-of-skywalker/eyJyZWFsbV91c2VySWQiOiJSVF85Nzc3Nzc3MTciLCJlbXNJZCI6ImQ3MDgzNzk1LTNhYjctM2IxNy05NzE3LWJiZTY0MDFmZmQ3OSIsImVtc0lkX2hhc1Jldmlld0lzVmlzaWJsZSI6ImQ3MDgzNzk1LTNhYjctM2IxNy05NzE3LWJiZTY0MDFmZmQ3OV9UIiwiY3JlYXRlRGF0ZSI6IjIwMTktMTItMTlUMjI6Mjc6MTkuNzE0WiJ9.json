Altogether it closes off the Skywalker saga in a perfect way. Thoroughly enjoyable film! The action is fantastic. The cgi and the scenery are beautiful. And the emotional beats hit the spot in the right way.

If you're a adult though and have any concept of a plot in a movie then this is terrible. I love Star Wars but this confirms Disney has no idea what to do, they had no game plan going into this series. It's a shame.
