The story fills the gaps of Rey's Background, Snoke's Origins, and The First Orders True Intent. The final installment in the Skywalker Saga has its funny, sad, and tragic moments. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I applaud Ian McDiarmid on his performance as Emperor Palpatine, I haven't been this obsessed with a Star Wars film since 2005's Revenge of the Sith!","displayName":"Alexander E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:01:12.820Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:01:17.144Z","user":{"userId":"977949910","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alexander E","accountLink":"/user/id/977949910"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"When I watched this movie it didnt feel like I was watching a Star Wars movie. I enjoyed some scenes but it felt rushed. The movie tries to answer all the questions that are better left to the imagination of the viewer like older Star Wars movies. They tried to fill to many holes and explain too much. Overall I can say it was just cool to watch. The special effects carry the movies plot. Great CGI and cinematography but the plot wasnt what I wanted for a Star Wars film.","displayName":"Jordan Johnson","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:01:11.299Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:01:11.299Z","user":{"userId":"f756ecd2-a626-4930-883b-cfc7a9b58055","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jordan Johnson","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Contradicts everything the original six movies built","displayName":"Matthew A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2735580393170595/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:00:53.915Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:00:59.771Z","user":{"userId":"978452717","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew A","accountLink":"/user/id/978452717"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Ok movie!
