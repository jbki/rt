I’ll admit that I cried a lot, the film had really great moments and some moments I felt could had more weight. Be ready because it was a little fast paced, there were a lot of scenes that happened too quickly imo that I felt could have been savored if it were slowed down. The final confrontation again happened a little too fast but overall I felt good.","displayName":"davijjn94","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T22:25:20.414Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T22:25:20.414Z","user":{"userId":"E67CF7AE-3AD7-4D8D-9B5C-F3E5566C9E88","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"davijjn94","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I was so glad with how they fixed the problems created by The Last Jedi.

Not epic but great. Fixed the mess up of the last Jedi. Very longtime fan of the Star Wars for 30+ years. Only drawback is they spent a lot of time fixing the last Jedi that it seems like it was rushed. No dead time action front to back. Sidious was a great piece. Force heal and Drain like the video games mass powers were used. Sorry trying not to spoil. Great movie would have been a great trilogy if number 2 was in line with this.","displayName":"brian","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T22:25:17.888Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T22:25:17.888Z","user":{"userId":"DA7498DD-9189-49AF-9729-1238195BD62E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"brian","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I thought the movie was great, there did appear to be some loose ends that needed to be addressed. this movie did that. nothing let me down about this movie.
