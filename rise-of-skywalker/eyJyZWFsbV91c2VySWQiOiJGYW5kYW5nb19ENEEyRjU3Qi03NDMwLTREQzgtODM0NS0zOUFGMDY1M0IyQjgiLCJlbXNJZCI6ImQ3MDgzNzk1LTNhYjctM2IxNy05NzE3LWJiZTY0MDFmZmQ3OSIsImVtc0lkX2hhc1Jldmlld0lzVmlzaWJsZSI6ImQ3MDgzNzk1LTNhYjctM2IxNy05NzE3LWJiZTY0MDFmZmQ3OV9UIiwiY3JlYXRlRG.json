The Rise of Skywalker is a hollow movie with bad writing and whole scenes and characters that seem to have come out of a board room, designed to please every shareholder and sell merchandise. It thinks we won't ask questions, since it blasts us with fast-paced scenes in the face like a hose. As a Star Wars movie, it is disrespectful to the achievements of the prior films. Anakin's bringing balance to the force didn't matter anymore. The Last Jedi apparently didn't happen. Characters that were introduced with promise end up doing nothing. I grew up with Star Wars, so this is personal. This movie was an embarrassment.","displayName":"Kevin W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1301580797/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T07:49:32.416Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T16:01:36.609Z","user":{"userId":"868749058","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kevin W","accountLink":"/user/id/868749058"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"21h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"This movie is overrated.

The script is horribleâ€” awful dialogue and plotting. The Voldermort (Palpatine) is back story doesn't work. And where's the humor?? The best parts of the early Star Wars episodes were the humor & character development along with the tension between Hans, Lea, Luke, R2D2, C3PO and Chewy. The new episodes are all serious and no fun. The Rise of Skywalker is possibly worse than any prior Star Wars \"episode.\" It ends a legendary franchise with a thud.","displayName":"Desiree D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1381411598/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T07:17:02.234Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T07:17:23.788Z","user":{"userId":"922860524","realm":"RT","displayName":"Desiree D","accountLink":"/user/id/922860524"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"21h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It was good movie overall.
