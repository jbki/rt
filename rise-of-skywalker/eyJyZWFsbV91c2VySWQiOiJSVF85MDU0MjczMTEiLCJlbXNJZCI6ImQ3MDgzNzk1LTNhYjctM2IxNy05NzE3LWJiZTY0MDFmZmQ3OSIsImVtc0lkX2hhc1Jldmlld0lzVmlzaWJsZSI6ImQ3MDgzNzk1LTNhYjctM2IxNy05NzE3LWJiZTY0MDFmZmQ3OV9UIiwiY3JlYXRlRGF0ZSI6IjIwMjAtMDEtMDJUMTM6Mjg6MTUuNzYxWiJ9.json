Could it be fatigue from how disappointing Last Jedi was for me or this installments lack of creativity and storytelling? Found myself too many times shaking my head thinking how they \"borrowed\" this scene or that one from the original. I wanted to enjoy this movie but in the end the story felt rushed, unresolved, and unsatisfying for me.","displayName":"Gerald B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/643259305/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T13:24:36.118Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T13:26:24.407Z","user":{"userId":"919249892","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gerald B","accountLink":"/user/id/919249892"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Liked movie very much.

This movie is not that bad it is way better than last Jedi it has a decent story. Its not perfect and yes Rei is still a stupid character but its still a good movie.
