The ultimate blame is on Disney for not having a 3 movie story outline and Rian Johnson making that abundantly clear with his \"artistic\" choices grinding the trilogy to a halt. This movie had no where to go. It stayed at break neck pace all the way through trying to invent a new trilogy in an attempt to play catch up which is why it feels like 2 movies in one. It did feel like the Star Wars universe however and while very entertaining visually, it's not a good movie. I don't hate it like the Last Jedi. The trilogy was over before this movie came out. JJ did his best to cobble something together to numb your mind for 2.5 hours, but ultimately this trilogy has no soul. I was never given a reason, that made sense, to care about these characters.","displayName":"Lee B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/500454461/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T12:21:20.762Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T14:24:16.628Z","user":{"userId":"948885504","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lee B","accountLink":"/user/id/948885504"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"loved it. not a hard core fan but am deep enough to appreciate everything in this film.","displayName":"Skye H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T09:32:23.282Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T18:44:01.230Z","user":{"userId":"13D3D875-7265-414C-9563-6B95D2006297","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Skye H","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a lot better than expected.
