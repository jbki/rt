A genuine story is no longer possible in a Star Wars Universe. I don't think anyone has ever understood what made the original work, including Lucas. Everyone should see this movie, because it's part of the whole mess, but also, it barely qualifies as a movie. When critics say \"it's mostly exposition,\" here's a example of what they mean: this movie establishes stakes almost exclusively by having characters constantly point out that the next bit of incomprehensible plot must happen or everything will have been for nothing.","displayName":"craig  c","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T19:24:29.621Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:26:59.704Z","user":{"userId":"978452386","realm":"RT","displayName":"craig  c","accountLink":"/user/id/978452386"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Edited my original review from 3 stars to 2 stars. After spending time thinking about the movie, there is just too many plot holes and stupid things that happen. I reaped hated The Last Jedi, but now I'm starting to think TLJ was the better made movie between these two. \n\nOriginal Review:\nHardly a satisfying conclusion of the Skywalker/Star Wars Saga, but it is a conclusion..... \n\nActually is was very surprising how much was concluded in this movie.  There is actually nowhere to go from this point forward. It seems if Disney is going to make more Star Wars movies, it will have to be like Rogue One or The Mandalorian. Just filling in time gaps between the 9 episodes. \n\nThe pacing of this movie is very fast and plot development is very convenient. All the characters have deep connections with each other, all which apparently have developed off screen.\n\nBetter than the Last Jedi, but not by much.","displayName":"Heath V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T19:21:49.906Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T21:42:23.738Z","user":{"userId":"969058531","realm":"RT","displayName":"Heath V","accountLink":"/user/id/969058531"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I ship this!
