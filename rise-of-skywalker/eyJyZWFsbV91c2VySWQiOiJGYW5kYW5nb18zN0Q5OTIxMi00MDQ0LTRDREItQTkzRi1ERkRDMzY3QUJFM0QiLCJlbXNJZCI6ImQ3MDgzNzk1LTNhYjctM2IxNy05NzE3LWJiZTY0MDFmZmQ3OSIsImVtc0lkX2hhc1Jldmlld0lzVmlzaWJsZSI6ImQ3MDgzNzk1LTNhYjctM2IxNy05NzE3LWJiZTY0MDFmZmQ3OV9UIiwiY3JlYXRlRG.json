The first 2 films failed to make me care about Rey's parents or any other \"mystery\". But this film at least had some good answers to questions I didn't care about. But all the heartless action was exhausting. Too many new characters when we should be celebrating the ones this trilogy is supposed to be about. What is this trilogy about? If you think about it, there's not a good answer (aside from copying the 1st trilogy)... Love you, Star Wars. Please end.","displayName":"Tom W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/502297866/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T07:35:12.294Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T18:23:00.809Z","user":{"userId":"877064577","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tom W","accountLink":"/user/id/877064577"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A great ending to the saga.
