It was very entertaining and fast paced but the \"Star Wars\" heart and soul was missing for sure. Much better than the prequels but not as good as the original trilogy.

But if you watched any of the previous films, you'll notice that several character arcs were thrown in the trash bin. Care about Fin or Rose? Forget about 'em. R2D2, irrelevant.  But, if for no other reason, watch this movie to see Babu Frik.  He is adorable.  He is the one who truly brings balance to the force.","displayName":"George M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/182530722197820/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T16:45:43.072Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T16:45:49.461Z","user":{"userId":"975612384","realm":"RT","displayName":"George M","accountLink":"/user/id/975612384"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"An imperfectly made film, but when it needs to work, it works very well. many breathtaking moments, third act is very solid.
