Great action, special effects, story, and tying-up loose ends. I know the story didn't make everyone happy, but it settled enough plot lines to satisfy me, even though some were a bit of a stretch. A multi-generational saga, which has lasted most of my adult like, has finally ended. Time to move on.","displayName":"Richard P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T06:08:46.460Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T06:08:46.460Z","user":{"userId":"9525f31a-6902-49cf-b1fc-1bbbac7c8fab","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Richard P","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A solid ending for the Star Wars saga.

Moviegoers still looking to blame Rian Johnson for deconstructing their favorite movie mythology should really look to JJ Abrams here for the blame - this story constantly trips over itself trying to reference  scenes and imagery you've seen before, without saying anything new or of substance. This was a really bad movie.","displayName":"A A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T06:08:09.821Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T06:08:16.207Z","user":{"userId":"978397911","realm":"RT","displayName":"A A","accountLink":"/user/id/978397911"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely one of the best Star Wars movies I've ever seen and a great finish to a chapter by Disney.
