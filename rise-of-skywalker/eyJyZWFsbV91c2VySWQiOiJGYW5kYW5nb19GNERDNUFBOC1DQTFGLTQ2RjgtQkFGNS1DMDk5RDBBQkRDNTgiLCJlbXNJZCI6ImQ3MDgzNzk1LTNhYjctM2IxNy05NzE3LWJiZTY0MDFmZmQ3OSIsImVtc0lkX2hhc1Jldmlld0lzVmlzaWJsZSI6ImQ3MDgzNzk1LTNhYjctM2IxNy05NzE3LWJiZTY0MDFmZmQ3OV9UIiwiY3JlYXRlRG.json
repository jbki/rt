It picks up the pieces that The Last Jedi left flapping in the wind, tying them together to a satisfying end. I was engaged during the whole film too. In a lot of recent star wars films there have been scenes that seem to drag on too long, or action sequences that feel very predictable. There were star wars tropes here, but they were used sparingly and I was surprised a few times. This movie makes me like the new trilogy a lot more, planning to see it again.","displayName":"Andrew S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1241550740/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T12:52:27.143Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T12:52:27.143Z","user":{"userId":"918561279","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew S","accountLink":"/user/id/918561279"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"16h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Space ghosts, space ghosts and more space ghost.  Could have been better, even with space ghosts rescuing them over and over again could not help them.  It had its moments, but ugh.

It doesn't have anything really offensive. None of the acting feels off. The plot isn't too ridiculous for a Star Wars movie. But it doesn't really have any ideas or intellectual stimulation and it takes zero risks. As something to pass the time, it was meh. If it wasn't a Star Wars movie, I'd likely forget I even saw it.","displayName":"Hunter O","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1115883058/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T12:50:48.249Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T12:50:52.909Z","user":{"userId":"967614847","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hunter O","accountLink":"/user/id/967614847"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"16h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"I don't think JJ is a good match for the Star Wars franchise. He doesn't do well with plot, letting you breath, giving meaning to what s going on or allowing you to feel.
