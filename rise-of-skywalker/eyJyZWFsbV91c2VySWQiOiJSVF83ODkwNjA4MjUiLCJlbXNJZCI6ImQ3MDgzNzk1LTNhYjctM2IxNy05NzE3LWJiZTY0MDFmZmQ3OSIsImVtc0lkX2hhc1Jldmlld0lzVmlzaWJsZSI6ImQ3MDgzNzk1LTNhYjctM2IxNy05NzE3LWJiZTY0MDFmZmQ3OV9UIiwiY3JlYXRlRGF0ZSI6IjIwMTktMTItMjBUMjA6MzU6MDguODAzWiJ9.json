It feels like he pretended TLJ didn't happen and squeezed two movies into The Rise of Skywalker.

I didn't like the idea of the Emperor coming back.  It undid plot points from previous movies, especially The Last Jedi in an attempt to placate haters.  The plot was convoluted and unexplained.  There was almost no growth in any of the characters except one.  But to be fair it had some great scenes at times.","displayName":"Rico M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:34:59.492Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:57:21.170Z","user":{"userId":"902856333","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rico M","accountLink":"/user/id/902856333"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Don’t listen to the blow hard reviewers, this was a great Star Wars movie.  JJ Abrams brought non-stop action along with all the emotions that make a movie fulfilling. The movie brought excitement, nostalgia, sadness, joy, darkness, and even some legends material for the Star Wars base. Rian Johnson was playing checkers with the Last Jedi while JJ played chess with the Rise of Skywalker!!!!","displayName":"Timothy L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:34:53.927Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:34:53.927Z","user":{"userId":"347292F6-0496-407A-881F-B5C657E70727","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Timothy L","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I feel like how I should feel after seeing a Star Wars movie.
