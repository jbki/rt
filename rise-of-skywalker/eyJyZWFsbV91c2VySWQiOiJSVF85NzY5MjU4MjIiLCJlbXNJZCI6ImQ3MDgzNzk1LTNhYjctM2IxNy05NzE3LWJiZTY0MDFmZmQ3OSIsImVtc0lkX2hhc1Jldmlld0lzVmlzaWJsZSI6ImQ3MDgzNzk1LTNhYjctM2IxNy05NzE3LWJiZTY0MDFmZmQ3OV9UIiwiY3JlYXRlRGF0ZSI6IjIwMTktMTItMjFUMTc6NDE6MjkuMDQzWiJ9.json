This film cowers to fanboys who were made \"Last Jedi\" didn't go according to their fan fiction. This film pretends its the last of the \"Skywalker saga\", but its just McGuffins and side quests and pointless new characters when a real ending would be celebrating the ones we know. This film sours the new trilogy to the point of wondering \"Why was it even made?\" The prequels at least had a story to tell. This one basically just says \"The original Star Wars didn't save the universe and nothing Luke, Han, and Leia did really mattered. Here it is again!\"","displayName":"@WelchysGripe","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T17:24:05.329Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T22:21:16.087Z","user":{"userId":"16ed5b81-31bd-4b15-add5-cb284a86d2f0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"@WelchysGripe","accountLink":null},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great conclusion to an epic franchise!
