Reddit must have been the main source for the movie's narrative and major plot points.  The writers must have be absent during the development phase of this movie.  The new trilogy has made me have a better appreciation for the prequel trilogy.  If you must know how the \"Skywalker\" story ends then you need to see the movie but you should wait for it to hit Disney Plus or rent it from iTunes.  This movie is not worth the time to go to the theater to see.  I should have went to see the new Jumanji movie instead.","displayName":"Calvin C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T13:55:36.711Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T13:55:50.210Z","user":{"userId":"976214801","realm":"RT","displayName":"Calvin C","accountLink":"/user/id/976214801"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I thought the movie was well made, kept my attention and set themselves up for follow up movies if they go that route.","displayName":"Jacob","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T13:55:31.081Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T13:55:31.081Z","user":{"userId":"d4e4034e-3907-4426-aeea-b85fb53ab267","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jacob","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Not perfect, but ticked a lot of the right Star Wars fan boxes.
