Rise of Skywalker tries to tie up the Skywalker saga the best way they can.

The pacing is awful, any moment which could have held real emotional promise is rushed past without letting the audience sink into it. There are too many new elements and characters added in for shallow laughs or weak inspiration that they did not have time to fully explore. Sidestepping established characters storylines in the process of adding new, where was Rose Tico? She barely got any screentime at all, an injustice to a rich an interesting character.\nThe worst sin this movie commits in my opinion is that the Skywalker legacy is utterly decimated in every way imaginable and ultimately Palpatine wins with every Skywalker dead and his granddaughter surviving them. It turned all nine movies into the hopeless saga of a family ruined and tortured by a great evil to the bitter end with no hope of redemption or healing left. To make matters worse the death of the last Skywalker is blown over and never acknowledged in a rushed and soulless ending. There is no mourning, no honoring, no peace for the skywalker legacy. There is a awkward celebration in light of Ben's death moments before and a broken and lonely girl left exactly where she began, utterly alone in a barren desert.","displayName":"Jordyn B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157058403664076/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:36:45.823Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:36:53.328Z","user":{"userId":"978466190","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jordyn B","accountLink":"/user/id/978466190"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is the must see movie of the holidays and does not disappoint!

Great special effects and story line that involved new problems in an old fight. Strange that some could breathe and be heard in open space with no mechanical assist but so goes the mystery of existing in a space void. Once again, the secret was to attack the biggest ship so there was redundancy. The right people died...the right people survived. The movie can be emotional for those who have been following from the beginnings. Well worth the price of the ticket to see the twists and turns many have hoped for.","displayName":"thomas h","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:35:56.604Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:35:56.604Z","user":{"userId":"fc558d8c-079e-4a3f-bc21-a90df0db9b34","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"thomas h","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great ending to the series.","displayName":"Aaron","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:35:20.239Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:35:20.239Z","user":{"userId":"36887C56-57DF-43BE-968B-8F8B6632CF84","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Aaron","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The story brought everything together in a nice way.
