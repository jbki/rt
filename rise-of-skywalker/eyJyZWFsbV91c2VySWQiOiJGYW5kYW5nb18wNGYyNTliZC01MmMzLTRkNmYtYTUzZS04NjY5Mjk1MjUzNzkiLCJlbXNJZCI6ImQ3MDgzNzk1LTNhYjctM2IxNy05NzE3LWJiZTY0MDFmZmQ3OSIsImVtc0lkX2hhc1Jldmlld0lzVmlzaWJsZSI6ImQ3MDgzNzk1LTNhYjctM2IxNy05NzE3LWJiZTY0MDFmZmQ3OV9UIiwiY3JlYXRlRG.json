They had to do a lot of course correction to set up any kind of plot after the mess of the last movie though. And some of it is pretty dumb and way too over-the-top. But overall a fun movie.

J. J. had to clean up the mess Rian Johnson left with episode 8. The movie was very dis-jointed from jumping around and not making it clears as to the reason why, until further into other parts of the movie. This last trilogy has not been good! I hope future movies are better done with better continuity so all the movies go together and the story is easier to follow.","displayName":"Tim P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T19:47:39.246Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T19:47:39.246Z","user":{"userId":"C20C254B-8A8B-48E9-AABD-0983F778D82D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tim P","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great story. i loved how how they tied all the episodes in  to one, but yet it stood alone.
