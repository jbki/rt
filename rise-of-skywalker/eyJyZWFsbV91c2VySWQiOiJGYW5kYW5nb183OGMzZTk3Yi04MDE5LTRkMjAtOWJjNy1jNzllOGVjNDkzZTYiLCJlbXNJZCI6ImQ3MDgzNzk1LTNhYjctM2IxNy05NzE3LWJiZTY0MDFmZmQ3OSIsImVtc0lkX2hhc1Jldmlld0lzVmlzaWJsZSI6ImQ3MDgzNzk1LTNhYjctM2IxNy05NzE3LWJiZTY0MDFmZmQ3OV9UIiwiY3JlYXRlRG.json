I think the critics are dead wrong about the 55% rating. This film was a beautiful end to the saga! The CGI was absolutely amazing, the cast was great and John Williams' score was amazing too. I have to give J.J Abrams a huge round of applause for making it possible to have the late Carrie Fisher in the film. The scenes they used were so perfect and well done that it looked like she was just there filming it. Say what you want about these movies, but I think they all were good movies. Originals, Prequels and the Disney Sequels. It's sad to see it all go now, but let's wait to see what we got coming in the future of Star Wars!","displayName":"Skyler S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T07:19:09.658Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T07:19:35.409Z","user":{"userId":"953187694","realm":"RT","displayName":"Skyler S","accountLink":"/user/id/953187694"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It gave me the closure I needed.
