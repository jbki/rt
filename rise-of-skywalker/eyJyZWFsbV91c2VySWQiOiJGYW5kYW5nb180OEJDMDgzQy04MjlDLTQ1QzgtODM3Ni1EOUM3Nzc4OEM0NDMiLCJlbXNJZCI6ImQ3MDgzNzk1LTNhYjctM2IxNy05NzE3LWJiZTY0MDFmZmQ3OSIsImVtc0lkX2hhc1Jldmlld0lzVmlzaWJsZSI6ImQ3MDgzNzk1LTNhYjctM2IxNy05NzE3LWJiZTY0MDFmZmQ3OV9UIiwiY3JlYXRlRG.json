The plot of sloppy, the acting was meh, even the CG monster looking aliens were overreacting. \n\nOverall this was a classic share screw up by JJ Abrams.

While I feel this movie could have been the story of the entire trilogy, the story serves its purpose.  The connection between Kylo and Rey is fascinating and the duels and choreography of some of their moves were also great.  There was never a dull moment and while some things were left unexplained it was a fun ride.  While it is by no means a perfect Star Wars movie, it is a must-watch and might be my favorite of the sequel trilogy.","displayName":"Max M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T17:35:21.340Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T17:35:42.903Z","user":{"userId":"977844681","realm":"RT","displayName":"Max M","accountLink":"/user/id/977844681"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I thought it was pretty good, fast paced and the story line was a bit far fetched, but overall was enjoyable.
