Fantastic ending that perfectly ties in all three trilogies. I loved the fan service JJ provided. While not necessarily a deep or moving plot, and definitely could have benefited from a longer run time, this proves that JJ Abrams stuck the landing and satisfyingly wrapped up the Skywalker saga.","displayName":"SC","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:43:33.495Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:43:33.495Z","user":{"userId":"B30C79B3-0375-422F-9FAF-A8818D0FC829","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"SC","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"was a very long movie","displayName":"John","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:43:22.053Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:43:22.053Z","user":{"userId":"02b72240-7d3d-4eef-bf4f-c672773a9325","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"John","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved everything about this movie.. it included Action, comedy & was so heartfelt!","displayName":"Elissa","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:42:19.644Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:42:19.644Z","user":{"userId":"8001C22A-FD16-4B01-A396-60B851691D83","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Elissa","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"i thought it was very badly written there were issues but everytime something went wrong there was a solution instantly. i thought that they brought characters back but gave no reasining. however the acting by Adam driver, Daisy Ridley was impressive and the cinematography and production design looked cool in certain scenes.","displayName":"Christian V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:42:14.274Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:42:29.426Z","user":{"userId":"978484795","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christian V","accountLink":"/user/id/978484795"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"One of the worst Star Wars movies that there is.","displayName":"Taru P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:42:13.822Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:42:21.542Z","user":{"userId":"978055969","realm":"RT","displayName":"Taru P","accountLink":"/user/id/978055969"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"As one who has followed the epic Star Wars series over the years, I appreciate what J.J. Abrams did to wrap up this story. Though not as good as predecessors like The Empire Strikes Back or The Force Awakens, Rise of Skywalker was a totally fun thrill ride for one final run in the Star Wars universe. And to it's credit, I really enjoyed all the twists and turns this entry took to wrap up the story that began in 1977 with the classic original. A really fun movie and a satisfying conclusion. Especially for me.","displayName":"Kyle J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1007341660/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:41:30.649Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:41:46.841Z","user":{"userId":"961939265","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kyle J","accountLink":"/user/id/961939265"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Star Wars the rise of skywalker review: Okay where to begin with this film. Firstly I would like to say this is a conclusion series of the Disney Star Wars series and now Star Wars was my all time favorite childhood I really liked it until Disney brought the franchise to their company and what to say about this film it was good and I would like to say this is better than the last Jedi in my opinion. I which they could added more stuff in this film but hey it what it is. Overall I give Star Wars the rise of skywalker. B+ 8/10 I don't care what the critics say about this movie it's just my opinion I really like it. And if you are Star Wars fan than you must see this.","displayName":"Dominic R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2481640845489614/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:39:13.466Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:39:25.468Z","user":{"userId":"978484818","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dominic R","accountLink":"/user/id/978484818"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely amazing.
