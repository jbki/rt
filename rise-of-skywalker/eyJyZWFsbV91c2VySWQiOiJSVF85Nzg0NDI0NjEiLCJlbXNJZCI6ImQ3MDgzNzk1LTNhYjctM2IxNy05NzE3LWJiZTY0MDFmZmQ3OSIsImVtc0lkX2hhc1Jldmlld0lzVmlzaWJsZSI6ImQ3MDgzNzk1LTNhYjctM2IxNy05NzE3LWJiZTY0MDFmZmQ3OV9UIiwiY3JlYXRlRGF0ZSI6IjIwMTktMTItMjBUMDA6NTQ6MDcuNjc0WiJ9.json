It really focuses on the force, sith, and jedi. If you're a handcore star wars nerd/fan you'll really enjoy this.

In fact, the only Star Wars thing I've liked recently was Rogue One. And I'm a diehard fan - of the original three, more so the first two.\nI'll stick to the theatrical releases of the original three. Glad we can sweep the rest under the carpet now and forget they existed. Awesome CGI absolutely wasted, and vanilla popsicle girl is so wholly lacklustre - y'all know who I'm talking about.\nWhat happened to actors with depth and personality? I saw Joker eight times... I didn't even want to finish this.","displayName":"Jan  L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:53:27.278Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:53:32.113Z","user":{"userId":"978219150","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jan  L","accountLink":"/user/id/978219150"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"BEST OF THE THREE!!! nothing is going to beat the original trilogy but the critics are wrong amazing movie from the plot to acting!","displayName":"felipe","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:52:37.046Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:52:37.046Z","user":{"userId":"FB43E11F-E86A-4628-9D6A-EE817770F354","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"felipe","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Truly wonderful book and to an uneven trilogy.

However the pase was much to high, it felt is if 2 movies were forced into one movie, there was little to no character development, the third act was way over the top, and finally our nostalgia for the movies was weaponized far to heavily. However I walked out of the cinema feeling that i was entertained. People saying that it is worse than the phantom menace and attack of the clones arr a bit exaggerating in my opinion.","displayName":"Jordy V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:51:01.520Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:52:48.109Z","user":{"userId":"978442430","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jordy V","accountLink":"/user/id/978442430"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Should have given the third part to Rian Johnson as well...","displayName":"Peter W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:50:33.202Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:50:33.202Z","user":{"userId":"55379202-6CD9-4B01-9E73-7B2806ADE36E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Peter W","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Film is rushed and often feels like there is no structure.
