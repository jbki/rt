I hated The Last Jedi passionately. The Rise of Skywalker definitely had a lot of fan service at the end but overall good. It had the Star Wars feel that was severely lacking in the last movie. If you loved the last one you'll probably hate this one. As a huge fan of the original movies and the Expanded Universe books I feel like this was the best that could be done after Rian Johnson screwed up the new Trilogy so badly.","displayName":"Jonathon Q","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10214639887780204/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:02:34.314Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:02:45.980Z","user":{"userId":"976880816","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonathon Q","accountLink":"/user/id/976880816"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great save by JJ.

If you want a popcorn flick devoid of cohesive storytelling and don't mind characters teleporting around a universe in search of a way to get to a hidden villain hiding for no reason, then this for you. Disney, JJ and Rian all complain that the old school fan just cant accept their character choices. And, while that may be true, the fact is that these are just not well plotted movies with a story that makes any sense at all. Why should the audience care about what they are seeing because Fisney Wars has given zero reason beyond, \"because Star Wars.\"","displayName":"Brent B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002257481189/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:02:25.690Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:02:31.103Z","user":{"userId":"952399547","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brent B","accountLink":"/user/id/952399547"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The worst, most insulting Star Wars movie to date. The movie spits in the face of loyal fans to appeal to the mainstream audience. Its only accomplishment is somehow making The Last Jedi come off as a superior movie. The rushed, lazy, and predictable plot allow for the middling action scenes to be the only reprieve from the urge to walk right out of the theater. Deplorable movie, wouldn't wish its viewing on my worst enemy.","displayName":"Peter D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:02:24.807Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:02:30.602Z","user":{"userId":"978466055","realm":"RT","displayName":"Peter D","accountLink":"/user/id/978466055"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I thought it was a great end to the saga.

A rollercoaster of emotions. Great adventure, characters we care for, music, sound, amazing effects.  Waited my whole life for this. I might of done things differently myself but it is what it is and it is awesome. Can't wait for more Star Wars spin offs that are coming soon, so many adventures in an amazing Universe. Born in the 70s I grew up with the originals, which will always be the best but the prequels and the sequels are still excellent trilogy's in there own right.
