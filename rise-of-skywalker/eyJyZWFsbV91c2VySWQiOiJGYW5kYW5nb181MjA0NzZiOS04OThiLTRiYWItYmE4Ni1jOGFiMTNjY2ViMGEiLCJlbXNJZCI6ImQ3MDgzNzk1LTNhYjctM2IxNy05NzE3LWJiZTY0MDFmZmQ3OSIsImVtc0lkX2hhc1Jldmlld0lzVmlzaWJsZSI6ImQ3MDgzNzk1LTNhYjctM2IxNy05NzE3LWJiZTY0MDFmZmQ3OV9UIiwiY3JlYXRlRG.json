Most scenes are 1-5 seconds long. JJ Abrams doesn't seem to want to make a movie here. It's something else and that something is not good. Also, the 86% fresh score for audience reviews on Rotten Tomatoes is not being truthful. I would advise Rotten Tomatoes to fix that or its credibility will go down even lower.","displayName":"Kirk S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/704402513/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:10:00.758Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:10:12.562Z","user":{"userId":"908128308","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kirk S","accountLink":"/user/id/908128308"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Very faced paced film that hits many marks, with a spectacular finish.","displayName":"Davy C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:09:56.025Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:09:56.025Z","user":{"userId":"33704F5B-DB9F-42CD-9CDA-DCCF80144E30","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Davy C","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"This movie is too cringe to be fully viewed.
