I really did. The beginning was a convoluted mess, I was pretty shocked when they said palpatine was back but never explained how (I understand the idea of the 'he can live forever because of dark side' thing, but he also fell down the center of the death star before it BLEW UP, so...)\n(Spoilers)\nI loved the idea of the Redemption arc for Kylo Ren, and I really wish they would have gone into more of his time as Ben Solo rather than immediately just killing him off. He was honestly my favorite character in all of the series. \n\nRey seemed... Overpowered. I've never even heard of force healing before, and I'm sure if Luke had known about it he would have love to have saved his father. It just seems like they tried too hard with all of it, to fix mistakes past movies made and trying to wrap it up as best they could. It was twisted, confusing and I wish they had done things differently from the beginning...","displayName":"Heather V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10213933787199512/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T23:21:24.707Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T23:21:33.628Z","user":{"userId":"977826686","realm":"RT","displayName":"Heather V","accountLink":"/user/id/977826686"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved all the movies, start to finish.

Sure are, but it was consistently entertaining and at the end of the day, this is Star Wars, it's a type of serialized entertainment not Kubrick or Scorsese. For me, I got what I wanted from it.\nAnd just for clarity, in case anyone gives 2 sh1ts(which they probably dont!) I enjoyed the last jedi too for similar reasons.

It's nothing but a giant middle finger to all star wars fans. Discredits everything any other character in the saga has done. \n\nThe main plot is who Rey is, and then denies the whole thing and claims to be someone else, and to also be a Jedi, despite only ever acting in the same ways that a Sith would. She's not a jedi, she'd be a sith because she's always angry.\n\nBen Solo is the real hero of the trilogy. \n\nIf the goal of the films were to have strong, empowering female leads, then they failed miserably because Rey only comes across as whiney, and without explanation or any reason, is able to a bunch of never before done force powers. No training or anything. Almost all her scenes were terrible. I'd say give me a film on Poe Dameron and his my gal pal, but female characters have been written so poorly.","displayName":"Andrew B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001124748331/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T23:12:03.431Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T23:12:11.407Z","user":{"userId":"970949828","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew B","accountLink":"/user/id/970949828"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"A lot stories at once, got lost in the main story, my woke me up at the end of it","displayName":"Al J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T23:11:55.919Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T23:12:05.659Z","user":{"userId":"977817150","realm":"RT","displayName":"Al J","accountLink":"/user/id/977817150"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"}]}
