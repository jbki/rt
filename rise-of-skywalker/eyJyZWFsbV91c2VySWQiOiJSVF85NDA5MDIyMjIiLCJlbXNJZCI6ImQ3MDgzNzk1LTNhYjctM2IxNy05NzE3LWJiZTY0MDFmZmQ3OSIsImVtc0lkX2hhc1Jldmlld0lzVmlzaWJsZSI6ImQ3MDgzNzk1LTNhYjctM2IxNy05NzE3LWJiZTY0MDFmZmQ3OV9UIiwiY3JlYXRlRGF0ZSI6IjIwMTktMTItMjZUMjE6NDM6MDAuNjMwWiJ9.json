This movie shows how inconsistent and how Disney lacked a ground map from the start. It's lack of character development and overall plot is so jarring it's hard to get invested. Felt like a non-canon fanboy flick rather than a legitimate Star Wars. Cinematic for sure. Ben Solo is the best story arc here.","displayName":"William J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/603025069/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T21:39:10.848Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T21:39:25.247Z","user":{"userId":"785081036","realm":"RT","displayName":"William J","accountLink":"/user/id/785081036"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"My wife and I felt it was the best Star Wars of the last two series (6) movies.
