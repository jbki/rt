Well this film does not make that mistake. Everything is here to end this nine film adventure in a very satisfying and emotionally poignant way. Is there clever, witty dialogue or original and unexpected plot twists? No. But what you will find is visually stunning cinematography, near-constant action, and powerfully uplifting themes. Shame on the critics for thrashing this film, especially with all the truly bad films out there.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T22:42:03.701Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:27:18.646Z","user":{"userId":"971071832","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/971071832"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A satisfying and emotional roller coaster to end another overall phenomenal trilogy.","displayName":"Colin C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/873347939489657/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T22:41:54.635Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T22:42:04.123Z","user":{"userId":"976542438","realm":"RT","displayName":"Colin C","accountLink":"/user/id/976542438"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"fitting end to a generational story.  afterwards you'll look back and notice correlations to the original trilogy.
