TFA was a setup and I had hoped that the series would have some payoff. People say things like \"nonstop action\" and repeat soundbites like \"Subverting expectations\" and have generally no idea what they're talking about. Nonstop action cannot make up for lack of cohesive plot and I feel that was what this movie was trying to do from the get-go.\n\nThe shoe-horning of Leia's involvement and training honestly felt kind of like a betrayal of her character because she never NEEDED to be a jedi to be great. She was great before, she was a military leader, a tactician, educated - all of those things are worthy in and of themselves. \n\nThe Last Jedi left a lot of hard feelings for me personally, and I knew it was going to be hard to come back from and I was not wrong. Bringing Palpatine back was a cheap move, as was tying her to Rey's parentage. It made no sense, was heavily shoehorned, and the whole \"assassination angle\" doesn't make any sense for his character since Sith EXPLOIT the powerful youth and corrupt them if they can. \n\nI have hated from the very beginning the treatment of Luke's character, the dissolution of his achievements and the sabotage of his character arc. Same with Han Solo, I absolutely could not stand that they dismissed all of his character growth. Not Leia's though, she's just out there in space living her best strong woman life while all the men have let her down. Sure. Sure. \n\nI don't buy it. I don't like it. I am severely disappointed and to think that THIS is what will be attached to Star Wars FOREVER now, I am a little bitter over it.","displayName":"chaney r","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:14:20.894Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:14:29.851Z","user":{"userId":"977899316","realm":"RT","displayName":"chaney r","accountLink":"/user/id/977899316"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Incredibly cheesy, like bad fan fiction","displayName":"Mat B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002389438263/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:14:18.369Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:14:23.305Z","user":{"userId":"911339476","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mat B","accountLink":"/user/id/911339476"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I haven't been this disappointed since Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.","displayName":"Byron  C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:14:11.699Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:14:11.699Z","user":{"userId":"978453270","realm":"RT","displayName":"Byron  C","accountLink":"/user/id/978453270"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome Movie!!!!

Though Episode 9 tries really hard to undo the mess that was Episode 8 and is super in your face about it the movie completely undermines Anakin's 6 film story Arc. It's not the garbage that Episode 8 was but it still isn't good, you don't do my man Anakin dirty and expect a good review. They also tried really hard to sneak in some PC garbage in the last scene. I'm throwing this entire trilogy in the trash I'll stick with the original 6. 2 out 5 stars.","displayName":"Lawrence K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001248144018/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:13:40.121Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:13:45.941Z","user":{"userId":"950513921","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lawrence K","accountLink":"/user/id/950513921"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I really enjoyed it.
