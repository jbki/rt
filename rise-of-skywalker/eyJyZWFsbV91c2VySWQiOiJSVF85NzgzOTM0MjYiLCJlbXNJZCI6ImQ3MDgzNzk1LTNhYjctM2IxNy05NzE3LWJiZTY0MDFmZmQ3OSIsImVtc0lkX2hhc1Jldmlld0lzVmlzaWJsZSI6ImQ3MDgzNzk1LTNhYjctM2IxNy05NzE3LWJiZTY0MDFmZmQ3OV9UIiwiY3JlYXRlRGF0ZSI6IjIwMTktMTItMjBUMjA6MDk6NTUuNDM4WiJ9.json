It certainly doesn't deserve a 10, or even an 8. Inconsistent pacing, an incomprehensible plot, and lack of internal consistency even among the 3 sequel trilogy films hamper this final installment, which fails to ask any important questions, or provide any meaningful answers. It actually reverses some of the most important parts of the prequel and original trilogies, and fails to capture the imagination. The Skywalker Saga was over before this movie was even conceptualized.","displayName":"Duncan M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2754960824527114/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:09:21.495Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:09:29.427Z","user":{"userId":"978452773","realm":"RT","displayName":"Duncan M","accountLink":"/user/id/978452773"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"It just felt like everyone making the movie was tired of Star Wars and just wanted to end it as fast as possible- so they just did the easiest ending they could think of.
