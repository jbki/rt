There were many fan service moments & a few things here and there that had me questioning,  but overall I enjoyed the experience.

Maybe not, but I had some fun & wasnâ€™t leaving the theatre offended.

If they really wanted to invoke the spirit of the originals, they'd let their imaginations go and surprise us. Whatever it's flaws, The Last Jedi made the possibilities of the Star Wars universe seem open and interesting again, but ROS largely closed those doors. There was a subtlety and sophistication in TLJ's approach to the metaphysics of the force, moral psychology, and religious belief, whereas ROS reverts to a relatively simplistic, un-challenging perspective. J.J. Abrams is a clever, capable craftsman but I think he's just isn't insightful enough to make anything deeper that he does. ROS has plenty to be said for it as entertainment, but it not only failed to capitalize on the promise of TLJ, it actively undid some of it.  Like, I'm pissed that Rey isn't really a nobody and we're back to fetishizing bloodlines. Although, if we had to do that, I like the way they went with it. And in general, if they were going to backslide and go shallow, ROS was probably about as good as it could have been.","displayName":"Anjon D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:01:37.753Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:01:49.075Z","user":{"userId":"974836276","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anjon D","accountLink":"/user/id/974836276"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved this movie.
