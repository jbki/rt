I think as a whole the trilogy really made me fall in love with the main characters, Rey, Fin, Poe, Ben, and I am just happy to see how everything turned out. In the end I  felt like C3P0 who really enjoyed watching their friends one last time on the big screen. To everyone who worked on this movie thank you, if this trilogy was anything, it certainly wasn't easy.","displayName":"Ross J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1382966612/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T14:54:30.731Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T14:54:30.731Z","user":{"userId":"846102927","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ross J","accountLink":"/user/id/846102927"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent from start to finish.

Sad to see end of an era that began 40 years ago. Ridley and Driver were excellent but plot was convoluted and walked too many Last of the Jedi  revelations. Wish they had not used Fisher footage.

Maybe this movie is hoping for a participation award like the message it's trying to convey? Or maybe it's not trying to convey? I don't know because the story was so remarkably full of fluffy sap and chasms at the same time, it's hard to tell. Maybe that's the award they were going for? I guess anybody can come back from the dead now if you really hope and believe hard enough...
