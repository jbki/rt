Unless in the Clone Wars cartoon there is never any mention of Palpatine having any children in any movie or show until this movie. I feel like the resolution that was felt after Episode 6 can now never be felt again, Disney never addressed how Palpatine actually returns or if he can do it over and over again. It was a fun movie to watch but without the Star Wars title never makes it to filming.","displayName":"Adam","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T21:29:44.237Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T21:29:44.237Z","user":{"userId":"193018B4-01F9-4F1C-966B-0C7E4DE0B879","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Adam","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"7h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"There were highs and plenty of lows.
