After being utterly disappointing in the previous installment, I went into TRoS with low expectations. It did not fail to bring back the classic fun and excitement of a Star Wars film. I'm not sure how the last movie could get a 90% from critics, and this only a 50%. This movie was leaps and bounds better. A more thrilling story line, twists and turns, epic light saber battles, new perspectives on the force and Jedi/Sith relations. It was epic. I will say the beginning of the movie did feel like JJ Abrams was cleaning up from the last mess of a movie, but it had to happen, and he did it well. I'm glad this saga is going out with a bang instead of a fizzle.","displayName":"MaraLee L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:42:15.945Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:42:17.516Z","user":{"userId":"916881403","realm":"RT","displayName":"MaraLee L","accountLink":"/user/id/916881403"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"If your a Star Wars fan youâ€™ll love this movie!
