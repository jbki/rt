I can no longer remember the storyline, or much of the plot.  In fact, I don't think it was all that easy to follow while I was actually watching it.  I remember thinking to myself, \"self, this movie really seems to be trying to make itself relevant to what the youth of America & Europe are thinking TODAY.  I don't think that's how you make a timeless Star Wars movie like the first 3 were (episodes IV, V, VI.)\"  Those 3 can be watching in ANOTHER 40 years, and people 40 years from now will like them.  I don't think this one will be with them.","displayName":"Ninja97","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T15:07:14.760Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T15:07:14.760Z","user":{"userId":"9b241735-4830-4bae-82b3-48b9d6fd8455","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ninja97","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"the storyline kept you on the edge of your seat","displayName":"Calvin W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T15:06:38.443Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T15:06:38.443Z","user":{"userId":"5C866D9D-02A8-4A69-933A-E35FB602008A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Calvin W","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I wish I could give this movie 0 stars, as it throws any notion of actual storytelling in favor of nostalgia and winking at the camera (almost literally in 1 case).

This movie was a mess and as a movie wasn't too great but it made me forgive the last Jedi. Made me realize that it wasn't the directors faults, I can honestly say J.J was trying his best and Rian probably was too. (Although he derailed everything that had been set up and summed up people's complaints on the movie to us being sexist or man-babies.) \nI hope disney learns from this.","displayName":"Bruno G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1172422382/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T15:02:55.118Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T15:03:12.543Z","user":{"userId":"915161498","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bruno G","accountLink":"/user/id/915161498"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"An awesome finish to the Star Wars saga!","displayName":"Denise S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T15:02:28.910Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T15:02:28.910Z","user":{"userId":"4762AFA5-4E0F-4CD9-B39C-CEABA86F36DD","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Denise S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"JJ successfully and brilliantly righted many of the wrongs with which Rian Johnsonâ€™s Last Jedi nearly broke Star Wars.","displayName":"Betsy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T15:01:29.302Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T15:01:29.302Z","user":{"userId":"D0AF491D-4F64-46B3-8567-949AFD3828A3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Betsy","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie, I had a lot of fun, there was exatcly what I expected, a great star wars, of course it has a lot of problems, but thoes had never been a problem to the franchise fans, I don't see why it has become a problem now.","displayName":"vinicius b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T15:00:56.618Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T15:01:01.276Z","user":{"userId":"978480010","realm":"RT","displayName":"vinicius b","accountLink":"/user/id/978480010"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The movie ended the saga I thought in the best way it could with the characters.
