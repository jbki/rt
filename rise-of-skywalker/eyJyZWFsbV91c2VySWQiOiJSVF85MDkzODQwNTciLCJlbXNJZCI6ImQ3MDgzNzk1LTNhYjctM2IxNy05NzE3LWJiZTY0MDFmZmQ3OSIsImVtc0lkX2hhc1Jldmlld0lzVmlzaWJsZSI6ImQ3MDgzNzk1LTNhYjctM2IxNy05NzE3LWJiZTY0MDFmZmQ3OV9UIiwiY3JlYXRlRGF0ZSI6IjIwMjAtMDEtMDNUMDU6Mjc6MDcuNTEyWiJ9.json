I never could get into this episode and I kept waiting to be drawn in, but was not.  No portion of the movie wowed me or say to myself that was cool.  The ending was expected and I was good with that, but the overall product was bland and disappointing.  Greatest movies/stories of a lifetime with a complete letdown last episode.","displayName":"The darkside","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T05:26:52.313Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T05:26:52.313Z","user":{"userId":"fb32dc58-e109-4142-a084-3b3b8eba0579","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"The darkside","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"23h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Movie felt rushed, bad storyline","displayName":"Joseph D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T05:25:59.634Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T05:26:14.258Z","user":{"userId":"863345132","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph D","accountLink":"/user/id/863345132"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"23h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"This last installation was keeping with the formula that  established Star Wars in the beginning.
