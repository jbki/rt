It was action packed from start to finish, almost to a fault. I do believe it felt rushed because the writers seem to have abandoned the direction of TLJ and went in a totally new direction, essentially squeezing a trilogy into one movie. There were moments I loved and moments that didn't make much sense but for me the good outweighed the cheesy. I thought the ending perfectly set up the future of Star Wars.","displayName":"Mike C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000252010906/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:03:50.371Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:03:58.271Z","user":{"userId":"970489768","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike C","accountLink":"/user/id/970489768"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was made for the true fans.
