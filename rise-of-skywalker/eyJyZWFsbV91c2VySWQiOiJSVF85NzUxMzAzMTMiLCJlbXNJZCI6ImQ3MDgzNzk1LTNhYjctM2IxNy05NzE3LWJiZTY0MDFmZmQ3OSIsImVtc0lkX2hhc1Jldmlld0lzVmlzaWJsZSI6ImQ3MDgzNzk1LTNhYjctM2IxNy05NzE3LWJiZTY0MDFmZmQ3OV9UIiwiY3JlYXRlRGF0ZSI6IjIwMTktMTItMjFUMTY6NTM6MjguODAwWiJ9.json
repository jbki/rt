Yeah they were parts in the movie that couldve been me clearer and better but overall it was an excellent movie.  The critic say otherwise but at the end of the day they get paid money to do the reviews to control what people see in dont see. Where is Im going to just give you my honest opinion as a fan before critic.","displayName":"Michael","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T16:52:54.637Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T16:52:54.637Z","user":{"userId":"640b88b4-08b9-41f2-b575-f30491bf2c3c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The best and the last of Star war movie.","displayName":"Phong N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T16:52:44.736Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T16:52:44.736Z","user":{"userId":"68c6d528-30f9-4f15-8034-50ab20ee0e55","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Phong N","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A M A Z I N G !
