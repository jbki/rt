It does it, but only just.

I went into the cinema thinking the movie was going to be terrible, I was happy to be proven wrong. It's to bad we won't get to see The last Jedi through the eyes of JJ it would of been a great set up to this last film and for characters and general lore but that isn't the case so rots has some people feeling it was a little rushed and out of left field, but ultimately still feeling like a Star Wars movie.","displayName":"Jayden M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/903366553398426/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:48:00.452Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:48:20.856Z","user":{"userId":"978454437","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jayden M","accountLink":"/user/id/978454437"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was outstanding way to conclude the Skywalker Saga!!
