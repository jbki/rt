Just why?! Why didn't we get a chance to see the chosen one ONE LAST TIME?!! The whole saga was about the prophecy of the chosen one. What a massive failure! I am beyond frustrated with this particular thing. Other than that it was cool movie but the conclusion wasn't as epic and legendary as lifelong fans wanted. So much things could have gone in a different way in the 3rd act. But still, good job JJ. Nice try to save SW after the mess R.J. did in the The Last Jedi.","displayName":"Viktor R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1658277578/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:58:59.487Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:06:41.258Z","user":{"userId":"866086274","realm":"RT","displayName":"Viktor R","accountLink":"/user/id/866086274"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Its like they try to ruin Star Wars. I tough that no way this movie is worse than The Last Jedi, I was wrong..... Jedi and sith turned into superheroes and they tried to get people like the movie with so much of member berries.

Fair to say that JJ Abrams had a tough job trying to create a decent film after two very 'contrasting' films (for the record I did enjoy TLJ, but no denying it was very split on opinions, and probably had more negative reactions than positive), especially as one could argue JJ and Rian had two different views on the direction of the overall story. I think with this film, JJ did a good job with what he was able to work with for this finale of the current trilogy and the whole saga.\n\nGetting it out of the way... my one main negative is the story felt rushed and crammed, to try sort out the 'problems' with TLJ, and trying to introduce the many new elements in this final film. Perhaps if given one more film, the story might have worked. Although I personally don't think introducing the Emperor into this trilogy is lazy writing at all, contrary to other opinions... If Legends canon is anything anything to go by, it can and does work (Although I won't deny that the introduction and story of the Emperor in this film is rushed; again, perhaps another film was needed?).\n\nAnd now onto positives: special effects were of course great; visuals were spectacular; music was on-point again (it's a shame John Williams won't compose for another Star Wars film; he is truly a master among all film composers past and present); and the character arcs/development was actually well-handled in this film and therefore pays-off for this trilogy. As much as Rey's story now feels more fleshed-out because of this film, and it's fair to say Kylo Ren has the best character arc in this trilogy, and possibly one of the best in the whole franchise (alongside Luke Skywalker himself). Also the character chemistry between Rey, Poe and Finn was great; I wished we'd been able to see more of that since TFA!! Also some good fan-service, but I won't get into detail about that here. The acting was amazing from everyone in this film; again, especially Kylo (Adam Driver). But ooof, it was amazing to see Ian McDiarmid back to reprise his role as the Emperor... He takes on the role so well, and has a real presence in all the scenes he's in.\n\nOverall, I did enjoy the film. If you're a Star Wars fan, definitley worth watching to witness the finale of the whole saga. If you're just a casual film-goer, I would suggest you watch the OT, before you get to this film (obviously watching Episodes 1-3 and then episodes 7 + 8 beforehand... ðŸ˜‰ ).","displayName":"Peter W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:57:12.365Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T13:04:32.976Z","user":{"userId":"978442156","realm":"RT","displayName":"Peter W","accountLink":"/user/id/978442156"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"If this had been episode 7, they could have done something very good, as it its, it feels too little too late.","displayName":"Apolo A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1637904176272143/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:56:44.571Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:56:54.450Z","user":{"userId":"976993313","realm":"RT","displayName":"Apolo A","accountLink":"/user/id/976993313"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"As usual, dont listen to snobs critics.
