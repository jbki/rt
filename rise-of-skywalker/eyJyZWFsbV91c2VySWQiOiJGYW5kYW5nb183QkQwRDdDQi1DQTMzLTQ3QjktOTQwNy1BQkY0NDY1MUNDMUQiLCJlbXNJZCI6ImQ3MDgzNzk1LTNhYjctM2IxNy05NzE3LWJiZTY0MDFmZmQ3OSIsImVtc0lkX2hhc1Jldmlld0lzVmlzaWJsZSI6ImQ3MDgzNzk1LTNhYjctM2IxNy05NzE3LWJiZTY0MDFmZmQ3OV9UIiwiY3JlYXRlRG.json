Main problems (besides what critics are saying) - terrible editing. Super fast edits for a lot of the movie. Several locations waay too dark, especially the last battle.  We got none of the agonized, tantruming, emotional Kylo that made him the best character in the first one. Waay too many MacGuffins and almost deaths. Few great cinematic moments of grandeur (ie salt planet, hoth, wide desert scapes).  At least the mandalorin is good.","displayName":"Monica  D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:59:36.748Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:00:27.745Z","user":{"userId":"978242510","realm":"RT","displayName":"Monica  D","accountLink":"/user/id/978242510"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"}]}
