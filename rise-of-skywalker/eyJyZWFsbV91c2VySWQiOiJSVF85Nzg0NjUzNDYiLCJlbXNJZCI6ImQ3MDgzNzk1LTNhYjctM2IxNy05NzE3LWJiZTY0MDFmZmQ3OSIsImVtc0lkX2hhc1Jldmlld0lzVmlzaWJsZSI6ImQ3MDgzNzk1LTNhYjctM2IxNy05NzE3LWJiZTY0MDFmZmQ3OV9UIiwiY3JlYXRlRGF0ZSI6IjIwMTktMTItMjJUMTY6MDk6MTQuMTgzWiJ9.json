I saw it opening night and loved it. I thought it was a disservice to the franchise by saying that it just \"fan-service.\" Sure, there is a lot for fans and it was rushed at times. You can even say the plot was convoluted at points, but it did not take away from the overall pleasing aspects of this film. I think it is a fitting conclusion and I will be watching it again in theaters.","displayName":"Michael T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10218821681185386/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T16:08:22.775Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T16:08:30.498Z","user":{"userId":"978465374","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael T","accountLink":"/user/id/978465374"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"They did the best they could with what they were left with.
