It’s fun and entertains and does SOOOO MUCH to fix everything The Last Jedi messed up. The characters are actually likeable and the story just makes sense. I can’t give it a 5/5 because the pacing is a little bit rushed, but it needed to be because JJ Abrams had a lot to cram in in order to remedy everything Rian Johnson messes up.

It was excellent for what it was. A lot of cool Star Wars lore unfolding on the big screen bigger and bolder than anything you've ever seen. I can accept all the reveals and be ok with it as a fan. The whole sequel trilogy relies too heavily on the originals and I consider the originals to be the best. This movie had a virtually impossible task to wrap up and tie all 9 films. It doesn't really wrap up the prequels the way I had hoped. I honestly do not think having the sequels continue a conflict with the empire made any sense or was a good idea. The film also tries to do too much. Despite all that, this is a good Star Wars film. I love Star Wars. I can be as critical as any fan out there but at the end of the day I will watch any Star Wars film in theaters. It is a special treat.I really liked this one.","displayName":"Aaron J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/15200418/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:07:38.948Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:08:42.499Z","user":{"userId":"907315320","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aaron J","accountLink":"/user/id/907315320"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Long live JJ Abrams!

Could have used a little more back stories on a few things that were brought up. However, it was the best of the last three trilogy's. As someone who has read over 30 Star wars books, there was a way better trilogy already out there. But as far as the Disney version goes. This one was better than the last two. I'm a Star wars fan, and even with all its flaws, it's still a Star wars story and I take it as such. Too much negativity out there, not going to get it here.","displayName":"Grandmaster Doc","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:07:36.026Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:07:36.026Z","user":{"userId":"A89867B6-A3F0-42BF-948F-B16C946A0917","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Grandmaster Doc","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"perfect ending to what has been with me for decades","displayName":"Todd","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:07:33.544Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:07:33.544Z","user":{"userId":"D87F75DF-EF37-4502-9502-B9DB41E157A1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Todd","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Good action like the previous JJ flick, but the film is a hollow shell.

It really feels like you are watching multiple movies not a single movie.  How Palpatine survived is never explained.  How the interaction between Rey and Kylo when they are physically in 2 different places (along with how someone could teleport a light saber between people).  Elements in this film contradict the Episode....Luke's force ghost catches Rey's light saber as she is throwing it in the fire, telling her that a light saber deserves better respect, yet he threw away his light saber when Rey first gave it to him.  I could go on and on about contradictions but all you need to know is the majority of the spoilers posted prior to the movie came out are true!
