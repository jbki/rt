He is the chosen one and when you go see the film, you'll see why I'm upset.

Visuals are good and story is ok. Some characters are written well but no different from your average sci-fi flick\n\nIf you see it as a Star Wars fan, you will feel like someone set fire to all you have loved and shat on its ashes. It breaks lore and continuity it has established for years and is nothing but nostalgia baiting and retconning the movie. Frankly you'd get a better story from the Dark Empire books and I haven't even read them, but I believe they are more faithful than this.","displayName":"Nathan M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2040503222684273/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:16:47.990Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:16:51.836Z","user":{"userId":"977720654","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nathan M","accountLink":"/user/id/977720654"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely loved it.
