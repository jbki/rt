If you are a Star Wars fan you need to see and judge for yourself.  I have no doubt that some purists will not like the story line however for me as an \"observer\" of the complete story I liked the treatment and would recommend seeing it.","displayName":"Michael C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T22:19:57.271Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T22:19:57.271Z","user":{"userId":"a9fe2114-c42e-4fe0-9cff-5c661bf15803","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael C","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely awesome.

They're IDIOTS.  The Last Jedi was as great movie as any other Star Wars.  If you grew up with the Skywalkers since the 1970's like I have The Last Jedi will actually be a tear jerker in one or two scenes.  The IMs (Idiot Millennials) that are critics today don't know anything about real entertainment than they do about anything else.","displayName":"Matthew B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T22:19:15.272Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T22:19:15.272Z","user":{"userId":"978484936","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew B","accountLink":"/user/id/978484936"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What a great movie.
