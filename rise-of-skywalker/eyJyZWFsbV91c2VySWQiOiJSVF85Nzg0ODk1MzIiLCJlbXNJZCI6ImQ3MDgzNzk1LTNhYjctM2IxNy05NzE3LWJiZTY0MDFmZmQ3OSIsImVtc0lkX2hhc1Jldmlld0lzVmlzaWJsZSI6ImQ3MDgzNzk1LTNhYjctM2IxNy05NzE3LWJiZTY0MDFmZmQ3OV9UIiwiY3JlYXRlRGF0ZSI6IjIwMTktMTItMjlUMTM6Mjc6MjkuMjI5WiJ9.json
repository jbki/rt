Was it the best movie of the series? No actually it wasnâ€™t.  Are there holes in the storyline? As a matter of fact, yes. When a person can take it for what it is, just a movie then it is a fantastic watch.","displayName":"George B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T13:27:21.951Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T13:27:21.951Z","user":{"userId":"42D4EFE7-752C-436F-8D91-0091524E8D5D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"George B","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A fitting end to the 42 year saga.
