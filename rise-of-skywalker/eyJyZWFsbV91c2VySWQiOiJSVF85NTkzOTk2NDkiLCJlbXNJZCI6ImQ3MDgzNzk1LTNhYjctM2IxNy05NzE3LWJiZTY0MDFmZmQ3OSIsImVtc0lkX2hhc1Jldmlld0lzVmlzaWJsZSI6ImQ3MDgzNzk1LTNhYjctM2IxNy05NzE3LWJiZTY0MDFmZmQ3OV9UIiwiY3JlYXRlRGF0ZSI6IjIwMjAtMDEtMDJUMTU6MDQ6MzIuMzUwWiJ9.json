I go way back to the original movies which were my favorite.  The movie was good.   It was fast paced which was good and bad I think as you didn't get time to really think about anything but with the snipets of characters from the original movies it brought back good memories and really wrapped everything up for me.  I am glad that they finally finished Rae's back story and I did not see THAT coming.  It was good.  My boys and I enjoyed it and would recommend seeing it.","displayName":"KJMus","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T15:03:05.127Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T15:03:05.127Z","user":{"userId":"759db2c1-3d03-408a-9187-67c817c7df13","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"KJMus","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"BEST of all of the sequels !!!!","displayName":"Geraldine P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T15:01:04.917Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T15:01:04.917Z","user":{"userId":"1e85ab16-3020-4713-a752-7a03ee3cbbd6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Geraldine P","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Disney totally ruined the story of Star Wars, they've made what they do best - yet another junk food :(","displayName":"Nikola D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1777284198/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T15:00:50.529Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T15:00:50.529Z","user":{"userId":"978498460","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nikola D","accountLink":"/user/id/978498460"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good Ending I think!
