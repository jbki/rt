You barely have time to process one scene before it jumps to the next. There's no real buildup. If you watch all of the trailers and tv spots together, that's it. That's basically the movie. Overall, it's not completely horrible, but I can't say I like either. Adam Driver is truly the only saving grace.","displayName":"Amelia C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T01:34:40.252Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:52:22.082Z","user":{"userId":"978436399","realm":"RT","displayName":"Amelia C","accountLink":"/user/id/978436399"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A fun ride and great way to end the series.
