Abrams tried to impress the fans. Tick all the boxes but failed to tell a good story. To me, I expect to see how the saga concludes, not closure. Sadly, it's utterly unsatisfying, and melodramatic. That Poe's speech about fighting back is truly cringe-worthy. I have to check if I am actually watching Independence Day instead. I like Rey previously but it's depressing watching her in this film. Why so moody? \n\nThe acting is truly atrocious. Boyega needs to spend a little less money on botox.  Rey should at least try to look at the camera once instead of the constant sideway-forlorn-stare. Tran's acting is so OTT. I get it, her part is small so her scenes need to stand out but does she really need to crank up the histrionics? Likewise, the bad guys exaggerate their evil ways by making \"evil faces\" which is pure comic material.\n\nI won't spoil the plot but there are a few scenes that made me screamed silently \"oh pa-leeease, really?\" And it's a very typical Disney film ie the big honchos' messy hands were imprinted on output.\n\nLack-lustre. Lack of imagination. I still give this a 3 star because it is a Star Wars film. Thanks, J.J. Abrams for ruining a great saga.","displayName":"Erik C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1151388276/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:19:32.499Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:19:36.242Z","user":{"userId":"903828431","realm":"RT","displayName":"Erik C","accountLink":"/user/id/903828431"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!!!

And I'm happy to say that this is the WORST Star Wars film to date. ‘The Rise of Skywalker' is treated like a movie made for the fans, but honestly, it's the final middle finger to them. Granted, a lot of people may end up liking the movie because it retconned ‘The Last Jedi', but I don't see how this made anything better. This movie was treated like an average children's movie rather than a Sci-Fi epic conclusion to a forty-two year running franchise beloved by millions. Conundrum on top of conundrum, cheesy dialogue/humor, unnecessary twists, needless callbacks, and plenty of cat-and-mouse type antics. The only good things in this film is the engaging action sequences, yet they are too quick for you to actually be on the edge of your seat for (referred to for the beginning of the film, until the final battle), and the visuals, which most are eye-catching. What a way to end Star Wars...Like the way you'd unexpectedly lose someone you care about. That's how I feel about this. Like as if I lost someone very important in my life.","displayName":"Derek R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:18:05.639Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:18:19.468Z","user":{"userId":"977279480","realm":"RT","displayName":"Derek R","accountLink":"/user/id/977279480"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"IMO It is about the best JJA could do with what he had. It feels heavy with patchwork and rushed in its effort to develop an epic plot, but again, he had to make do. I like the development of the mythological/metaphysical aspects of the SW universe, and I believe it is left in a good standing for further development. \n\nFinally Kylo Beats Rey in a light saber fight, he deserved that after what they did in Episode VII. A justification was also given as to why there are only ever two Sith Lords (the master trains the strongest apprentice possible so he can be killed by him and live on in him). \n\nThe new display of mechanics of the force were very cool in concept although a bit OP in execution (unless justified by the fact that less force wielders means a more concentrated/intense display of its power... total conjecture).","displayName":"Paolo L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100003779353606/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:17:36.411Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:17:42.123Z","user":{"userId":"978441834","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paolo L","accountLink":"/user/id/978441834"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"A good ending, although some moments felt obviously forced. The dynamic was overall good, although there were a few plot holes and some characters haven't been used correctly. Although I liked Abrams' choices, I feel he could have gone midway by keeping some elements from TLJ, instead of ignoring it all together. I'm pretty sure most people will like it. Not the best SW, but certainly not the worst.","displayName":"David K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10215051129141656/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:17:33.972Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:17:41.129Z","user":{"userId":"976976149","realm":"RT","displayName":"David K","accountLink":"/user/id/976976149"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"It was a fun movie with great action scenes and wonderful sights. With that said, the film failed to deliver a good script, from the beginning conveying the feeling that there was another movie between The Last Jedi and this one. It also reached its finale at the expense of narrative elements that had already been delivered decades ago under the hands of George Lucas, showing a total lack of creativity.","displayName":"Joo P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10214857485657838/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:17:20.239Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:17:30.163Z","user":{"userId":"978429745","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joo P","accountLink":"/user/id/978429745"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great action with a wholesome ending .","displayName":"Beach W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:17:10.456Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:17:10.456Z","user":{"userId":"978441864","realm":"RT","displayName":"Beach W","accountLink":"/user/id/978441864"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"}]}
