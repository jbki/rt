There was very little to work with and the decisions made l think were all reasonable.\n\nWhile TLJ provided reviewerservice this does certainly provide fanservice. As an audience member and fan l was OK with that - what? A director make a movie audience and fans world like? How dare he? \n\nThe re introduction of Palpatine also provides for an interesting return and explanation of unexplained characters.\n\nI would recommend going in with an open mind and to just enjoy the ride for a couple of hours (and try and ignore the overly critical reviewers whom out of anger and spite on the reversal of TLJ are punishing the movie with 1 star reviews).","displayName":"Rob L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:42:11.727Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:08:53.740Z","user":{"userId":"978460917","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rob L","accountLink":"/user/id/978460917"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Lots going on over the 2 hours 21 minutes which makes the movie very busy, i.e. just as you are trying to get your head around what just happened something equally important is happening.\nI'm sure watching a couple of times will iron this out as may well be the intention.\n\nAt the end of the day it starts with Star and ends in Wars.","displayName":"Patrick F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:41:41.170Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:42:53.067Z","user":{"userId":"978460937","realm":"RT","displayName":"Patrick F","accountLink":"/user/id/978460937"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I laughed, I cried, I got anxious and I rejoiced.
