It's fun in places, but the whole is much less than the sum of its parts.

This episode is one of a kind. It had all the action and all the suspense that will leave everyone on the edge of their seats. It also pays tribute to all of the greatest moments in STAR WARS history. As the story of the Skywalker legacy comes to a close, it will leave a huge impact on many that have been there since the beginning. The way it ended will leave a huge smile on everyone's faces. To be honest, THE RISE OF SKYWALKER has a special place in my life as my all time favorite episode in the STAR WARS saga. This movie delivers.","displayName":"Cody W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001967903877/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:21:22.896Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:21:27.631Z","user":{"userId":"955533378","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cody W","accountLink":"/user/id/955533378"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Loved the entire movie!","displayName":"Gary","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:21:17.059Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T21:28:35.882Z","user":{"userId":"5CDE70B1-7DB9-4D96-8030-50609C18F32F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Gary","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Chewy got his medal!","displayName":"Tony","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:21:02.575Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:21:02.575Z","user":{"userId":"C28E3CB0-FDA7-423A-87D9-DD1793F6FF6B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tony","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Must see !
