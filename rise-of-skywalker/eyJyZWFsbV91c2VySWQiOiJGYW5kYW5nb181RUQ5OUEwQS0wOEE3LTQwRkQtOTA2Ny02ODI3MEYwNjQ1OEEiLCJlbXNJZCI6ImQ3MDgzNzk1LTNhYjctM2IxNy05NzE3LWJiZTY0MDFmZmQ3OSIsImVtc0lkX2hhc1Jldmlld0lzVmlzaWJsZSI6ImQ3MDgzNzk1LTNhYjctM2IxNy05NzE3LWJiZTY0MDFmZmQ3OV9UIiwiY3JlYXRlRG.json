While I deeply enjoyed the film for what it is, I believe it does suffer from one flaw that could have been remedied, though probably to the detriment of the film to a wider general audience. The pacing of the film was a little off in the first act of the film, however as the film progresses it seems to get a grip and turns out to be a fantastic experience and a worthy contribution to the saga. This film earns the the rating I give it in my eyes as it is also a worthy closing to the Skywalker Saga and it creates a sense of completeness with the Saga.","displayName":"Trent C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:18:36.818Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:18:36.818Z","user":{"userId":"978453296","realm":"RT","displayName":"Trent C","accountLink":"/user/id/978453296"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Satisfying ending to a great saga.
