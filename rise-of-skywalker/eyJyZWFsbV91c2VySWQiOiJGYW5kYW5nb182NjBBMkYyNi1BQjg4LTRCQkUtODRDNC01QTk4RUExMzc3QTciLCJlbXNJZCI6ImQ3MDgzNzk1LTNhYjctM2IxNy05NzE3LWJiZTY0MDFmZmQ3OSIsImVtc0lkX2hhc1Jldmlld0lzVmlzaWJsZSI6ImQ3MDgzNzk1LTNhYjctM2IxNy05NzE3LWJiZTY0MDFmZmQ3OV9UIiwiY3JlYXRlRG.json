The movie effectively re-wrote the Jedi and Sith as gods rather than mystics. Plot holes were everywhere and character development took unsatisfying turns from episodes 8 and 9. Unfortunately, I feel that this movie has the potential to make Disney question whether they should be rolling out a full universe of movies a la the Marvel Universe.","displayName":"Michelle","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T04:31:19.052Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T04:31:19.052Z","user":{"userId":"7157ad2e-eb88-496c-9fc1-52302b587892","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michelle","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great way to bring an end to the saga, loved it!","displayName":"Josh","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T04:30:57.350Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T04:30:57.350Z","user":{"userId":"A574FB19-1A7D-46E1-A89E-81B2B10CA5FE","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Josh","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"the pacing was terrible,  too many potholes. it also destroys Anakins story. this whole trilogy was trash.","displayName":"Joseph P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T04:30:47.560Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T04:30:47.560Z","user":{"userId":"ED866547-1C03-4B31-B728-D108599FB31A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joseph P","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A wonderful conclusion to the series, and a beautiful and respectful goodbye to Carrie Fisher and her most memorable role.
