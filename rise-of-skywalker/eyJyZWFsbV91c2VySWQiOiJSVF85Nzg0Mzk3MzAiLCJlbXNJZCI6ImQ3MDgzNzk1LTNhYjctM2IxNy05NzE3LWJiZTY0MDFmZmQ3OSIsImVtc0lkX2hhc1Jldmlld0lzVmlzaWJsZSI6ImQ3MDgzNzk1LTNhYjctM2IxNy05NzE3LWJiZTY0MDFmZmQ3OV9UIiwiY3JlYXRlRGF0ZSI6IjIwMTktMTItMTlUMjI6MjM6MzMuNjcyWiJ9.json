The visual effects were stunning, pace was exciting and Driver's final performance as Kyle/Ben was fantastic. They also managed to give Fisher the complete and dignified end she deserved. There were nods and open reference to wider elements of canon that made it rich in all that lore that has made Star Wars so compelling. Not the ending everyone will have wanted but a fitting one.","displayName":"Kirstin B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:23:13.790Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:23:19.130Z","user":{"userId":"966977025","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kirstin B","accountLink":"/user/id/966977025"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I saw it today.
