Rise of Skywalker was messy, rushed, choppy...but this was inevitable when the film had to make up for two very poor predecessors; there was so little to work with yet so much to answer for, and although it wasnt a smooth ride, it certainly a fun and action-packed one. The movie also relied on nostalgia and fan-service, but is this really a bad thing? \n\nIt is a shame that this trilogy couldn't have had one director and team throughout, as if this trilogy was better-planned, Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker could have balanced content better. \n\nOverall however, it was awesome.","displayName":"Matthew P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3042016722476304/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:38:09.793Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:38:18.604Z","user":{"userId":"978442160","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew P","accountLink":"/user/id/978442160"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"First time watching.

Also I have realized that Abrams can't exploit John Williams's musical talent as a director. Music from VII and IX are less memorable than the rest of the saga's, incluiding VIII.","displayName":"lvaro S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/658756568/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:37:23.345Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:37:33.057Z","user":{"userId":"906002770","realm":"RT","displayName":"lvaro S","accountLink":"/user/id/906002770"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"A disjointed, mess of a film with no heart, emotion or an original idea.
