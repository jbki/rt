Put as simply as I can, this movie feels disrespectful.  It starts off at a breakneck pace, dropping bombshells and macguffins left and right with such speed that you never have a chance to understand or appreciate anything.  Beloved characters are killed, then immediately resurrected. Characters dead for years apparently aren't.  Character death means so little that one core character is 'murdered' while their fellows make quips.  One character is \"killed\" 3 times and \"resurrected\" twice.\n\nIf there's a plot hole or inconsistency, you can bet it will be plugged by a retcon introducing a major event that was never referred to or implied anywhere else, or they'll simply invent a new Force power.  Dragonball Z levels of power creep have our new users making legends like Yoda or Mace Windu looking like Padawans.  Remember the strain Yoda, one of the most powerful force sensitive individuals ever, showed when lifting a fighter out of a swamp or stopping a falling fuel canister?  Remember that when someone pulls a starship out of the sky on a whim.  \n\nThe bones for a good movie are here, and it has some intriguing ideas. But those ideas are patched together with so much nonsense that the whole thing falls apart.  I left the theater bewildered and spent the drive home trying to process what I'd watched.  If you don't care about star wars beyond flashy space battles and light sabers, this might scratch an itch.  But if you have any appreciation for the universe as a whole, the more you think about it, the angrier you'll get.","displayName":"Lindsay S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10156278807466524/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:21:44.286Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:23:39.156Z","user":{"userId":"978466356","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lindsay S","accountLink":"/user/id/978466356"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie... will go again","displayName":"gerald c","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:21:39.670Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:21:39.670Z","user":{"userId":"4B976999-CD0E-4E23-897B-ABF0C405CA77","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"gerald c","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"While it has the wonkiness of normal Star Wars, as a conclusion to the Skywalker Saga I felt the emotional weight of it all and felt it was a thrilling conclusion to the saga","displayName":"Chad E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001499525611/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:21:36.468Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:21:47.406Z","user":{"userId":"943233470","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chad E","accountLink":"/user/id/943233470"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"If you are a super serious SW fan that can't overlook errors/additions to the way the force works this probably isn't for you. If You are a casual SW fan or can put your critical mind in neutral and suspend disbelief, you may enjoy this movie.  Considering the seaming pile of wookie excrement that was the Last Jedi, I was skeptical weather Rise Of Skywalker could possibly end the series with a story I could live with. To my surprise they managed to do it. It's not going to make everyone happy, but its worth seeing. I'll probably see it again after Christmas.","displayName":"Mark H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1500695753377251/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:21:30.423Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T07:24:40.722Z","user":{"userId":"976975549","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark H","accountLink":"/user/id/976975549"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I thought the Movie was very good!!","displayName":"J D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:21:19.587Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:21:19.587Z","user":{"userId":"225a060f-41ec-4a59-97e1-d150ed3eeba3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"J D","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What an epic conclusion of this legacy story line we launched and cried, bonded with the audience, felt as if we too were apart of the legend of Star Wars.
