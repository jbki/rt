J.J. Abrams did an excellent job creating this fast past action film. The humor wasn’t as good as previous films but the acting, use of landscapes, and tying previous films in, made up for it. I have no idea why the critics disliked this film. I normally swear by the critics but in this case they are horribly wrong. Go see this movie and enjoy !!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T15:17:56.575Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T15:18:58.473Z","user":{"userId":"260258640","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260258640"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A wonderful film to wrap up the story of the Skywalkers.","displayName":"Jonathan B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T15:16:23.124Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T15:16:23.124Z","user":{"userId":"a3e58c66-dc4e-4396-8cb4-1a92086a4b7e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jonathan B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was full of action and twist and turns!
