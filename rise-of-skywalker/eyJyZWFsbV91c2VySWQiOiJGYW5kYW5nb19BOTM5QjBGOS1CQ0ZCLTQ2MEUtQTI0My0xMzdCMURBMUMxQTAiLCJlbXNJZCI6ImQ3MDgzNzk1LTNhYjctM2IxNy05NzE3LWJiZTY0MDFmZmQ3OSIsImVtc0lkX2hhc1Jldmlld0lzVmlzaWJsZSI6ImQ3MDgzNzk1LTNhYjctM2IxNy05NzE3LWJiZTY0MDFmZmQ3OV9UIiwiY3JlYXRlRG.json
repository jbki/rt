The movie had good pacing & action which will keep small children engaged.  The acting from the main 4 characters was fantastic.  JJ did a great job with a near impossible task.

Take it for what is and enjoy the ride.","displayName":"Bob S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10108773541594172/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:06:52.654Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:07:00.130Z","user":{"userId":"978454140","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bob S","accountLink":"/user/id/978454140"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I am so pleasantly surprised after reading and watching so much hate. The movie is an amazing feat considering how difficult is to conclude such a complicated story with so many character arcs. The visuals are striking and score is great too. Adam Driver is such a great actor and Daisy Ridley is not slouch either. Love the movie. Go see it and don't listen to the negative reviews. Nowadays people forget that Star Wars was always a movie to analyse less and enjoy more, just have fun, life is short, especially if you are not the Emperor :)","displayName":"Svetoslav P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:06:51.049Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:07:07.268Z","user":{"userId":"977800767","realm":"RT","displayName":"Svetoslav P","accountLink":"/user/id/977800767"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
