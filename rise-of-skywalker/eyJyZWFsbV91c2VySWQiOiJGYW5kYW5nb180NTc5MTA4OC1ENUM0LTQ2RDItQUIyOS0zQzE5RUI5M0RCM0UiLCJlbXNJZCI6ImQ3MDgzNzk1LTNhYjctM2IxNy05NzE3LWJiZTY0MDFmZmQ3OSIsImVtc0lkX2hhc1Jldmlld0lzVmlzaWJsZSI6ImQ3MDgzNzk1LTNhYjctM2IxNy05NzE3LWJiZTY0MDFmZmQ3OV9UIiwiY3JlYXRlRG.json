Sure there's a few things I would've done differently, but overall I thought it was a really good film. They had to wrap up the Saga in 1 movie, when in reality I feel like they needed two movies to do so. By this the pace of the movie goes really quick. But I give it a 8-9/10. I recommend. Good Star Wars film, go and enjoy!","displayName":"Max W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2439836239677580/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:00:06.907Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:00:17.548Z","user":{"userId":"978451105","realm":"RT","displayName":"Max W","accountLink":"/user/id/978451105"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Flawed but in the end very satisfying.

JJ Abrams didn't trust that we wouldn't need to see everyone before we said goodbye and I felt as a result there was too much jammed into one movie which prevented it from ever hitting a good rhythm.  We also had several new characters who you wanted to get to know but there just wasn't time.  It's a good resolve.  I wouldn't want that weight on my head.  Just didn't come away feeling pumped.","displayName":"Joseph M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:57:02.763Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:57:02.763Z","user":{"userId":"0cdab24d-f1d8-4383-9756-b22a863667b5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joseph M","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Idk if I could touch on it exactly, but it just felt like Star Wars, the knots were tied in the way I wanted them to be and the movie effect were beautiful all while sticking true to Star Wars and not making it something it isn't, from start to finish I was on the edge of my seat and even though it was obvious how it was going to end I still felt as if I had no idea what was coming, the more I thought about it the better it gets and not only did this movie excel, but it also made the other movies better and made some things that previously were in question make perfect sense. The emotional scenes in the movie were fluid and happened for the right reasons and nothing really felt forced(no pun intended). Truly loved what JJ did and when I walked out loving that movie as much I do I was excited and happy all around and for the people who didn't like it and didn't get to experience that feeling I feel sorry for, because it was truly wonderful.","displayName":"Braedon M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:56:58.066Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:57:00.526Z","user":{"userId":"978450157","realm":"RT","displayName":"Braedon M","accountLink":"/user/id/978450157"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"very good way of ending the story line of Luke, Leia, han...","displayName":"Christopher D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:56:50.525Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:56:50.525Z","user":{"userId":"3e5b676f-f10f-47b3-a990-3143728e76b1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Christopher D","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie shows what all fans wnated and perfectly enden the Skywalker saga","displayName":"Maximilian S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/495974824372917/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:56:43.030Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:57:05.640Z","user":{"userId":"978451084","realm":"RT","displayName":"Maximilian S","accountLink":"/user/id/978451084"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Una pel√≠cula entretenida, imperfecta pero muy nostalgica y pensada para los fans.","displayName":"Mauri C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:56:28.217Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:45:30.130Z","user":{"userId":"977607663","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mauri C","accountLink":"/user/id/977607663"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
