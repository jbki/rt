It seemed like J.J. Abrams was picking up the pieces of The Last Jedi and bringing it closer to his original vision for the sequel trilogy and I have to say that I did not mind where Abrams took it.  Rise Of Skywalker is definitely better than Last Jedi but I still am trying to decide if I like Rise Of Skywalker better than Force Awakens.  I would say that the sequel trilogy is my least favorite of the three Star Wars trilogies; it did not seem to have a end goal, each episode just felt like it still did not know where the saga would end up.  The overall plot was very similar to my favorite Star Wars comic book called Dark Empire and that did enhance my enjoyment of this Star Wars film.  However The Rise Of Skywalker was a fun ride that had a lot of cool fan service that made me happy.","displayName":"Adam J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:33:51.292Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T00:02:04.943Z","user":{"userId":"978043242","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adam J","accountLink":"/user/id/978043242"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Just when I thought you couldn't get any dumber, you go and do something like this... and totally redeem yourself!","displayName":"Eric P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:33:47.135Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:34:10.927Z","user":{"userId":"976950429","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eric P","accountLink":"/user/id/976950429"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Better than the other two Disney Star Wars movies, which is not saying much.","displayName":"Tatu72","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:33:45.484Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:33:45.484Z","user":{"userId":"C9E7F138-7D49-4605-B99F-2E33CEA90F04","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tatu72","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Was it perfect?
