The film was made with much more care and empathy for its legacy. Loads of fun, very dark at times, spine tingling and heart warming. The actors performances were vastly improved, particularly for Poe and Finn.

The movie starts at a breakneck pace. So many transitions to try tell as much story in one movie. It's too fast. There's too much exposition and there's so many unanswered questions at the end of the movie. Ultimately, it's an 'adequate movie' and I walked away satisfied. That's more than I can say for The Last Jedi.","displayName":"Dave G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1293310187481186/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:09:56.812Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:10:03.665Z","user":{"userId":"976942845","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dave G","accountLink":"/user/id/976942845"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Bloody great!
