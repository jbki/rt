This movie was incredible to me, I couldn't stop smiling for 10 minutes after leaving the Cinema as well as my sister. JJ, you wrapped this up well. I'm grateful for all my Star Wars memories. My childhood was amazing thanks to it and I know it will be to others for generations to come. May the force be with you, always.","displayName":"Hyperactive O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:02:40.203Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:02:40.203Z","user":{"userId":"978442023","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hyperactive O","accountLink":"/user/id/978442023"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The best of the three sequel movies. \nAfter the mess that was episode 8 I didnt really expect much,\nbut they really tied up some of the weird plot.\nThe jokes were good, the score was great and there were lots of references to other SW media.

The interactions between kylo and Rey are well done and continue to impress.\n\nThe end showcases JJ Abrams desire to just make things bigger and flashier with no real thought about making sense or being satisfying, but the ending somewhat lands with the arc coming to a relatively satisfying conclusion.\n\nOverall, worth a watch but certainly in the rankings for one of the worse star wars movies made.","displayName":"Mike W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10151988691061786/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:58:18.060Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:58:22.394Z","user":{"userId":"976220414","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike W","accountLink":"/user/id/976220414"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It was visually very  nice, good movie. Story might have been a little too fast at the start. Some characters felt underused, however, if you were to use them all the movie might be too long. So I get it. \n\nIf you're looking for the next deep expansive emotional movie, might want to skip it. This is Star Wars, a tale of good vs evil in space. With Lasers! and Lightsabers! and Aliens. It's a fun movie. Not to be watched Solo (mind the pun), but in the sequence it was made. Watch the others first.","displayName":"Kenneth V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:58:10.243Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:58:13.885Z","user":{"userId":"978441993","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kenneth V","accountLink":"/user/id/978441993"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I am a hater of the new star wars.  However JJ was handed a huge turd.  A massive pile of poo.  And to be fair he has polished this turd to the point it IS a watchable movie. I think it is better than The last Jedi and the force awakens.  It has massive problems.  But considering the mess Rian Johnson left on the floor JJ was never going to be able to really fix it.  However he did not a bad job.  A turd but a well dressed up polished and frankly enjoyable one.","displayName":"Tony B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10155135601986900/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:56:53.126Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:57:00.887Z","user":{"userId":"977032551","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tony B","accountLink":"/user/id/977032551"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The CGI was good, and the fan-service wasn't excessive and it didn't feel forced most of the time.
