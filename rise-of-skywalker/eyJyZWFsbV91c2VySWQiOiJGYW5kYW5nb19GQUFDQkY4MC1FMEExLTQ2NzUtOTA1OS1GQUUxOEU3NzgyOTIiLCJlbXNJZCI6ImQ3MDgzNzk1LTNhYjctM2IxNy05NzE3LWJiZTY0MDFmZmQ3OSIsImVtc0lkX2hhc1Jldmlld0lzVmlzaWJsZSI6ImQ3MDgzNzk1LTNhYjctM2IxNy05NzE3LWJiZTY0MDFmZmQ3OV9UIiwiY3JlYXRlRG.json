So much hurriedly, without explanation and debunking the previous chapter.  The central trio has talented actors who don't impose themselves because of so many inconsistencies in a lazy screenplay that invents a situation to drag the film ever further into mediocrity.  Star Wars deserves so much more than that, The Mandalorian and Rogue One are there to prove it.","displayName":"Rodrigo T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100003576739527/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T22:37:10.545Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T22:37:17.208Z","user":{"userId":"929330772","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rodrigo T","accountLink":"/user/id/929330772"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent wrap up to a great story!","displayName":"James","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T22:36:54.577Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T22:36:54.577Z","user":{"userId":"23DCF5D3-DB29-4639-ABCD-ABD64D2E2366","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"James","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I donâ€™t even care what the critics say, the movie is EPIC!","displayName":"Fawn P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T22:36:52.461Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T22:36:52.461Z","user":{"userId":"771E450D-5CA6-4AFF-93A2-580340B81AB8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Fawn P","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Special effects were really good.

Finally a deeper look into the Sith and the power of the Force. I've been highly critical of the last 3 Star Wars Films, always infusing a political or agenda driven narrative of today's issues rather than just keeping the sole focus on story. Is the movie  perfect? No- but it keeps a good tempo; not getting us sidetracked with new characters and overly dramatic scenes.","displayName":"Adrian H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/694355129/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T22:34:50.670Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T22:35:03.916Z","user":{"userId":"933576180","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adrian H","accountLink":"/user/id/933576180"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"It was ~90 minutes of movie in 150 Minutes and felt longer then that.
