Alot of the questions from Force Awakens were answered and corrected some of the issues from the Last Jedi.  My only critique was the scene with Kylo Ren and Rey near the end.

But definitely a Star Wars movie I would watch again.","displayName":"Uy V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T06:46:56.947Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T06:46:56.947Z","user":{"userId":"69f79159-d678-4558-bf1a-8c98ed71c0b0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Uy V","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Too long, not 1 of my favorites.
