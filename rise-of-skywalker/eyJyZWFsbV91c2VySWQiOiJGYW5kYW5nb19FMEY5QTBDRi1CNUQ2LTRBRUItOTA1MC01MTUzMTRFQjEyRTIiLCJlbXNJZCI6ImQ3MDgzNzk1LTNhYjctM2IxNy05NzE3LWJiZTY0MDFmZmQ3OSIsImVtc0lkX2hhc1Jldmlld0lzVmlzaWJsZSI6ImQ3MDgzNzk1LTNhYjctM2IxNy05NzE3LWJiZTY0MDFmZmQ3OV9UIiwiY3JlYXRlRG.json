However, I watched the movie and really enjoyed the experience. Having seen all 8 previous movies, this movie was satisfying and tied up most story lines very well.  Out of 100 I would give this a 94 overall Action and story were great and old friends made it into the final cut. Great job overall and thanks for a wonderful movie experience.","displayName":"Jimmy L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T05:48:08.248Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T05:48:08.248Z","user":{"userId":"92c57ee7-2122-4e69-9ad8-d7ca58a8f0be","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jimmy L","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!
