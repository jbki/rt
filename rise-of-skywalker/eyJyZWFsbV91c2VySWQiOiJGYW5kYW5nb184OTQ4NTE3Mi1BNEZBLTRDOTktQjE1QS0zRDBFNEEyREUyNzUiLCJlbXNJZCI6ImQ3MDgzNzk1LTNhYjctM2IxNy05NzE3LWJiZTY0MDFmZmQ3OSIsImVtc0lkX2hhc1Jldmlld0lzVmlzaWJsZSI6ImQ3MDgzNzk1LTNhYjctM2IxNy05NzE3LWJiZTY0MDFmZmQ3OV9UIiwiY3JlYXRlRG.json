They cover a lot of ground in this film, but never take the time to let each discovery sit with the characters impacted (and the audience). There are moments of goodness in the movie, but this is the first time I walked away from a Star Wars moving feeling there were no great moment(s) to pull me back in for more viewings which is truly disappointing. While not awful, I walk away from the wrap of a saga that has been in my life as far as I can remember just feeling like the true Star Wars fan deserved better.","displayName":"Mike","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T14:04:10.364Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T14:04:10.364Z","user":{"userId":"962CFAAE-A62D-4D3C-8CCD-F342D7C81527","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mike","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was a good way to close out the trilogy. some parts were a little too campy.
