A really great ending to an amazing saga. It gives clarity to a lot of things, while also giving potholes to those fans who love the comics! For those who aren't as involved, it could be a small amount confusing, but the story is indeed worth even the time of the fans who aren't as involved with the saga. It continued the love and action, in depth story  and awe aspects from the previous six movies, but brought a fresher story. Whether you're a Prequels fan, a O.T fan, or a sequels fan, this is a must watch Star Wars Movie!","displayName":"Noah  V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:11:04.037Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:11:16.723Z","user":{"userId":"978437926","realm":"RT","displayName":"Noah  V","accountLink":"/user/id/978437926"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It wasn't perfect, of course.

Lesson be told do not create a trilogy without an overarching story in mind through all 3 movies ESPECIALLY when you are doing a sequel trilogy to the most iconic trilogy of all time in the original Star Wars movies. I could always rewatch the original Star Wars and I could always go back and re-watch the 4 phases of the Marvel universe. However, I don’t look forward to going back and re-visiting this trilogy This movie felt like one big rollercoaster ride. It was entertaining but you don’t feel attached to anything going on because everything is moving so fast to wrap up the loose ends Abrams created in Force Awakens while creating huge plot holes that leave us with new unanswered questions. Scorsese should’ve made his comments against this movie but not Marvel. At least Marvel had planned narratives from point A to B and character building and it lands in its final installment of Endgame. When Endgame was over there was loud clapping, you felt the emotion in the audience, people were crying, and all the big moments were earned and executed well. At the end of the showing opening night in my theater, there were few awkward claps, no emotion felt, people were sitting there unsure what to think and all the big moments were not earned and weightless. This movie seriously felt like a 90s action movie of story telling. A lot of action but weird weird decisions and lazy story telling. The only good things in this was all the acting (Daisy Ridley is outstanding), the music, and the cinematography. Other than that, this in-cohesive trilogy should’ve been left in a galaxy far far away.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:10:17.803Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:10:17.803Z","user":{"userId":"973911709","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/973911709"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"As a true Star Wars geek who loved both the originals and prequels, I liked this movie.

The frantic undoing and rebuilding of the story Rian Johnson created to fit JJ Abrams's bland tunnel vision made the whole experience unpleasant.  \n\nAll of the unique elements brought into the Star Wars universe were sacrificed to build a narrative that once again follows the same story beats of the original trilogy.  However, unlike The Force Awakens, there wasn't any room left for a fun romp through the Star Wars universe.  It was just waves of scene transitions designed to move the audience to the next abandonment of the established story.","displayName":"Robert L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/76200203/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:09:46.234Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:09:53.557Z","user":{"userId":"784725377","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert L","accountLink":"/user/id/784725377"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Pulls the franchise together nicely, ignore the critics.
