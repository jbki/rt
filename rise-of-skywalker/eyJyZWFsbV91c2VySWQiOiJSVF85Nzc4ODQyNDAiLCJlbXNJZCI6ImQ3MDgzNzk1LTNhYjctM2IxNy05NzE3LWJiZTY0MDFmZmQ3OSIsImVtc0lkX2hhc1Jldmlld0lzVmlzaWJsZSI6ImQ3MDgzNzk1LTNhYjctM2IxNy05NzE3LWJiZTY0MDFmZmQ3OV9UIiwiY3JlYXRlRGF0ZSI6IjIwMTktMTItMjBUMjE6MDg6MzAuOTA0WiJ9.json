I think many will not because it's a fantasy movie that wants you accept things without explanation. Just like we did with the OT.

But again this film wasn't made for them, it was made for the fans. \"The Rise of Skywalker\" displays the widest use of \"the force\" that has ever been seen in the films. It also has many heart touching and heart breaking moments that will have fans on a roller coaster of emotions.  Finally, the movie ends the Skywalker saga in a satisfying and memorable way.","displayName":"Devin T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2178682925584823/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:08:07.280Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:08:59.225Z","user":{"userId":"978050251","realm":"RT","displayName":"Devin T","accountLink":"/user/id/978050251"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"loved everything about it","displayName":"Casey","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:07:55.084Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:07:55.084Z","user":{"userId":"399F4455-C9CE-4FAA-9C63-330E3DFA00A7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Casey","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It would have been better to have Abrams direct all 3.

I went in not expecting much and left the theater very satisfied.  There are moments that truly capture Star Wars.  Rey is a fully fleshed out character in this film and she truly does have a powerful arc.  This is the same for Kylo Ren who in my opinion has been the strongest character in this series of films. \n\nLuke is handled well and I got to see the character I wanted since Return of the Jedi. \n\nIts a fun movie and a beautiful sendoff to these new characters while paying a beautiful homage to what has come before.  Do I see it as the end of the Skywalker Saga? No.  That ended with episode 6.  This is about the children of our heroes and their story and this film is wonderful conclusion.","displayName":"Daniel M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/162554131782054/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:07:34.172Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:07:38.613Z","user":{"userId":"978453092","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel M","accountLink":"/user/id/978453092"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"was pretty good. but a good way to end it .","displayName":"Jimmy O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:07:32.224Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:07:32.224Z","user":{"userId":"BDCA6EB5-0293-4A98-9025-137C5DF3CD9A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jimmy O","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie plays with the emotions like no other.

It had a frenetic pace and deftly mined the previous films in the Skywalker Saga for inspiration and story telling.
