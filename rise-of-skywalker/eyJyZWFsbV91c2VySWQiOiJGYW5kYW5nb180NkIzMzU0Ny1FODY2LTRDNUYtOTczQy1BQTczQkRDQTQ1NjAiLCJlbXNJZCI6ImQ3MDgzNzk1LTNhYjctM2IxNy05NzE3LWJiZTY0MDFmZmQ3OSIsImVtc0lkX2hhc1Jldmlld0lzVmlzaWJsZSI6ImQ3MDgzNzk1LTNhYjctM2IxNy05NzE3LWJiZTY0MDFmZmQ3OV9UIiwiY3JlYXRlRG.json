I don't read reviews prior to watching movies like Star Wars. I watch, form my own opinion, and then see how my opinion matches the other audience reviews. That being said, I LOVED Rise of Skywalker. Sure, not all plot lines and character arcs are nailed, but that doesn't stop RoS from being non-stop fun. Abrams did the most with what Johnson left him with. From breathtaking scenery to brilliant acting from the core cast, RoS is, in my opinion, one of the best installments in the franchise.","displayName":"Joshua","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:45:52.563Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:45:52.563Z","user":{"userId":"e3246528-0498-4e8f-9387-7f20343dc0d1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joshua","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A thorough finish to great saga.","displayName":"Karen F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:45:43.498Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:45:43.498Z","user":{"userId":"530823d3-a434-4f3e-b0eb-d4adf50e485f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Karen F","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A fitting conclusion to the Skywalker Saga.

It is an entertaining ride that feels to be complete of fan service and course correction from a meandering storyline that is incoherent in the trilogy. The worst part is that it does zero for character development with the exception of Rey, and makes you extremely frustrated with the possibilities that could have been with the new trilogy.","displayName":"Steven H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/157400216/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:40:12.619Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:40:25.639Z","user":{"userId":"798185996","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steven H","accountLink":"/user/id/798185996"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"}]}
