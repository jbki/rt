Half the movie they tried to cater to everyone, the other half they spent trying to fix Rian Johnson's mess - \"The Last Jedi\". They are turning the Jedi and Sith into gods....a far cry from Lightsaber wielding Jedi in the prequels.  Why they still need lightsabers is a mystery with all their superpowers now.   Not sure how you can call this a \"Skywalker\" saga when it had nothing to do with Skywalkers.  NOTHING.

By trying to surprise the audience with weird plot twist it just created a cringe-fest.
