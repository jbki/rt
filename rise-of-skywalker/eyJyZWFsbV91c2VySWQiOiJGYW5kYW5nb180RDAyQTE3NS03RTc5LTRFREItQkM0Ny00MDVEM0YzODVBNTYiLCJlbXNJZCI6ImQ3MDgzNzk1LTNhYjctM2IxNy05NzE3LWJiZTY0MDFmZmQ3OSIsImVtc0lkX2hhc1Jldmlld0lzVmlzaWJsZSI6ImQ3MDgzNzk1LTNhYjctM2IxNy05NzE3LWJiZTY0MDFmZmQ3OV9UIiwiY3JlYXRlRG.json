The biggest plot surprise in movie history was in The Empire Strikes Back. I guess nothing can ever compare but I wish something shocking had happened this time around. Nonetheless, I did enjoy this finale in the trilogy and recommend every fan to watch it.","displayName":"Jade Rose","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T03:43:44.076Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T03:43:44.076Z","user":{"userId":"ECABE52D-7A5E-42B2-AADE-28068C174B7F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jade Rose","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"What I heard about the movie was horrible, but when I saw it in the theater, I loved it.

It may not bring a lot that is new to the table but it enriches the saga and pays honor to what has come before. The hate this movie is getting is undeserved. Disney's most obvious problem with its sequel trilogy is it's lack of written plan. Giving it lesser direction than previous installments. But I believe J. J. Abrams did the absolute best he could in trying to tie together what he started in 7. Let alone the conclusion of all 9 films. But when rewatching the original trilogy and sequel trilogy, you will see that this new group of films is not alone in its flaws. And if that's what you're looking for when going in to see this movie. That's all your going to find. But if you go in optimistic, you won't be disappointed by the close of this 40 year old story and it's formidable foe.","displayName":"Christopher M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T02:41:43.015Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T16:01:40.510Z","user":{"userId":"978451560","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christopher M","accountLink":"/user/id/978451560"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was a fine ending to the cronicole that started for me at a drive-in in 1977 watching the adventures of Luke, Lia, Han, and Chewi.
