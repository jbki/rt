In the beginning, too many of the scenes made me feel like time hadnt passed. Similar/same sets were used from much older movies without changes that would be inherent through the years. There were no changes in the type of action. Seemed like it had all the same CGI. The story line was very good, but the cinematography was the same.","displayName":"Jacqui c","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T14:54:28.801Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T14:54:28.801Z","user":{"userId":"8c701a73-fe74-48a5-a3bf-9d767701e06e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jacqui c","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Fun the end.

So, it felt a little rushed.  But it also felt like Star Wars again.  Grand space adventure story that doesn't crap all over the original trilogy characters.  I definitely recommend this movie.","displayName":"Kevin T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/646857827/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-31T14:48:54.095Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T14:49:12.824Z","user":{"userId":"792710240","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kevin T","accountLink":"/user/id/792710240"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"The plot was too random and formulaic.","displayName":"JoshRey","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T14:48:15.118Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T14:48:15.118Z","user":{"userId":"f3adc6e9-1def-4ff8-aa78-b16f0d95d07a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"JoshRey","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Slow.

They have just not been able to recreate the magic they had in the first of this series.  The character Finn was confusing.  Does he have the force or not.  Some scenes it gives you the impression he has powers but it is never clear.  Plus if I heard him call out R-E-Y one more time I might have yelled myself.  \nOlder characters returning was great and the movie had plenty of action.  Good but not their best.","displayName":"Raad J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T14:46:51.976Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T14:46:51.976Z","user":{"userId":"c6646a35-31e5-492d-a5d7-784c0f24851c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Raad J","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very well done Mr Abrams.","displayName":"Rebecca M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T14:44:49.662Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T14:44:49.662Z","user":{"userId":"f3c8e961-d4c4-40a3-a3fc-64c2b37ff0e2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rebecca M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"}]}
