If you are going into this movie to have a fun time, you will be happy. This movie kept me grinning from ear to ear the whole way through. However, as someone who enjoyed the Last Jedi, I can't help but saying that I'm kind of disappointed. To start, the first act was incredibly awkward. For me, the course correction JJ Abrams included isn't the problem, the real problem is how quickly it all happened within the first act. Another problem I had with the first act was the over-use of McGuffins. Rey, Poe, and Finn needed to get one McGuffin to find another McGuffin that would lead to a McGuffin leading to Palpatine. Speaking of Palpatine, the plot hole involving the fact that Kylo Ren went to the temple at the very beginning was frustrating, to say the least. After that, the movie finally began warming up on me. Following the numerous frustrating jumps between planets and quests, we go to Endor. If anything is great about this movie, it's the relationship between Rey and Kylo. Truly, it's at the best it's been in this trilogy. But, the reveal of Rey's parents was kind of disappointing honestly. There's too much praise for this movie saying that it's unpredictable, I have to disagree. This movie, I found, to be extremely predictable, including Rey's heritage. But again, this is NOT A NEGATIVE REVIEW. There were things I really enjoyed about this movie as well. I thought that some of the fan service actually worked nicely with the (somewhat convoluted) plot. Han's return, Luke's force ghost powers, Ben's redemption, and Chewbacca's metal were all big highlights. But, so many of those great moments ended up getting lost to me with huge gaping plot holes (i.e. where did Palpatine's army come from, how did he survive, etc.) and rushed plot lines. But again, it's a Star Wars movie. If anything is wrong with Star Wars right now, it's the fans. Everyone holds Star Wars to an incredibly high standard, what people need to realize is that this is a kids movie. The kids of each generation fall in love with their respective trilogy. 3.5/5 It's a fun movie but too many problems with the plot keep the movie from being something better.","displayName":"Logan G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:48:38.154Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:48:46.030Z","user":{"userId":"977720040","realm":"RT","displayName":"Logan G","accountLink":"/user/id/977720040"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie was great!
