Nostalgia may be a powerful weapon at Disney's side, but it wasn't enough to carry such an epic movie that never grew, changed, took risks or even excited me. Battles are all well and good, but the whole thing felt hollow at the end. The last Sykwalker is dead, and the message that the only way to redeem oneself is through dying was just the icing on a badly baked cake. I hope Disney feels ashamed of themselves and J.J. Abrams even more so.","displayName":"sara  b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:55:53.102Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:56:52.390Z","user":{"userId":"978450987","realm":"RT","displayName":"sara  b","accountLink":"/user/id/978450987"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent movie.

However there were too many plot holes and they did a poor job with proper exposition. There were many times I furrowed my brow in confusion. So many lost opportunities in the film. Great cast and some great fan service but overall I was underwhelmed with the story.","displayName":"Matt E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:52:57.471Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:52:59.877Z","user":{"userId":"978450959","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt E","accountLink":"/user/id/978450959"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was a good send off to the sequel trilogy.
