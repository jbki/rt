The romance was a little off-putting, for all characters involved. The final battle was terrible and really leaves you wanting more from the exchange. \n\nNot a movie I would care to rewatch.","displayName":"Rise of Ben Skywalker","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T15:39:52.392Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T15:39:52.392Z","user":{"userId":"33caca21-13eb-4b3a-869c-cbb304744e83","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rise of Ben Skywalker","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great Movie.
