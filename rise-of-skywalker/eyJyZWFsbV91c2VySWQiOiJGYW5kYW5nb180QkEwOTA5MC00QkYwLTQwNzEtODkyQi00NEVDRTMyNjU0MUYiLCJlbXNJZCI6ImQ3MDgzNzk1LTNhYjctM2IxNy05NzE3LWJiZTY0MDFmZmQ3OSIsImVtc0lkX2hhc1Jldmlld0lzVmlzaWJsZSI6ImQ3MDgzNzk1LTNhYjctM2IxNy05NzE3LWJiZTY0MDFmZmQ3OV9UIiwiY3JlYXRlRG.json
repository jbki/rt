After the abomination that was The Last Jedi, and seeing numerous negative reviews of this movie, I was very worried about how I was going to feel about this movie. And yes, there are some pretty Mary Sue-ish moments and I think it could have been done better, but for what it was, I really enjoyed it. There was exciting and kick-ass moments sprinkled throughout, I thought (not going into spoilers) what they did with Leia was really effective, and I thought the end throwdown was fairly satisfying. Everyone in the cast was great. Overall, not the best Star Wars movie, but far better than I was expecting. I would definitely watch it again.","displayName":"Caleb R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-24T00:50:21.587Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T21:58:55.549Z","user":{"userId":"977994165","realm":"RT","displayName":"Caleb R","accountLink":"/user/id/977994165"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"This movie don't have plot","displayName":"Filipe M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T00:50:00.500Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T02:01:26.836Z","user":{"userId":"978471995","realm":"RT","displayName":"Filipe M","accountLink":"/user/id/978471995"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Very dissapointing.

The failures were on par with Phantom Menace. Easily the worst of all 9 movies, making The Last Jedi the best by default of the last three. For once, the top critics and I agree on a poor rating; 55% is still too generous though. No character development, too convoluted, and once again, lost opportunities. The fans that loved it are probably too young to even remember how this story began. The last slap in the face to common sense was Rey calling herself a Skywalker at the end. What a vomit inducing, gut-wrenching finale. I wish I never saw any of them.

It was exceptionally better than The Last Jedi and answered a lot of lingering questions from the Force Awakens. It was a fun ride and was the first time I was emotionally invested in the three main characters. A perfect addition to the Skywalker saga and I am glad that JJ righted many questionable choices that the director of the previous movie made. Also I notice a huge discrepancy between critic and general audience reviews of recent movies, I don’t know why that is the case but people should avoid listening to critics since they don’t seem to have a pulse on what many others would perceive as an enjoyable movie.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T23:51:09.225Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T23:51:09.225Z","user":{"userId":"976954792","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976954792"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie.
