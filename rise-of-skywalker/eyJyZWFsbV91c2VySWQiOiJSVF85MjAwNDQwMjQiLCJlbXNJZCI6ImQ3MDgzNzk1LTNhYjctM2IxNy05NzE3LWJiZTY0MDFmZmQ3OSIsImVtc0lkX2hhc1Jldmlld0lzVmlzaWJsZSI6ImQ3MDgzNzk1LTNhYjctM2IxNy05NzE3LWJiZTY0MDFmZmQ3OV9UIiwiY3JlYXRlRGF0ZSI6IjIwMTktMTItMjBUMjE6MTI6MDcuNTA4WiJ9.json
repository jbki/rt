It felt like a roller coaster of emotions going at light-speed, due to how it seemed to pack so much into the film, as it clearly attempted to fix the Last Jedi's mistakes, while wrapping up the sequel trilogy in a satisfying manner. Unfortunately, the sequel trilogy's characters were never as compelling as the ones we have come to cherish from the original six films. The major issue with the sequel trilogy, overall, is that there was no overarching plan set up prior to the Force Awakens, leaving the three-part story feeling messy and without direction. After the classic ending of Return of the Jedi, the sequel trilogy failed to support its reason for existing, as it did not carry forward the old character's stories in a meaningful manner and did not give the audience much of a reason to care about the new characters. That being said, JJ appears to have done the best he could with what he had to work with.","displayName":"Josh W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001287496347/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:11:58.711Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:12:13.374Z","user":{"userId":"936809300","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josh W","accountLink":"/user/id/936809300"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This is pure garbage","displayName":"Can T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1074082249619191/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:11:41.158Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:11:45.705Z","user":{"userId":"978453264","realm":"RT","displayName":"Can T","accountLink":"/user/id/978453264"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Every plot decision, every retcon to basically invalidate TLJ, every convoluted story thread just to get the pieces where JJ Abrams wanted them — I truly disliked them all. \n\nIt felt like bad fan fiction, focus-grouped to hell and back and proved that Disney had no plan for this trilogy from the start. It felt almost childish in a way how this film went back to erase parts of TLJ that were not well received, as though we're watching Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams flip each other off over three movies.\n\nThe pacing was also a nightmare. Rise of Skywalker whips through the first act of the movie at lightning speed just to remake Episode 8. \n\nIt's a shame because these characters are all fun, they have amazing chemistry, the actors are great (Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are phenomenal) and I'm dying to see their adventures. The banter here is the closest to matching that wonderful original trilogy pulpy feel. They deserved a better movie.\n\nThe first two films in this sequel trilogy had done a great job of setting them up to tell a new, interesting story. Instead, what we got feels like a kid playing with his toys in his bedroom, mashing together old characters and plotlines. It's as though this was engineered in a lab to maximize the response from obsessive \"fan culture\" and avoid the same backlash that hit TLJ, not to actually say anything with meaning. \n\nAfter this film I'm left wondering what the sequel trilogy — hell, even the entire saga — was really about.\n\nThe most tragic thing of all: I felt nothing the entire way through. Rise of Skywalker left me as cold as Hoth. And as a die hard Star Wars fan, that's the saddest thing of all... Oh well. At least there's still the Mandalorian!","displayName":"Paul S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:11:40.478Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:11:43.009Z","user":{"userId":"978453155","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paul S","accountLink":"/user/id/978453155"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A lot going on but easy to follow.
