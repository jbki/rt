I came into this movie with VERY low expectations, however it managed to wow me several times. It was unbelievably fast paced though . This movie should have been at least an hour longer than it was. There are still things that didnâ€™t quite make sense, but for a Star Wars movie it was pretty good. I will definitely be going to re-see it multiple times.","displayName":"Caleb M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:20:25.600Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:20:25.600Z","user":{"userId":"164BD058-7DD4-431B-B67A-77D388358556","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Caleb M","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Better than the last 2.

Beautiful cinematic work, however this is one more movie that was obviously made for money. The comedy is awful, there's a bunch of love triangles that make no sense. The movie creates more holes then it fixes, honestly it ruined many sacrifices and characters. Disney made al of the extended universe non cannon just to steal most of their ideas and make it cannon again.
