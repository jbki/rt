If you are a Star Wars enthusiast like myself, don't listen to the critics' negativity they've no idea what makes for a wonderful, exciting Star Wars adventure! It's fun, fantastic science-fantasy romp that ties the loose ends together nicely and gives a thrilling, heartfelt conclusion to the saga we've been following for the past 42 years! I have loved what Disney has done with Star Wars, personally, and The Rise of Skywalker didn't disappoint me. I've got a good feeling that you may feel the same!
