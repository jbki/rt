Yes, I wished a force ghost Anakin showed up for maybe a minute or 2, but, at least they got his voice in there with all of the other Jedi to help guide Rey and power her back up with all of their energy, I loved that scene. You never get bored while watching the movie. The pace is fast and could be better but I love the constant action. I was very satisfied with Ben Solo's arc and one of the best scenes of the movie was him seeing a memory of his dad, Han. That got my eyes watery. This film overall felt complete to me while making me laugh, shocked, sad, and overall happy and just content period. It's my 4th favorite of the 9 Star Wars Skywalker Saga films and my favorite of the Sequel Trilogy films.","displayName":"Grant W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T21:59:48.125Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:01:07.525Z","user":{"userId":"978475337","realm":"RT","displayName":"Grant W","accountLink":"/user/id/978475337"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Best of the three new ones.
