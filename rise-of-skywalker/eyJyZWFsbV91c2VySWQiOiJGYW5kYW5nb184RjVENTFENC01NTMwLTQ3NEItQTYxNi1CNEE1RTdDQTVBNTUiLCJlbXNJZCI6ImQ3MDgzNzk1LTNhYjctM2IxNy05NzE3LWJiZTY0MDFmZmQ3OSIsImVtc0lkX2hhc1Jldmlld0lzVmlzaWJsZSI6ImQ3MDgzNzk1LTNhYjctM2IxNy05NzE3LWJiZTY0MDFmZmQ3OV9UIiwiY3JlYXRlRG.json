The absurdly fast pacing does not work in a film with very little stakes as a videogame-plot first act. The Hail Mary plot points and introduction of concepts without any second thought or development became tiring very quickly. Certainly not the best case scenario for the conclusion of this trilogy.","displayName":"Griffin C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T15:54:54.833Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T15:54:56.416Z","user":{"userId":"978487078","realm":"RT","displayName":"Griffin C","accountLink":"/user/id/978487078"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was very good!!!  Dispute all the naysayers, I recommend seeing it!  I thought J.J. did an excellent job pulling everything together after the total hack job Rian Johnson did with The Last Jedi.  Being a total Star Wars geek, I would have given this one 5 stars but it did at times feel rushed.  It still leaves a couple of unanswered questions.
