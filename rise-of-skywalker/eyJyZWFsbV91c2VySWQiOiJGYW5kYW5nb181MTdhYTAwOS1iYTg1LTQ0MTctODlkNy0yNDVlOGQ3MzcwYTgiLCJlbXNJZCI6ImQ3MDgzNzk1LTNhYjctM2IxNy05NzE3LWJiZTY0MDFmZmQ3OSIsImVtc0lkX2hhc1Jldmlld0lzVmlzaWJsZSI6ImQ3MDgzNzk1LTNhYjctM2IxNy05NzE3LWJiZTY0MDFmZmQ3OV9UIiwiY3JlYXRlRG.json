The desire to make Rey into Harry Potter is still there, down to the idea that she wouldn’t exist without the ultimate bad guy being essential for her creation. Even the sappy ending does not leave her independent.","displayName":"Joseph V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T18:20:55.951Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T18:20:55.951Z","user":{"userId":"29EEFE97-6CED-48AB-93D8-1C80659223CF","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joseph V","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"liked the special effects a lot.

The last two movies were entertaining and reignited my love of star wars. This one was a predictable, cheesy, cliche filled 2 and a half hour disaster. The film makers felt the need to resurrect practically everyone who has ever been in a Star Wars movie. Disney rushed to release this movie before christmas and because of that the spent no time or thought on writing a good, entertaining story and the result was a $275 million mess. Deeply disappointing.","displayName":"Finlay L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T18:16:40.924Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T18:17:18.847Z","user":{"userId":"978482921","realm":"RT","displayName":"Finlay L","accountLink":"/user/id/978482921"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The movie is confuse, exaggerated in fan services, and its finale is very poor.","displayName":"Laura B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10207934540078580/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T18:16:31.554Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T18:16:46.560Z","user":{"userId":"978498801","realm":"RT","displayName":"Laura B","accountLink":"/user/id/978498801"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved the movie and felt it followed the original Star Wars.","displayName":"SJD","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T18:14:37.523Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T18:14:37.741Z","user":{"userId":"519cc840-d4ec-4210-b859-e50b83c11f89","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"SJD","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It was a great wrap up!","displayName":"Mary Beth D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T18:13:06.247Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T18:13:06.247Z","user":{"userId":"37343b41-d099-4954-83b6-35e812edadee","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mary Beth D","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was a good tying up of loose ends for the saga.\nIt wont please everyone.
