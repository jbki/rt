Every character was treated like garbage by the writers who either forgot their arcs setup in the previous movies or just didn’t care. Choppy editing and an over abundance of needless fan service sours whatever joy I might of had watching this film and the ending left me asking “what was the point of it all?” Children were crying leaving the theater. Because of a movie supposedly aimed at children.

I person my liked it a lot minus some silly scenes.  Reviving people seemed a little over board. The healing I can somewhat accept but yeah the bringing back the dead was a little too overboard for me. \nOther than that I accepted the story they told. Many might not have agree with it but I saw the same thing with the TV show Lost.
