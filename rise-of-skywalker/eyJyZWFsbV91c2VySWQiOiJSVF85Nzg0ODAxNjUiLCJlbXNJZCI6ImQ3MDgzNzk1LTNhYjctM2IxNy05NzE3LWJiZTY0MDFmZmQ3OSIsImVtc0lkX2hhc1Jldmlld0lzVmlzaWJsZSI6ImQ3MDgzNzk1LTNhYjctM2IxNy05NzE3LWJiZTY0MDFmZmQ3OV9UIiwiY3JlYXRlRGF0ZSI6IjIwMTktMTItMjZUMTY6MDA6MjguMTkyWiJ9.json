It was fast paced but not so much that it was confusing. plot holes from the previous film were fixed with an excellent story. I had my doubts with this movie but J. J. Abrams really cleans it up from the last film. I canâ€™t emphasize enough how good of a film this was I definitely plan to see it again.","displayName":"Facebook U","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:00:15.139Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:00:15.139Z","user":{"userId":"388B6BCE-1158-4C91-A7F9-C3F1F6F4FA8D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Facebook U","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It scratches all the itches.

The movie was not perfect, but when Star Wars came out it was fast past, fun, joyful, and kept you on the edge of your seat. This is what TROS did for me. Many of the storylines from TLJ still made it through but after a year, our characters have learned different perspectives about those events. Thanks JJ for reeling this in and give us a fun last adventure with the Skywalker Saga!!!","displayName":"Adam R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10112799443739078/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T15:57:08.909Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T15:57:14.283Z","user":{"userId":"978480153","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adam R","accountLink":"/user/id/978480153"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I'm a star wars fiend, have been since the first movies. I have to say that the only downside is this felt kind of like 2 movies crammed into one and should have probably been given a little more running time to work it all in there, but other than that, they did an excellent job trying to bring all the threads of this last trilogy together. I rather enjoyed the whole adventure, which is more than I can say for some of the absurdities in the last movie.","displayName":"Christopher S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T15:56:38.827Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T15:56:38.827Z","user":{"userId":"a630b68a-1fa2-46c4-aaf5-1b7d5f82e82e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Christopher S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it.
