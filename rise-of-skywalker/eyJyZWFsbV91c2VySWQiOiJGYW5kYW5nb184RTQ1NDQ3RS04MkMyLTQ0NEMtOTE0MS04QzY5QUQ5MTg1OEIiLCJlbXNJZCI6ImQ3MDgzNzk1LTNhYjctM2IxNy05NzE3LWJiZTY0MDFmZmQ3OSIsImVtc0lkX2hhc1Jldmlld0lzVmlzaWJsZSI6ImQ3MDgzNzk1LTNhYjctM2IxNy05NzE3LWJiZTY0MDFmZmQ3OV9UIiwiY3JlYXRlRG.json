The villains in this movie were barely constructed ( general Pryde), or Emperor Palpatine who just appears without much of a explanation how (other than \" the dark side did it\" kind of explanation. General Hux is a spy for no real reason other than he's unhappy. Every star destroyer has death star capability which takes away from the awesomeness of the original Death Star And none of the star destroyers can do anything unless commanded by the main star destroyer which Finn knows where to find because he \"feels it\". What?!!!! Kylo Ren is a complete wimp. The movie depends on people being satisfied by the walk down memory lane because the plot of this movie is horrible. This will be the last Star Wars movie I pay to see in the theater. Star Wars is truly dead.","displayName":"Daniel J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10216245031707528/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:55:40.861Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:55:53.640Z","user":{"userId":"978466268","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel J","accountLink":"/user/id/978466268"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"was much better than last jedi, but wasn't great only good.  could've been better battle with emperor at end.","displayName":"Jim","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:55:35.786Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:55:35.786Z","user":{"userId":"e59f05b0-cfd7-4a29-a218-8da073b2febc","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jim","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"BEN SOLO DESERVED BETTER!!!!","displayName":"Haleigh S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2756382364407665/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:55:24.243Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:55:45.673Z","user":{"userId":"978466337","realm":"RT","displayName":"Haleigh S","accountLink":"/user/id/978466337"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Everything that drove the plot forward was in the just for the sake of plot. Nothing is explained as to how she related to others. Also with the ending the title of Rise of Skywalker is not very fitting.
