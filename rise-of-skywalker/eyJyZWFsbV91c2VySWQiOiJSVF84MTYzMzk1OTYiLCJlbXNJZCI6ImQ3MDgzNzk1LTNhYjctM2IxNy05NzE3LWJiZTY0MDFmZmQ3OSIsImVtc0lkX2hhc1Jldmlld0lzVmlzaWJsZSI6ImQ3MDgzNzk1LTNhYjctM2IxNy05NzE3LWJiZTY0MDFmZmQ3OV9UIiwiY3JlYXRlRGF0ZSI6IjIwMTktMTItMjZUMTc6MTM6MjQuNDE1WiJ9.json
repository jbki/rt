This whole movie squandered the last four years of hard work to tell the space epic that is Star Wars. If people hated GoT season 8, they should have a similar reaction to this installment of Star Wars. Totally missed the landing. And to blame it on Rian Johnson, saying that this film was a reaction to his, ignores the fact that the studio and JJ Abrams didn't have a plan in sight on how to finish the trilogy locked in 6 years ago with they started this journey.","displayName":"Dustin F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000571108001/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:08:48.793Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:09:04.700Z","user":{"userId":"926399104","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dustin F","accountLink":"/user/id/926399104"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"They did a pretty good job with what the last movie left for them which wasnâ€™t very good.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:07:29.327Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:07:29.327Z","user":{"userId":"260249884","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260249884"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing visual journey that contains wonderful new environments for the seasoned star wars fan.
