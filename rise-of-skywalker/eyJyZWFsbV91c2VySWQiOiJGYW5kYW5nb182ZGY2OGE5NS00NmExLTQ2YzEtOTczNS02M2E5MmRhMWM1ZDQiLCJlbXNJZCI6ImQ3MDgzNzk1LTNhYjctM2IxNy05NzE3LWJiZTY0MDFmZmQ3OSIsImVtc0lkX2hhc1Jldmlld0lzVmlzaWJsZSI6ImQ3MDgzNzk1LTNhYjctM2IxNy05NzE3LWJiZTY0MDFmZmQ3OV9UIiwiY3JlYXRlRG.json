Thankfully retcons most of the terrible choices of TLJ.  I found myself enjoying most of the story, but often it just reminded me how good the sequel trilogy could have been had it been properly planned and executed.  The story feels rushed and there are a lot of unresolved plot elements, but overall it tells a good story.  It's not the best Star Wars movie ever, but it's definitely not the worst.  If you hated TLJ, you'll probably like TROS.  If you liked TLJ, then don't bother seeing TROS.","displayName":"Joel S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T01:34:22.951Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T01:34:26.545Z","user":{"userId":"976388272","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joel S","accountLink":"/user/id/976388272"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was good, but not remarkable...","displayName":"Reagan M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T01:34:15.838Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T01:34:15.838Z","user":{"userId":"E1E3A0CE-3858-4A02-91AD-4B1015ABADA8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Reagan M","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Started out a little empty.
