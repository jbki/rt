For me this was a bloated, confused mess of a movie whose first 30 minutes were an exposition dump and the rest was driven by heretofore unexplained or unexamined plot devices that propelled the story to a merciful and convenient end. The action bits are nice, and there were a few genuinely funny moments, but otherwise it felt like a fan-service movie with no real point or purpose to it other than to be the last in a story arc.","displayName":"Kurtis Y","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:10:02.125Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:10:02.125Z","user":{"userId":"C40E33E4-C8E2-4EB8-A013-41C577ABAB3C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kurtis Y","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"It should have been better.

The scene when Kylo Ren brings back Rey reminded me of the scene from Cocoon 2. When the Emperor sucked the life out of Rey and Kylo, yeah, that was from the Mummy. The end scene when everyone showed up, that was End Game. Couple those things with cheesy dialogue, an awful performance from Mark Hammel, and a pointless cameo from Harrison Ford, and you got another horrible Star Wars movie. Luckily, it wasn’t as bad as The Last Jedi, which will probably go down as the worse Star Wars Movie next to the prequels....maybe even worse.","displayName":"Brian M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:08:45.224Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:08:45.224Z","user":{"userId":"A734D499-7C4E-47CD-B0FA-5A8F81B34B15","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Brian M","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved the movie!

Episode IX was perfect. It wraps up the entire saga cleanly. There's lots of dark stuff going on, some real treats for the fans and thrilling action scenes throughout. All the feels for these characters that I love. The acting is fantastic as well, Kylo and Rey are brought to life with strong performances by Driver and Ridley.
