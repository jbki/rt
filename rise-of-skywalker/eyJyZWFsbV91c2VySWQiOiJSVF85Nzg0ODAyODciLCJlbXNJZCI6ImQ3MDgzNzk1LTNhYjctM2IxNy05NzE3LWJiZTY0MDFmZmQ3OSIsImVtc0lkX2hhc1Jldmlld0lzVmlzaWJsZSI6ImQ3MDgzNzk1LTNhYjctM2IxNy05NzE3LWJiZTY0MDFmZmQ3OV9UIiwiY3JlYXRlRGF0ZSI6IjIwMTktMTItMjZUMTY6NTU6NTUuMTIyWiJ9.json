Fans wanted different after TFA and got TLJ. Hated TLJ because it's too different or more accurately, too smart for them. Disney decides to cave to fan service and feed them what they want, predictability. Fan reviews shows they love it while critics wanted more of what they loved about TLJ rather than JJ and company playing it safe! And thus they are split! This is funny! But whatever, I LOVED this trilogy and I love this film! TLJ is still a superior film but man, people, this isn't art house, this is space fantasy! Stop thinking too hard over Star Wars... because you haters are so in the minority!","displayName":"Tim R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:54:36.750Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T06:25:47.308Z","user":{"userId":"868573311","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tim R","accountLink":"/user/id/868573311"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I loved this \"ending\" to the skywalker saga.
