Great action and story line plot twist. Never disappoints! Loved seeing everyone from the last forty years again. I hate to see an end of an era for my generation. A beautiful tribute to Carrie Fisher and I was glad to see her daughter in the movie. Missed Yoda.  Loved the surprise ending.  Don't miss this movie.  I saw the first one when I was 18 years old.  I always looked forward to the next movie saw the last one at 61 years old yesterday. As a diehard Star Wars fan it is bittersweet. I cried..... Has to be seen in 3D!","displayName":"Joanna S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T05:32:28.747Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T05:32:28.747Z","user":{"userId":"c8a0f51e-4790-47d8-b3a5-8ab9f53d87e4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joanna S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"There were some surprises, sad moments, funny moments, happy moments.  Definitely better than Last Jedi and a good end to the Skywalker saga, but maybe not \"all that\" due probably to all the hype and expectations.
