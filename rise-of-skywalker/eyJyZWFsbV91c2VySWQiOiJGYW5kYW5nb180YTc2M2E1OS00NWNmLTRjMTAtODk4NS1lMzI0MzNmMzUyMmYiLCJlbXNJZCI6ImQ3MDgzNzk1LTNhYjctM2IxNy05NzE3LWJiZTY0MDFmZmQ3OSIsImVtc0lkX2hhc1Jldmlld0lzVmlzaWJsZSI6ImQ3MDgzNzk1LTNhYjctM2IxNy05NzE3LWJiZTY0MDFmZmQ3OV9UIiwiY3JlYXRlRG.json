The movie is perfectly entertaining and has many if not all of the great components that would delight even the most critical fan of Star Wars. I think the expectation that each movie has to out-do it's predecessor has gotten us to a place that is a bit insane. The movie is just fine. There are surprises, lots of dazzling effects, and has a good plot. Sure NOT EVERYONE is going to love it, but I am big fan of Star Wars, and it was perfect. Go see it. It's far more worthwhile than about 80% of the other junk they are calling movies these days.","displayName":"Nathan P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T15:28:26.956Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T15:28:26.956Z","user":{"userId":"b1b555d9-956c-45e5-b8cd-21e0f9d736b7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Nathan P","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was fantastic!
