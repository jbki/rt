Fun throughout.  A few things that could make those who worship at the alter upset.  Considering the task of tying all the threads together, it was much better than I thought it would be.  Interesting in that it more or less made irrelevant the entire last movie.  The last movie I saw in the theatre was Endgame and it was certainly better than that disaster.","displayName":"J R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T08:44:24.979Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T08:44:24.979Z","user":{"userId":"978479364","realm":"RT","displayName":"J R","accountLink":"/user/id/978479364"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Nowhere near the greatest of the initial trilogy but still high on nostalgia.
