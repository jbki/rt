The previous episode left too many questions and the answers in this movie instead of being impressive, they end up being a glimpse into the past but with a lousy handling of the story being repetitive, just as The Force Awakens was. The development of the characters is poor since instead they exalt them for this closure, they end up being illogical and flat to have illogical motivations, meaningless situations or worse, some leave them without conclusion. This has been a disastrous trilogy where no chapter could be connected by the previous one and the mistake was to please an audience instead of bothering to tell a new and progressive story through its filmmakers.","displayName":"Eduardo S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/618893803/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:06:45.670Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:06:52.351Z","user":{"userId":"845527482","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eduardo S","accountLink":"/user/id/845527482"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"All my questions were answered.

If the next trilogy doesent offer us something totally new and unseen before then the whole franchise will slowly die a painful death, people dont want to keep buying the same regurgitated material over and over again.","displayName":"Bill W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10153198662333284/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:05:18.435Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:05:22.947Z","user":{"userId":"838833162","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bill W","accountLink":"/user/id/838833162"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
