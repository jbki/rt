Sadly, I ended up being right. It was definitely better than TLJ, but that wasn't too high a standard. J.J. Abrams tried to clean up the mess that he had made and that Rian Johnson had brought to an unfathomable low, and the fact that he tried is a credit to him. But intentions were not enough. The end result was a hurried, cluttered mix of nostalgia and exaggerated novelties, of poor storytelling and an attempt on character development, of fan service and financial tactics.\n\nThe nostalgia factor implicated forcibly bringing back characters that were supposed to have been gone for good, trying to appeal to fans' sentimentality. But it ended up being ridiculous and buffoon-ish. And where TLJ introduced Force abilities that made Leia look like Mary Poppins, this movie gave some characters abilities that made them look like Jesus Christ wannabes. TLJ left me wondering at first why didn't the Rebellion never hyperspaced both Death Stars using a cruiser, but after not much consideration I realized how foolish that was for the sake of intelligence and logic. This one left me wondering at first why didn't Obi-Wan Force-healed his dying master, but after not much consideration either I realized how foolish that was too.\n\nNot everything was bad, of course. The new worlds featured here were varied and original, something that I truly value in a Star Wars story. The battle and fight sequences were mostly well choreographed and performed. CGI was used a lot, but within the acceptable limits of a movie set in space. TLJ's stupid jokes were kept to a minimum and comedic relief was only sparingly used. Most actors did an commendable job, but Daisy Ridley's effort is worth highlighting, maybe not Academy Award deserving, but she certainly did very good.\n\nI don't know how well this movie will be received in the economic jackpot that the entertainment industry hopes to strike in the United States. It didn't go very well with critics, but those who matter are fans that may or may not go to the movies to watch it for a second or third time. On my part, I will wait till it hits digital release or novelization, whichever comes first, in order to catch up with any small details that I may have missed.\n\nAnd only time will tell what the conclusion of the Skywalker Saga will mean for this Disney-led franchise.","displayName":"Judah-Ben M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001472258701/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:50:56.848Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:00:57.116Z","user":{"userId":"930927602","realm":"RT","displayName":"Judah-Ben M","accountLink":"/user/id/930927602"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Movie felt very rushed, but there was a lot to pack in.

It will definitely anger those who have disliked Episodes 7 & 8, but for those of us who can forgive the faults of all the preceding films, this is more than just a satisfying conclusion to the saga.  It has so many moments of pure joy, I can easily forgive a few odd pacing issues, and the unexplained return of a major character.\n\nIf you loved all of the Skywalker, you should love this.  It isn't perfect, but none of the others were.  If you hated episodes 7 or 8, them just skip this one.  The fandom doesn't need you to add any more negativity.  Go watch Cats instead.","displayName":"Shaun N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3016171985059651/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:49:09.270Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:49:14.838Z","user":{"userId":"978442190","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shaun N","accountLink":"/user/id/978442190"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Esse filme é incrível,um desenvolvimento de história bem empolgante, batalhas boas, um final muito nostálgico e puro emocionante e um encerramento muito digno.","displayName":"Rennan A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:47:28.802Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:47:28.802Z","user":{"userId":"978233195","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rennan A","accountLink":"/user/id/978233195"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"}]}
