I could hardly imagine a more poorly conceived and executed final act for this set of nine movies.  If you can turn your brain all the way off and just enjoy the nostalgia-packed visuals without concerning yourself with the plot, or characters, or thematic concepts, then there might be something here for you to enjoy.  Otherwise, I'd recommend waiting until it comes to a streaming service to be disappointed by it.","displayName":"Hrothgar H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T21:07:53.984Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T21:07:53.984Z","user":{"userId":"978494927","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hrothgar H","accountLink":"/user/id/978494927"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I prefer Jar Jar Binks spin off over this...","displayName":"Sebastian S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3367496216657348/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T21:07:46.842Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T21:07:59.347Z","user":{"userId":"978494941","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sebastian S","accountLink":"/user/id/978494941"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The most traumatically disappointing movie I have ever experienced. \n\n- Can they even be consistent with their own universe? \n- Palpatine doesn't know that revealing his evil plan openly to the main character is a bad idea.\n- Rey being a Palpatine has no implications on the story whatsoever, nobody cares. \n- When the hell did Palpatine have his son? The numbers don't add up at all. \n- Kylo Ren doesn't know that trying to run over an armed Jedi with a starfighter is a terrible plan. \n- Rey just killed Chewie? Don't worry Rey, it wasn't your fault. Leia will definitely understand. No one is sad. \n- Hey, lemme kill you with my sword because you abandoned me on this horrible planet to join the resistance. Oh nevermind, your friend with a lightsaber is pretty cool so I'll give you everything I have worked for immediately. Also, I secretly have a crush on you because you're really hot. \n- Rey is a selfish uninteresting character that somehow ends up embodying the whole Jedi order in pure anime fashion. \n- Kylo Ren summons a TIE fighter out of his butt, flies to the \"LEGENDARY SITH PLANET\" of Hexa whatever that every fan knows, ready to fight the undead Emperor of the Sith armed only with his fists and good intentions. \n- He dies without contributing whatsoever to the fight. The fact that he is the last Skywalker is irrelevant. \n- ETC.\n- ETC. ETC. \n\nThe story is lazy, badly written and has no soul at all. If it didn't have the Star Wars logo it would be something two people in the whole world would go see at the cinema, probably by mistake.\n\nAs a Star Wars fan and someone who didn't even think The Force Awakes and Last Jedi were that bad, there's no scene that describes what I felt better than the one where Rey is ready to throw Anakin's lightsaber and the past 40 years of the franchise to the flames\njust to be stopped by an angry frustrated ghost of Luke Skywalker, called back from the dead to try to salvage what's already a damn disaster. But not even a force ghost can save what's already dead.","displayName":"Gabriel M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3235979343139236/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-31T21:07:18.034Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T21:07:52.712Z","user":{"userId":"978494903","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gabriel M","accountLink":"/user/id/978494903"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The end has come & I enjoyed it.","displayName":"Solomon W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T21:06:50.921Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T21:06:57.126Z","user":{"userId":"784040881","realm":"RT","displayName":"Solomon W","accountLink":"/user/id/784040881"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Worth watching, better than the last 2 episodes","displayName":"Christian","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T21:06:32.226Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T21:06:32.226Z","user":{"userId":"5D0F9BED-7891-4A2D-9683-E5DF887E3F59","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Christian","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"}]}
