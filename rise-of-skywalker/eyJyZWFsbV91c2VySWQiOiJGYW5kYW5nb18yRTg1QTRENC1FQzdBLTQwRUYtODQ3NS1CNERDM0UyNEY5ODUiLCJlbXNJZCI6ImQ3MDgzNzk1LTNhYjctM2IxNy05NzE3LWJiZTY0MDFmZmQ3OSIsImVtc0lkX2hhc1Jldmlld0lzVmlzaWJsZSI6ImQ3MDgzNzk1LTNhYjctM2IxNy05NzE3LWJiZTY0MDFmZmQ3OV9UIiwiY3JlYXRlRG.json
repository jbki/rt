Yikes. My thoughts after my first viewing were that the film was hollow, unnecessarily frantic, soulless, and incongruous with the other two in the saga. It's so clear and such a tragedy that Disney didn't map out the overarching story of the sequel trilogy from the beginning. Absurd plot holes and ridiculous plot points you just have to accept as truth with no merit. The actors barely got to act; they just had seconds to spit out lines. There are very few takes that last longer than 10 seconds. So much sacrificed for fan service. From a filmmaking perspective, it feels like an objectively bad movie. However, several of the Star Wars movies are objectively bad but are still deeply, deeply loved, and after my second viewing I predict this is where I'll end up. I'm so disappointed, because I thought after all this time they'd at least be able to crank out an objectively good movie. The characters, actors, and fans all deserved better, but at least we have (some) answers now.","displayName":"Veg S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:11:02.027Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:11:02.027Z","user":{"userId":"978461233","realm":"RT","displayName":"Veg S","accountLink":"/user/id/978461233"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Much better than The Last Jedi but that ainâ€™t saying much.
