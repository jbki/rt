An emotional roller coaster, a lot of things you have to take with a grain of salt. Dont let the small plot holes ruin this great movie for you. If they went into every single detail, this would be a 5 hour movie. Maybe some spin offs can come from it! Adam Driver is amazing. And my favorite, the droids are wonderfully lighthearted comic relief.","displayName":"Selena","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T06:25:38.385Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T06:25:38.385Z","user":{"userId":"5a9b4af8-0cc7-42d3-b557-ae4f9a4371eb","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Selena","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Too many superfluous scenes which didnt add to the plot line.
