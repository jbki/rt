Lots of Easter eggs for the true Star Wars fan. Only difficult parts were strange dialogue to fit in Carrie Fisher scenes, which is totally understandable and acceptable, and weird transitions to fix Rian Johnson screwups. Lots of action and a healthy dose of sentimentality.","displayName":"MasterYaya","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:14:30.216Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:14:30.216Z","user":{"userId":"AF9CCABF-3E3F-4D39-B380-51EB9BD83121","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"MasterYaya","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Despite odd pacing at the start, the emperor being clearly used just for marketing, the length, high concentration of plot and occasional wooden dialogue, JJ Abrams does the best he could to not only balance the strong conflicting ideas and interests of the force awakens and the last jedi, but to also conclude a nine film, multiple decade long saga with an impossible to completely please fanbase and a high bar of original films to live up to. Yes these last three films don't add anything new to the saga and only exist for money, yes the change of writers and directors means that characters and ideas are juggled around constantly (see twists/Kylo's helmet/Finn's ever changing potential love interests), but this film had enough to be immensely enjoyable; characters who've previously been treated potenitally badly are all great now (especially Rey who's now a badass and Kylo Ren who had the best arc of the movie), the plot was suspenseful and exciting, the music was on point as always, and it was full of scenes to make old fans smile. A solid enjoyable star wars film in my books that doesn't deserve all the hate it receives.\n\n(Also Carrie Fischer's sad passing is handled beautifully and not too jarringly as well üëç)","displayName":"Harry T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:14:21.594Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:14:26.229Z","user":{"userId":"977753228","realm":"RT","displayName":"Harry T","accountLink":"/user/id/977753228"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great film and loved the storyline","displayName":"Kathy D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:14:05.570Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:14:05.570Z","user":{"userId":"7AEE80F8-51C9-48E0-991D-F95254E13AA4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kathy D","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great end to the Skywalker Saga.","displayName":"Phillip J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000513753962/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:14:00.741Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:14:12.062Z","user":{"userId":"950742664","realm":"RT","displayName":"Phillip J","accountLink":"/user/id/950742664"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Star Wars! What a journey! I remember seeing the original Star Wars blockbuster in 1977. It changed the whole idea about going to movies. Today, this film was a completely appropriate ending to a saga.

No matter whether you appreciate the writers and their turn with Luke, Leia, Han and the rest, this movie tops it all well.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:13:54.192Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:13:54.192Z","user":{"userId":"849163681","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/849163681"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Terrible attempt to salvage a trilogy that was doomed since the second movie.
