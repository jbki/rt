The third installment of this series shows the Most powerful form of Jedi and all the different chapters. The first half of the film feels like a little Scooby Dooish, but makes up by building a fantastic story arch. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley have really come together on this one and come together in a powerful way in this story.","displayName":"Jonathan G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:54:50.944Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:54:56.976Z","user":{"userId":"978245705","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonathan G","accountLink":"/user/id/978245705"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Having seen them all within the first day of release and some more than once, I found it a fitting tribute to the saga that brought back balance to the force for the time being.  That said, as there are Star Wars releases scheduled for 2022, 24 and 26, I guess we will have to wait and see if that holds up.  It's always easy for some to find something to be picky about.  Lighten up, it is entertainment.","displayName":"John R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:54:48.479Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:54:48.479Z","user":{"userId":"f0d49fda-0441-4315-ad93-23cbe589d97b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"John R","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I felt like a kid again.
