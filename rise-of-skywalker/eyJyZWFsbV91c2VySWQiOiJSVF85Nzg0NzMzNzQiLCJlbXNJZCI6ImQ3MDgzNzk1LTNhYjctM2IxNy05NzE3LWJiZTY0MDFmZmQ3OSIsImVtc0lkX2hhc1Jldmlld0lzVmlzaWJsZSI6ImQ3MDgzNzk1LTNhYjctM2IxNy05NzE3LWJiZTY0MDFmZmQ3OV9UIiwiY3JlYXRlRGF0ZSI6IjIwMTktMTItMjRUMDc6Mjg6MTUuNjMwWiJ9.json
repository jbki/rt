TLJ makes me furious to watch so i dont. This movie has its problems but it at least feels like a Star Wars movie. It makes it so no one ever has to watch TLJ. Seriously TLJ can be skipped and nothings lost. Again theres some problems with the story & how/why Palpatine plan is & why he's executing it in such a way: the announcement, why not kill Kylo, why Rey, why not save himself in the beginning instead of wanting Rey to kill him, etc. but overall i can rewatch & enjoy so 6.5/10 is my rating. Not a big fan of the Force Heal...brings up A LIT OF QUESTIONS. Qui-Gon, Schmi Skywalker etc. Still a solid GOOD movie. Far from great & not very good but im at peace with the sequel trilogy. Disney should of planned the entire trilogy before first scene was shot on TFA. Maybe next series they'll learned a lesson.","displayName":"John M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T07:25:21.963Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T07:34:30.939Z","user":{"userId":"964885096","realm":"RT","displayName":"John M","accountLink":"/user/id/964885096"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"They played it too safe. Aroused no intense emotions or feelings. Too lighthearted to be taken seriously and things are undone immediately after they are done.

The plot may feel a little familiar, but get over your nostalgia. Even if the plot isn’t that original, the acting is far superior to the originals and so are the special effects. Great movie that had plenty of tear jerking scenes. Watch the movie with the expectation of good acting and special effects and you won’t be disappointed. Loved this movie.","displayName":"Nick","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T07:22:37.062Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T07:22:37.062Z","user":{"userId":"606BCD18-5518-4C7C-B7D5-D8243A00F240","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Nick","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Absolutely fantastic","displayName":"Blake","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T07:22:36.223Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T07:22:36.223Z","user":{"userId":"B0CD748A-E114-4AEC-A161-0528F51DB6EB","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Blake","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Better than I thought it would be","displayName":"cfhemsley","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T07:22:01.364Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T07:22:01.364Z","user":{"userId":"25739b51-ed7d-4295-add3-ecef5e083f1b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"cfhemsley","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Quite possibly the worst movie I've seen all year.","displayName":"Nick P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1350510028/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T07:21:47.664Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T07:21:51.449Z","user":{"userId":"824288954","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nick P","accountLink":"/user/id/824288954"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Godly saber battles.
