It does not matter if you loved the franchise from the start or if you have no nostalgia factor at all, we all have to agree the writing should have been much better.  This whole ep 7 on saga was poorly done and it feels like everyone is trying their best with what they were given but that all amounts to a cool looking movie that in my opinion weakens the franchise and sci-fi as a whole in the same way the last season of Game of Thrones hurt \"Game of Thrones\" and the fantasy genre as a whole or the last episode of \"Sopranos\" weakened that show and the mob genre as a whole. There were no claps at the end of this movie....just a few groans and upset fans and I saw this opening weekend...","displayName":"Michael F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/694165774/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T23:14:13.303Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T23:14:18.518Z","user":{"userId":"816944386","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael F","accountLink":"/user/id/816944386"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great ending to a trilogy","displayName":"Bob","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T23:13:55.000Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T23:13:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"54B68309-BBAF-49F5-8D2D-5AA94C62834A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bob","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was amazing!
