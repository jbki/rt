There was no plan for this trilogy and they had an agenda that took priority over the story. Just lazy writing and non stop failed attempts at member berries. While I enjoy Rogue one and The Mandalorian,  Disney ruined the Skywalker story. This was a horrible ending to a horrible trilogy.","displayName":"Ian V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10155876431280790/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T17:20:56.056Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T17:21:56.490Z","user":{"userId":"970968932","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ian V","accountLink":"/user/id/970968932"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very entertaining.
