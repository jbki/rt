I just basked in the joy of the end of a 40+ year friendship without the burden of needing to know what \"wasn't canon\" or \"but...physics.\" I feel lucky to have been on the ride since 1977, and literally sat through every last credit of RoS -- to prolong the experience and the warm feeling as long as possible. Too much to love to get distracted by minutiae, so I WILLINGLY suspended all disbelief one last time. :)","displayName":"Jim H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157163599605592/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:22:03.482Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:22:09.309Z","user":{"userId":"976382574","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jim H","accountLink":"/user/id/976382574"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"JJ does his best with what he was dealt","displayName":"Patrick R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000088880854/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:21:52.473Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:21:58.990Z","user":{"userId":"945726833","realm":"RT","displayName":"Patrick R","accountLink":"/user/id/945726833"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Kept my attention the whole time!!!

Perhaps the fastest-paced of the Skywalker Saga installments, with a narrative speed that matched and amplified the intensity of its' protagonists and their desires. Additionally, the handling of Rey's character arc and it's conclusion was excellent, and did much to depart from the series' male-centric past. Definitely in my top 5 Star Wars films (Definitely behind episodes 5 and 4, on par with 6 and 7, slightly preferred to 8 and Rogue One).","displayName":"Kelsey K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000441714672/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:16:03.970Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:19:16.964Z","user":{"userId":"893608011","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kelsey K","accountLink":"/user/id/893608011"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good quality family entertainment.
