Let's just replace him with a different evil overlord!). Even Kylo's mask had to be brought back for some reason (and Anakin's lightsaber; did anyone even bother to explain how it was suddenly fine after getting ripped apart in the previous movie?)\n\nThe pacing is rushed and all over the place from the moment the opening credits roll. Nothing is built up, the dialogue is clunky and filled with painful exposition, and the interactions between characters are shallow and stagnant. Even moments that should feel impactful are kept from having any sort of emotional resonance because of how abruptly they end. JJ doesn't give the characters any room to react before the tone does a 180 and we're on to the next scene.\n\nThe only character JJ didn't do dirt in this film was Poe, who I found extremely charming and likable, and had a lot of enjoyable moments. Rey and Kylo have very thin and badly written character arcs, while Finn doesn't seem to get a character arc at all in this one.\n\nWhat a disappointing end to the Skywalker saga.","displayName":"Simone M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:53:20.768Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:53:26.887Z","user":{"userId":"978452835","realm":"RT","displayName":"Simone M","accountLink":"/user/id/978452835"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Enjoyable, good, not greatness, but enjoyable.

Plot threads from the previous films were left dangling conspicuously or ignored altogether in favor of densely packed action scenes, chaotically rushed through. The audience was not given ample time to sit in one conflict and mull over the emotional implications before being thrust into the next. Meaningful character development was abandoned almost entirely as JJ Abrams elected, instead, to add MORE unnecessary plot and ideas that did not coalesce or even end up having isolated impacts on his audience. I was willing to put the obvious issues (i.e. the film structure and emotionally devoid planet-hopping) aside if we were at least given a happy ending or a jumping-off point that was exciting for future post-TROS stories. However, one of the main characters had a meaningless \"meaningful\" death that derailed the motifs of balance, redemption, forgiveness, and hope. I can no longer enjoy any future material knowing that his struggle was in vain and his character arc was so thoroughly disregarded. I feel as though we, as viewers, were egregiously mislead into believing that there would be a satisfactory ending for this character. \n\nThe conclusion doesn't feel like Lucasfilm. It doesn't feel like Disney, and it most certainly doesn't feel like Star Wars. The filmmakers tried desperately to force an emotional response out of the audience through borderline cruel subversion, but I'm afraid the tears shed and the anger felt by viewers regarding this final installment have nothing to do with the storytelling itself and everything to do with the narrative betrayal we are now being forced to come to terms with. Game of Thrones, congrats. You've officially been dethroned as the worst ending to a multimillion dollar franchise. I have never bestowed upon a film a more deserving review of a 1/2 star. \n\nSince TFA, I believed in this story. I continued to believe in and rally behind it after TLJ, a film I very much enjoyed. But this was truly the end of my faith in the trilogy. The end of an era in the most disappointing way I could've imagined.\n\n\"If the boy and girl walk off into the sunset hand-in-hand in the last scene, it adds 10 million to the box office.\" -George Lucas","displayName":"Tess R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001817663312/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:53:12.379Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:53:18.016Z","user":{"userId":"915389984","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tess R","accountLink":"/user/id/915389984"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
