This movie is visually beautiful and the actors (Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac) really give their best with what they have, truly an amazing cast. That being said, it's an entertaining mess of a movie. Has no cohesion with the greater story, it is not creative at all, tons of plotholes that will be fleshed out with additional material (books, comics, etc.) which only proves it was rushed. Abrams made a big f* u movie to The Last Jedi. The End of the Trilogy is fun to watch, but upon reflection it is a big mess.","displayName":"Eduardo  D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T03:42:46.132Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T20:57:12.576Z","user":{"userId":"978162671","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eduardo  D","accountLink":"/user/id/978162671"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved it!

I left the theatre feeling like I had no idea what just happened. I don't understand why so many weird decisions were made for the final film in the trilogy. This movie is sensory overload and lacked emotional depth. The focus on destroying the previous film was not only obvious but insulting for those of us who enjoyed it. Overall, this movie really felt like a let down and wasted potential if both Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley.","displayName":"Robyn d","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/569080323/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T03:32:30.051Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T18:55:36.244Z","user":{"userId":"798622657","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robyn d","accountLink":"/user/id/798622657"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie.

There were definitely moments where there were some conclusions, many of which were fan services. Despite trying to fix some of the mess from \"The Last Jedi\", the film was still underwhelming with pacing problems and a not so satisfactory ending. Even if the movie tried to bring some moment of excitement and cheer, there was not enough development or time to allow us to immerse within a particular moment to have those strong feelings or reactions. This could have honestly been made into a two part ending with just how they tried to squeeze everything, especially as they tried to so call develop Poe's past and some of the newer characters added into the finale. \n\nNow, let me say this. I always felt that this series/saga was always about the Skywalkers. I even rewatched the whole series before TROS to remember and celebrate some of the best moments of Star Wars, especially from the original trilogy. However, this current trilogy did not meet the expectations or the understanding of such story or celebration. Therefore, what questions can be answered? \n\nWas it better than \"The Last Jedi\"? Definitely! Did it have answers for many fan questions and theories? Mostly yes! Did it have a satisfactory ending to a great saga? Unfortunately, I do not believe so. I wish I could have enjoyed the finale as much as I wanted to. Unfortunately, this is the finale that we have to settle with.","displayName":"Raisa R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000712686194/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T03:30:52.430Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:29:57.780Z","user":{"userId":"901509082","realm":"RT","displayName":"Raisa R","accountLink":"/user/id/901509082"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The movie is just a mess.
