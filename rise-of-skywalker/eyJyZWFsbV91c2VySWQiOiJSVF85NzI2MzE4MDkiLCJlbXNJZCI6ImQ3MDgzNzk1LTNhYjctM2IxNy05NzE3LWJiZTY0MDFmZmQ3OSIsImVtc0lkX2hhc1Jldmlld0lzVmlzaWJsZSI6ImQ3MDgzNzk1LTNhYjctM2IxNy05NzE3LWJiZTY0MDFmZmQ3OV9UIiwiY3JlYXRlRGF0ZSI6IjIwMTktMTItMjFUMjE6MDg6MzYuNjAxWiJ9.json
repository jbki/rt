Honestly they put too much effort to make the worst movie of the nine (even when jar jar binks happened).

Give it time to breath JJ, what's the rush? Too many new characters. Who really cares what happens in the sky during the beautiful Sith scenes. Finn became a useless character as this trilogy moved along. Shoulda combined Finn and Poe into 1 character.
