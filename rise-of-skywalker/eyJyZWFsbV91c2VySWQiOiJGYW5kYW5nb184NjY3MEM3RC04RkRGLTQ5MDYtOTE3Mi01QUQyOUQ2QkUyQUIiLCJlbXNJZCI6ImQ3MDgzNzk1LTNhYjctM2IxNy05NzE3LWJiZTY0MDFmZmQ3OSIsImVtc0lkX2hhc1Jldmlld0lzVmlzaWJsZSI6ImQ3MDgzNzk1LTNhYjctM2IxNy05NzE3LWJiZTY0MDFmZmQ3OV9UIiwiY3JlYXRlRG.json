Needed more plot. \nGood graphics and acting. I'm a huge Star Wars fan. I thought there would be more meat to this one. I think the heart and soul of the \" force\" never really came through.

Very bad. It's a gish gallop of bad, so you don't have enough time to think about why the last scene was bad, while being dazzled by the jangling keys of the next scene. Its only saving grace is avoiding the baizuo politics which insulted the fans in TLJ.\n\nI don't believe the audience score here, it's being manipulated. I'm sure my review will go straight to the trash bin.","displayName":"D B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T16:51:18.332Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T16:51:25.852Z","user":{"userId":"977038961","realm":"RT","displayName":"D B","accountLink":"/user/id/977038961"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved this movie!!!!
