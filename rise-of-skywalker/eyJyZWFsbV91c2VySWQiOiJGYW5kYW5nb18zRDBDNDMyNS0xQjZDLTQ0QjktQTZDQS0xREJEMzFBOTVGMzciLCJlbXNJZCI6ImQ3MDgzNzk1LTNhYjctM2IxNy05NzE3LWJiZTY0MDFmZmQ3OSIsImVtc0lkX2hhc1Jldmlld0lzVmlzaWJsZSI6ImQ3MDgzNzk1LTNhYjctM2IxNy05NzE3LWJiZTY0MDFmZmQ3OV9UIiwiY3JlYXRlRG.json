It was better than Episodes I,II, and Solo. But anything beyond that, it lacks in focus. It ties up loose ends. Reworks some stuff, and doesn't overdue it with needless comic timing. It was an okay film. Some people have it ranked high, and others low. But the time I spent on it, it was okay. I'm hoping this is the last Star Wars for a while. We've gotten them coming year, after year, and I'm completely over it. It was a good run. Now it's time to let it rest.","displayName":"Seth M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T19:56:19.343Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T19:56:23.062Z","user":{"userId":"978127955","realm":"RT","displayName":"Seth M","accountLink":"/user/id/978127955"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Ð¢alentless, devoid of logic and meaning picture, parasitizing in the name of the great franchise.","displayName":"OllyGreen ","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2469719553125824/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T19:55:06.205Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T19:55:13.291Z","user":{"userId":"978394696","realm":"RT","displayName":"OllyGreen ","accountLink":"/user/id/978394696"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Story came together well.","displayName":"Richard","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T19:54:32.778Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T19:54:32.778Z","user":{"userId":"2418E3BB-585A-447A-BBD2-20C435438FBD","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Richard","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"It was like a nice looking piece candy, but once you put it on your mouth you realize how bad it tastes.
