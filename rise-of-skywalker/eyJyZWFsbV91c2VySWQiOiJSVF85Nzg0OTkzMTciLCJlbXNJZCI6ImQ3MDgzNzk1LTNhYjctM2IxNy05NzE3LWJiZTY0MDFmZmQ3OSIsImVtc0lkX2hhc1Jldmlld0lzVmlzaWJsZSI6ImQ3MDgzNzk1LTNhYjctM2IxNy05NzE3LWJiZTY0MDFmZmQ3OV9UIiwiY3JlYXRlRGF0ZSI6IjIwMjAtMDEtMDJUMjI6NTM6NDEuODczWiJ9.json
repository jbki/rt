I was expecting it to be a total shit show and was pleasantly surprised that, in my opinion, it is not. Yes, it was a safe way to go and was heavy on the fan servicing elements but I still enjoyed watching the movie. Is it the most amazing thing I have ever seen, no. Is it the most innovating installment in the saga, no. But it is fun and entertaining and that is the reason I watch movies so... I have to give it positive marks.","displayName":"Patrick R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157895378275960/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2020-01-02T22:52:03.025Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T22:52:10.823Z","user":{"userId":"978499334","realm":"RT","displayName":"Patrick R","accountLink":"/user/id/978499334"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely incredible.
