I would not rate it that highly, but, all in all, it was a satisfying way to spend the afternoon with my family, especially the daughter who went to a movie theater for the first time for Episode IV.","displayName":"paul k","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T05:02:10.849Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T05:02:10.849Z","user":{"userId":"edb7d683-1f8a-4561-95a4-b15c397c1f7e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"paul k","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Not what I expected!
