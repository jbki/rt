Didn't overthink or over analyze, I simply enjoyed the ending of a story I have loved for 39 long years. I loved this movie. Captured the magical feeling I had as a child. Plus my daughter loved it too and watching her it felt like a whole new generation discovering the magic.

There were so many loose ends, managing to put it all together and being completely fresh would have been next to impossible. Instead, they paid respect to the trilogy, had a perfect storyline, and made an awesome movie.

I felt like the director spent the first half of the movie cleaning up mess The Last Jedi left behind.  Once we got past all of that the second half of the movie was fantastic.  If the whole movie was as good as the second half this would have been a five star effort.  Indeed I have more respect for JJ Abrams now watching him repair all the damage caused by the previous director.  He did a good job with what the hand he was dealt.","displayName":"Stacy R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:28:45.069Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:28:49.312Z","user":{"userId":"977801363","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stacy R","accountLink":"/user/id/977801363"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Derek Connolly, Colin Trevorrow, J.J.
