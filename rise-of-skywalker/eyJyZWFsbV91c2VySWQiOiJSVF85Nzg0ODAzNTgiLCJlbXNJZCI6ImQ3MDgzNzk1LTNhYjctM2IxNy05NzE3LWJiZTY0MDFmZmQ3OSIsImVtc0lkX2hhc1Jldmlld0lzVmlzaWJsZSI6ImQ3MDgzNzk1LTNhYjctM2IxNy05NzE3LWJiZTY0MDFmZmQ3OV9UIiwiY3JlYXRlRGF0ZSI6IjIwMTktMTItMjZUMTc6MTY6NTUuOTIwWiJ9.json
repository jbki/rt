It felt rushed and a bit cheesy to me. Maybe it was the script - what the characters were saying most of the time felt contrived and not real. There were some good moments no doubt. Adam Driver delivered the best performance.

Been a lifelong fan ever since.  However, these final three episodes have been more like history repeating, but with a new cast you can’t seem to love as much as the original. Admittedly, this final episode is better than its two predecessors. Overall entertaining movie, but obviously difficult to wrap up in an epic and satisfying way.","displayName":"Ali V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:13:39.928Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:13:39.928Z","user":{"userId":"0E6F2F27-623E-4C48-9137-E141AB496802","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ali V","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good times.
