The first half is very fast paced with all characters hitting the ground running.  Once the movie slows down to focus on story and character development it improves.  There's a lot for the fans here, some would argue too much is crammed into one movie (I agree with this camp).  Looking back, the trilogy would have been better served by one director all the way through.  JJ Abrams did what he could to salvage this movie, but there are some obvious choices made in story, pacing and character dialogue (or lack of) that suffer on the final editing floor. Still, the visuals and score are stunning and make up for some of the movie's core flaws.","displayName":"Melina G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10155877437284654/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:27:30.805Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:27:39.854Z","user":{"userId":"976955950","realm":"RT","displayName":"Melina G","accountLink":"/user/id/976955950"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"}]}
