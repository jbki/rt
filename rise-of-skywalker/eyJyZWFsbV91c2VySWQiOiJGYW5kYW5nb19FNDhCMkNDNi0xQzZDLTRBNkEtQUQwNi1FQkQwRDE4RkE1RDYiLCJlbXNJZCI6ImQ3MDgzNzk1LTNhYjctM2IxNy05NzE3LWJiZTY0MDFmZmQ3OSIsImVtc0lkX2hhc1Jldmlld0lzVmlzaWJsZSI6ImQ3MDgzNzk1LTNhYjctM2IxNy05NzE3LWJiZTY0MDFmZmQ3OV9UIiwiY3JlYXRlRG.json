It felt like a throwback to the first series of movies.  The throwback feel made me nostalgic, and it felt good.  Overall the movie was well done and did an excellent job of recovering from the last film.  The end of the saga was well played and satisfying.","displayName":"Beth M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/672490996151190/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:50:00.668Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:50:09.641Z","user":{"userId":"976980553","realm":"RT","displayName":"Beth M","accountLink":"/user/id/976980553"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Critics get it wrong once again! This movie wipes the spit off the face of the fans who were sorely disappointed by The Last Jedi. The movie isn't perfect, it is a bit rushed and has some plot holes, but it is a fitting ending to this trilogy. Many questions answered, many awful parts of TLJ rendered inert. I loved it, will definitely pay to see again.","displayName":"Manny G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10210113159765556/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:49:59.148Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:49:59.148Z","user":{"userId":"977046647","realm":"RT","displayName":"Manny G","accountLink":"/user/id/977046647"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I think this was the best of the Disney trilogy...  But that is not saying much.  To be better than terrible is to still be bad.  The movie (like its first two installments) just doesn't feel authentic.  It doesn't feel like Star Wars.  We know that Disney can do it right, as both Rogue One and Mandalorian feel like Star Wars...  But this is another pass for me.","displayName":"Jay F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:49:46.403Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:49:55.804Z","user":{"userId":"913848385","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jay F","accountLink":"/user/id/913848385"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Must see!

An escape from reality. It doesn't preach to us or force a political agenda down our throats. It takes us on a wild ride of incredible CGI, great fight scenes, theatrics, humor, a little romance and a bit of sadness. I thoroughly enjoyed it.","displayName":"Chris B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000162754656/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:48:45.763Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:48:50.490Z","user":{"userId":"978471222","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris B","accountLink":"/user/id/978471222"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"}]}
