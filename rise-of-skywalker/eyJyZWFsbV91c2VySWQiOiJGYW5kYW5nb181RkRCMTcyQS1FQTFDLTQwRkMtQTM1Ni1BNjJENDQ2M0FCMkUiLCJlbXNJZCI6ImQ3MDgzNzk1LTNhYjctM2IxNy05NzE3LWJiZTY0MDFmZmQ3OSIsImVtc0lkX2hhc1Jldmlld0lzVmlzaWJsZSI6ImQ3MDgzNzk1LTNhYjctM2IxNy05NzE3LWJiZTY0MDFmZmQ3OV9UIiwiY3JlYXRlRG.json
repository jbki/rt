If you are fan, ignore the critics, this was the best of the final trilogy, was closer to Star Wars legends than the other two movies, and the movies that we all hoped we would get for the final trilogy. Also my 11 year old son thought this was the best Star Wars movie, not saying I agree, but just saying the kids will love it. Though it might be a little scary for much younger viewers.","displayName":"Thomas M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10221618168789472/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T19:40:26.358Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T19:40:32.231Z","user":{"userId":"978480743","realm":"RT","displayName":"Thomas M","accountLink":"/user/id/978480743"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"as an Star Wars fan I loved it!","displayName":"Carlos B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002876030587/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T19:39:11.551Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T19:39:16.284Z","user":{"userId":"914583812","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carlos B","accountLink":"/user/id/914583812"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Loved it!
