It not only completes the saga as a whole, but also completes the journey of the new characters within the trilogy. Rey and Kylo Ren are the standouts, and their performances are amazing. Yes their are parts in the movie you have to fill in yourself from the previous ones, but I found it easy to do. Overall the experience was amazing and Star Wars will live on FOREVER.
