There are definitely some beats that I can quibble with, but on the whole, I think this will please most fans of the series.

As a whole, Star Wars which stormed to life in 1977 and captured the imagination of countless people has fallen flat since and including Return of the Jedi.  Stupid cute characters, pointless repeated storylines and a dismal Episode 1,2, and 3.  This is NOT a good movie.  No real story Arc.  Maybe someday someone can reboot the entire thing and tell a story that makes sense and inspires.  This just disappoints.   Wait for the Netflix release.","displayName":"Mark D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1448176954/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T19:59:05.386Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T19:59:13.494Z","user":{"userId":"847459630","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark D","accountLink":"/user/id/847459630"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Мне понравилось завершение саги.
