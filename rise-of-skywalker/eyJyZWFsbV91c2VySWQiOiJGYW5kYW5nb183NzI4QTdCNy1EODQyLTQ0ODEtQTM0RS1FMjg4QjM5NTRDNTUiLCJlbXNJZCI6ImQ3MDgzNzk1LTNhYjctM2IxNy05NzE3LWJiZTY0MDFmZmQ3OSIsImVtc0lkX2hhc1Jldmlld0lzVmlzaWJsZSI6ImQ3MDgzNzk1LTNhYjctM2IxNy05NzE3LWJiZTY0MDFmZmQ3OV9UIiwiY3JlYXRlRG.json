I have lost faith in Disney's ability to make full length movies and Star Wars in general. Disney really should have just adapted the insane amount of books, comics, & video game stories instead of making all of that not canon. This movie is proof Disney has lost touch entirely. This was such a disappointment I will not support any Disney movies in theaters going forward. I will wait for a bootleg.","displayName":"ZZealleauss A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157601489450620/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:48:32.913Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:48:38.631Z","user":{"userId":"978471000","realm":"RT","displayName":"ZZealleauss A","accountLink":"/user/id/978471000"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"After the disaster known as the last Jedi, I went into this movie ready to hate it and I was ready to disown Star Wars forever, but as soon as the movie ended I realized I really enjoyed this movie! It’s not perfect but it’s an awesome conclusion to the story the force awakens started and also to the other 6 movies. This movie has a lot going on but personally I do not blame that on JJ Abrams, I blame it on Rian Johnson. This movie bummed me out, because it made me realize how this could have been an amazing trilogy if JJ had control of all 3 movies. Like I said, this movie isn’t perfect, but it’s still really good!","displayName":"Christian","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:48:26.493Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:48:26.493Z","user":{"userId":"EF8F7F5E-2C97-46A8-B720-53A017962625","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Christian","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I've been a Star Wars Fan since the first episode came out and have all of the Star Wars Movies on Blu-Ray.  I'll buy this one as well.  I especially liked how the characters were tied together at the end.
