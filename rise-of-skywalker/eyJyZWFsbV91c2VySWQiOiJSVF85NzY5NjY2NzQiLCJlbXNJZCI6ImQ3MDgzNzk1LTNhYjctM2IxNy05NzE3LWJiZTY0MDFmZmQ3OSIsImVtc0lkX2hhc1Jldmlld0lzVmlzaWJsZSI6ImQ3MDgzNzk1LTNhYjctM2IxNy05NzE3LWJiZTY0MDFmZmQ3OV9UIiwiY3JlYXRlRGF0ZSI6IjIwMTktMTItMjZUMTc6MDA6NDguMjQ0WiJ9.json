They retconned so many plot points and character arcs from TFA and TLJ that made some of the most interesting and original characters and storylines I've ever seen, only to destroy it all in TROS from the ridiculous choices they made.  I've been so invested in these stories for so long and within just one film Disney and lucasfilm have ruined it all. The film was called The Rise of Skywalker and in the end they killed off the last living Skywalker and made a Palpatine descendant assume the name and the legacy. In this sense, palpatine won. So what was the point of this new trilogy? I'm so confused and angry about it. Ben Solo should have lived! There was no reason or need for him to die. It was a shocking choice and a disgusting disrespect to George Lucas's original characters and it's ruined this trilogy for me for who knows how long.","displayName":"Kate B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10156861194663096/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:59:52.991Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:59:59.430Z","user":{"userId":"978480302","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kate B","accountLink":"/user/id/978480302"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was a great ending to the series...
