Yeah there are some parts the feel rushed and some underdeveloped characters (Knights of Ren), but thankfully they ignore most of TLJ. I think had Abrams directed all three of the films they could have been pretty solid as he could have used the middle film to flesh out more of his vision. \n\nSo, I liked it.
