It's a mess pace-wise, but I like where they're going with in terms of the story and the characters. Also, a lot of shots fired towards TLJ, which I certainly enjoyed. I wish JJ. Abrams had directed the whole trilogy, and I wish Disney had an actual plan for these movies. This movie tries and to some extent succeeds to deliver a satisfying end to the old & new characters. Definitely not perfect, but it was fun.","displayName":"Marcin S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T21:45:45.211Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T22:31:30.677Z","user":{"userId":"901122323","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marcin S","accountLink":"/user/id/901122323"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A bit slower moving than other Star Wars.","displayName":"Lorraine","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T21:45:43.634Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T21:45:43.634Z","user":{"userId":"b9c9792d-4b81-4d09-bff7-ec231f75e1e6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Lorraine","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Totally makes up for Episode VIII and is a great resolution to the saga!","displayName":"James M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T21:44:46.605Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T21:44:46.605Z","user":{"userId":"41080FA6-7CFA-425B-9C6B-6EB97A9B638F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"James M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it.

A bit overdone on revisiting the droid humor from days gone by.\nThe Leia scenes are understandably shallow, the continual references to old and well loved but now either dead or quite ancient characters is a bit tiring.\nA recommended movie if you're a Star Wars fan, as it puts a nice (yet clearly removable) cap on the whole series.","displayName":"RodR","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T21:44:03.967Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T21:44:03.967Z","user":{"userId":"B6E24DDF-3189-4B66-84DD-C54AA6C4FE11","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"RodR","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best of the new trilogy movies!","displayName":"David F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T21:43:55.172Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T21:43:55.172Z","user":{"userId":"AB55F0B2-6969-4F0B-B6E1-D3943D7B3CC4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"David F","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!
