Like every Star Wars Movie after Empire, it has its cringy and campy moments. But the story moves fast, the special effects are great. There aren’t any stupid and pointless subplots like in TLJ, and only a couple mind bending strategic decisions, which for Star Wars is acceptable. It’s worth the trip to see it on the big screen.
