It’s easily better than the prequels and Episode 8. There’s one questionable scene for me, but as I writer, I think it was left in the script to make a moment that followed it that much more heartbreaking, so I’m good with it. Ignore the critics saying “it’s the worst Star Wars ever.” They’re ridiculous. It won’t make every fan happy (whatever does), but it’s a solid and enjoyable final chapter.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T18:04:11.039Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T18:04:57.813Z","user":{"userId":"908621555","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/908621555"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"An unbalanced, Frankenstein of a film that spit in the face of The Last Jedi.","displayName":"Andrew K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T18:04:07.665Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T18:04:07.665Z","user":{"userId":"3D464653-CC1F-432C-9459-0C803A330E9E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Andrew K","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Boring,unoriginal,predictible,Rey....OMG Rey is soooo OVERPOWER she literally can do EVERYTHING without any training what so ever.This Movie is mind numbing and it's feels like you play an EASY mode in already easy video game.Totally trash.","displayName":"Hisyamuddin Z","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3584279658263786/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T18:03:51.886Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T18:04:03.326Z","user":{"userId":"978451694","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hisyamuddin Z","accountLink":"/user/id/978451694"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"They basically retold the same stories from the original trilogy and even the prequels plus through in stuff that was never mentioned in the first 2 or even hinted in the first 2.","displayName":"Roye","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T18:03:41.039Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T18:03:41.039Z","user":{"userId":"EEF0FF13-F81A-4AFB-9D89-FF20BC8B6D8F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Roye","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The movie leaves intact the lessons of The Last Jedi while still evolving them and rhyming with Return of the Jedi in its own unique ways.","displayName":"Danny B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T18:03:36.173Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T18:03:39.160Z","user":{"userId":"977330332","realm":"RT","displayName":"Danny B","accountLink":"/user/id/977330332"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I was not disappointed.  I loved the film, and the big, emotional moments, small callbacks, and even the so-called fan service.  I'm a life-long fan, born in 1970, and I had so much fun watching this.  It is not a perfect movie by any means, but that is not my expectation.  I want to have fun, be wowed, maybe cry a little, feel nostalgic, meet new droids and aliens, and leave feeling exhilarated.  Plus, Adam Driver.  <3","displayName":"Maryanne20 ","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T18:03:32.326Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T18:03:32.326Z","user":{"userId":"976680757","realm":"RT","displayName":"Maryanne20 ","accountLink":"/user/id/976680757"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"After the Last Jedi, this movie tries to fix the inconsistencies. While there are some good moments, and the actors do their jobs pretty well, it is still a bad Star Wars Trilogy movie. As a stand-alone would have been ok maybe 3 stars, but this trilogy was ruined in The Last Jedi.
