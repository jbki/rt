In my opinion, it helps to go back and watch Return of the Jedi, The Force Awakens, and The Last Jedi before watching The Rise of Skywalker. There's so many twists and turns linked to these 3 previous movies. In doing so, I feel people will have a better understanding while watching this film. This was an amazing end to the Skywalker saga!","displayName":"Derrick C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100004847860206/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:20:22.621Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:20:31.771Z","user":{"userId":"978452860","realm":"RT","displayName":"Derrick C","accountLink":"/user/id/978452860"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Going into this movie on Thursday night (December 19, 2019) I was nervous, scared and anxious. Star Wars was such a huge part of my life as a kid and i didn't want this movie to fail, i wanted it to conclude this 42 year, 9 movie saga in a satisfying way. After looking at the 56% on Rotten Tomatoes i lost hope, but after clearing my mind of others opinions i went in and for the next 2 and a half hours I watched one of the most entertaining movies of my life.\n\nStar Wars The Rise of Skywalker blew my expectations out of the water, i wasn't expecting much, but i found my self never bored. This movie is quick and gets to the point. Never spending more than 4 minutes on one subject it moves fast and never stops and never bores. From start to finish it made me feel like a kid again, watching star wars for the first time. I felt so many emotions in this movie. Nostalgia, Love, Sadness, Joy. I cheered, oh i cheered quite a lot. I cried because i watched my childhood unfold as it comes to a close, the nostalgia hit me so hard in this movie. Some might call it fan service but it was everything i wanted.\n\nThis movie is what is considered a mixed bag, as i left the theatre i overheard people praising it and people trashing it. Not everyone is going to love this movie, not everyone is going to hate this movie. This movie isn't perfect in any way, it's not the best star wars movie, but it is a good ending to a wonderful saga of films. Star Wars is something i will always keep with me, i grew up binging these movies and i will continue to. \n\nThis movie will blow you away, the choices made in this movie may piss you off but i liked mostly every decision made in this movie. Just don't ruin for others by saying what most Rotten Tomatoes critics have been saying \"it's the worst movie i've ever seen\" oh shut up, just because it doesn't fulfill your every want doesn't mean it sucks. I'm sorry to the fanboys who can't like this movie because it's not as food as the originals were. Just sit down, enjoy the film and don't diss on others for their opinions. For those who haven't seen it you're in for one hell of a ride, this movie means so much to so many generations of people. Not everyone will like it but i certainly liked it. It's a satisfying end to the Skywalker Saga as we know it. \n\n9.2/10","displayName":"Isaac Q","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:20:18.488Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:20:23.049Z","user":{"userId":"977792497","realm":"RT","displayName":"Isaac Q","accountLink":"/user/id/977792497"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The positives out way the negatives 10 to 1.
