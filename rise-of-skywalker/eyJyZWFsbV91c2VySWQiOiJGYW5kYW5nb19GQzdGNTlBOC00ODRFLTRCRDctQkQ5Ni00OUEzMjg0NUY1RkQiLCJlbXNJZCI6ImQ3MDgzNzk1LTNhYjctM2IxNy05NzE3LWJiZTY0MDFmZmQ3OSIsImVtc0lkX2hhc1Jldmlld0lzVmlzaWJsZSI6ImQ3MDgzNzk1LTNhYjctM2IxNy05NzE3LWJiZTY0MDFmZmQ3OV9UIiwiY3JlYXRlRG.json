The Rain Johnson movi has his flaws, but seeing movie another times you see some new concepts and expand Star Wars Universe, but in the rise of Skywalker you a fast sequence with no consequences meaningful to story. Some times JJ Abrams mock with the audience by telling the next actions using Palpatine voice. \n\nIn reality we'll missing George Lucas direction with Jar Jar Binks, which was very innovative to the cinema even the collective dislike from fans. \n\nI expected after that movie Dave Filone produce more Star Wars content and maybe a decent Skylwaker saga when celebrate all universe and not discriminate some good parts only his don't agree with, like JJ Abrams do.","displayName":"Filipe M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10211821238436116/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T05:55:05.876Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T05:55:17.969Z","user":{"userId":"975877274","realm":"RT","displayName":"Filipe M","accountLink":"/user/id/975877274"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"23h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Best in the new trilogy","displayName":"Casey","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T05:53:28.862Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T05:53:28.862Z","user":{"userId":"6ECA64FC-BC39-408D-AEC2-1E83B92C6BF7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Casey","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"23h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Nothing new here.
