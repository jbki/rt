There is finally an attempt at some character development in this trilogy but the lack of cohesive plot and the frenetic pace that the audience is put through gives little time for any of this to happen. There is little creativity including the rehashed Williams musical score  throughout the film. Disney has truly killed this once-proud franchise. So disappointing.","displayName":"John A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/631183036/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T17:55:02.448Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T17:55:10.812Z","user":{"userId":"935456769","realm":"RT","displayName":"John A","accountLink":"/user/id/935456769"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"11h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"as a stand alone film or the first film in a trilogy it could be a 3/5, as the last of a trilogy it is a 2/5, and as the ending to a saga of 9 films it gets a 1/5. no structure, over arching message or consequences. its mostly fan service and member-berries. still better than SW:TLJ, how is Rian Johnson still getting work. also JJ sucks at writing endings. beautiful in 3D, still will not be getting this on 4K.
