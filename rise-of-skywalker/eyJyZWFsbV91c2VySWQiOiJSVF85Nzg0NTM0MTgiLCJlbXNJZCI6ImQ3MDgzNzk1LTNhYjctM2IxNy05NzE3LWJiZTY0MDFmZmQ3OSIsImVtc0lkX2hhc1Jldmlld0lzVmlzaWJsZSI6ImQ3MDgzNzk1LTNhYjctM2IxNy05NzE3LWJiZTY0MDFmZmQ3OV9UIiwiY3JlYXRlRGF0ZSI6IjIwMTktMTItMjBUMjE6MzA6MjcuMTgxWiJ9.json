Rian Johnson and Abrams had no agreement or plan for this trilogy's story, whith this movie being living proof of it. JJ's main goal with this movie was just to retcon the horrible film that came before. The few genuinely good moments are far too spread, and ironically have nothing to do with the Skywalker family or the contrived \"main plot\" about the Force. Adam Driver is reduced to an errand boy with very little agency excluding one single moment near the end of the film. There's no creativity or soul. The best part about seeing this film, is that now that I know how this mess of a trilogy ended, I no longer have to ever watch these three films ever again. Go watch the film with family and friends. You may get a couple laughs at how silly some moments in the film are.","displayName":"Azalea R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:30:14.594Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:30:22.266Z","user":{"userId":"977201429","realm":"RT","displayName":"Azalea R","accountLink":"/user/id/977201429"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"This movie was a terrible waste of time and potential.  It could have been so epic, but instead we're once again treated to paper-thin characters, awful dialogue and overblown special effects.  I hope that someday Star Wars will return to it's past glory, but Rise of Skywalker is not the movie to do it.  I'm almost out of patience with the Star Wars franchise.","displayName":"Luke J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:30:07.148Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:30:09.942Z","user":{"userId":"976976870","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luke J","accountLink":"/user/id/976976870"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Critics hate it because of the fan service and the jumbled mess that is the first 40 minutes. But if you can watch this movie and not get hit with the feels you are crazy. I felt truly satisfied throughout. Sure there were some parts that were a little out there. As a film itself, I would probably agree with critics. But as the final star wars film in the Skywalker saga? It's absolutely awesome!","displayName":"Jimmy H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/731778522/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:30:06.692Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T06:32:53.717Z","user":{"userId":"787726374","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jimmy H","accountLink":"/user/id/787726374"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Beyond a subpar ending","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:29:59.576Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:29:59.576Z","user":{"userId":"970725079","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/970725079"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Really good film, best in the sequel trilogy and top three in the saga.
