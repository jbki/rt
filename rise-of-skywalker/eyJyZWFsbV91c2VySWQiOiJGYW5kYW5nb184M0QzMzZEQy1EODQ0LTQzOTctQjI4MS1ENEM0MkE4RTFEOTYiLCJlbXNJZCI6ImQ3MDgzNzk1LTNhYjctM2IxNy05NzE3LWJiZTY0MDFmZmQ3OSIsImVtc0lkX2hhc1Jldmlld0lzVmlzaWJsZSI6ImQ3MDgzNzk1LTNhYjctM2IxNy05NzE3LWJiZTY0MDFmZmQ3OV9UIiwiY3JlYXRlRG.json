The people who didn't like it I mean like what more did you want. This movie was never supposed to satisfy everyone but it is an amazing movie. I hated the first two because it didn't feel like anything that happened had any meaning but after this movie it actually solves a lot of the questions that needed to be justified in order to make sense and it does it beautifully. Kylo ren is the best. This brought back my love for what Star Wars stands for.","displayName":"David C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1291157727742102/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T02:17:34.525Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T02:17:38.733Z","user":{"userId":"978495341","realm":"RT","displayName":"David C","accountLink":"/user/id/978495341"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Definitely made for fans...obviously critics don't understand that.","displayName":"Braxton S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T02:15:36.299Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T02:15:36.299Z","user":{"userId":"978495339","realm":"RT","displayName":"Braxton S","accountLink":"/user/id/978495339"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"LOVEDDDDD THE MOVIEEEE","displayName":"Alyssa I","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T02:15:24.309Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T02:15:24.309Z","user":{"userId":"fae9d8b5-a920-40ef-adcb-14b12aa64757","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Alyssa I","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"}]}
