The cuts between scenes were disjointed and and the camera shots were too quick, leading to a lack of depth and quality dialogue. It felt like the crew thought viewers have short attention spans and can't focus on the same shot for more than 2 seconds. \n\nAfter about an hour of heavy exposition, the movie being to pick up. While the middle of the movie was far from perfect, there were some truly perfect scenes that elevated the rest of the movie. For instance, the dynamic between Finn and Poe was charming and hilarious, giving viewers some much needed breaks between the vast majority of dark and tense scenes in this movie. There are also some long awaited conversations that happen that feel so satisfying to watch. \n\nI didn't like the main plot which felt dull, consisting of finding a person, who leads them to an object, which leads them to another person, who leads them to someone else, etc...But, I did enjoy the subplot between Kylo Ren and Rey. Adam and Daisy always give a phenomenal performance that captures the viewer's attention. The scenes between them were objectively the best in the movie and deserved more narrative attention. \n\nWhat bothers me most about movie was what a let down the ending is. I actually enjoyed the middle of the movie and was feeling good about where the story was going. But what happened at the end caught me off guard and was needlessly depressing. It conflicted with the hopeful title of the movie and was tonally all wrong. It pains me to say, but the last scene in the movie felt like a middle finger to the whole Skywalker saga. I left wondering, what was even the point of the last 42 years of Star Wars movies?","displayName":"Savannah N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000281120364/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:31:49.363Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:31:57.907Z","user":{"userId":"911137414","realm":"RT","displayName":"Savannah N","accountLink":"/user/id/911137414"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was so much better than I expected.
