Should have been named: Rise of the Legend Of Skywalker.\nThis movie was an amalgam of Empire Strikes Back anf Return of the Jedi.  And for both these reasons, I blame J.J. Abrams for being lazy and telling the same story with different characters.\nAnd since Disney owns both Star Wars and Marvel, they didnt think anyone would notice copying the final fight scene in Endgame but use Rey and Palpatine.  Pathetically lazy.","displayName":"J D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T09:55:25.282Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T09:55:25.282Z","user":{"userId":"B618D4DE-43F7-480B-8C4A-C0C1F3CAD35A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"J D","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The story was easy enough to follow. even if you didn't see all the story.

I especially liked Kylo turning to the light after being killed by Rey and then forced-healed back to life. He had to die to become Ben again. That was nice. Leia being trained by Luke was epic!
