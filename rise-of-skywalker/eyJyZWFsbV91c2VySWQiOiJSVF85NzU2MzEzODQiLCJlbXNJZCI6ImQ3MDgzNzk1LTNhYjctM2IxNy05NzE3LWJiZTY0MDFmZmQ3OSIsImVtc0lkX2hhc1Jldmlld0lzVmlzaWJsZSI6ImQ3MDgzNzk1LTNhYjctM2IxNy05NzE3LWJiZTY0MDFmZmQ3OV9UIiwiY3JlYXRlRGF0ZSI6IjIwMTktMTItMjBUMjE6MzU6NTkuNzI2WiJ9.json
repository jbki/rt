Instead of offering actual reviews they just attempt to be as negative as possible so their posts are sensational and eye catching for views and advert money.

The pace is quick (basically the opposite speed of TLJ) and is exciting from the get go. So much is packed into this film, makes me realize I need a second viewing. Obvious parallels to the original trilogy and a good way to end it all. I would have given this 5 stars if I got the ending I wanted.
