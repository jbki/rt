Rise of Skywalker is absolutely perfect in that it takes everything from VII and VIII and makes it all make sense and gives a brilliant ending to the trilogy.

They judge movies way to much with political or ideological issues in mind. They also have too much influence on something like rotten tomatoes......my advice to others is look what the audience score was not the critics score was.","displayName":"Carson D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:40:12.091Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:40:25.566Z","user":{"userId":"977906093","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carson D","accountLink":"/user/id/977906093"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Favorite movie of the current series.
