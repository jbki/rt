This trilogy had no vision, direction, or road map, and it shows. I would have rather watched the movie that they will \"inevitably\" make  about the making of these 3 movies just to  get some sort of \"justification\" for this mess of movie. Acting was good from all parties involved, score was nice, fight sequences are OK, but all of those element couldn't save this movie from bad story writing .","displayName":"Yusur A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T14:48:20.568Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T14:48:20.568Z","user":{"userId":"978498412","realm":"RT","displayName":"Yusur A","accountLink":"/user/id/978498412"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie!
