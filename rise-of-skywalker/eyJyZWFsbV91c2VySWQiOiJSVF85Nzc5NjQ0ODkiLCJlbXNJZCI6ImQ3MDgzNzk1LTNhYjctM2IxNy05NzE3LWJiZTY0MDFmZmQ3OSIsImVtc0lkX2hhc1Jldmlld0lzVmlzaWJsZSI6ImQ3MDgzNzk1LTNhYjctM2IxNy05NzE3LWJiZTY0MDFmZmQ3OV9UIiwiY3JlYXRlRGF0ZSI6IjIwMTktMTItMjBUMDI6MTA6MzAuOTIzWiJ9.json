It was certainly better then The Last Jedi but most of this movies problems all stem from TLJ wasting an entire movie where we should have had more character development. This is by far the worst trilogy of the three. To be honest it doesn't feel like an ending at all.","displayName":"Daniel K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T02:05:42.012Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T17:10:09.891Z","user":{"userId":"977284405","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel K","accountLink":"/user/id/977284405"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"It’s OK.

The movie made no sense and destroyed the legacy of the Skywalkers.  I understand JJ Abrams and Disney had their hands tied by what Rian Johnson did with TLJ but that  the horrible decisions made with this movie breaks all logic and commonsense. Save yourself the money and wait for this to hit DisneyPlus.
