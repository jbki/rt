The entire series is a hot mess and we love it for it. This movie has that Star Wars magic that connects generations of fans. Fans will be delighted to find many Easter Eggs and call backs to the old trilogys, TV shows, and comics. I loved this movie and it was a fantastic end to this sequel trilogy.","displayName":"albert g","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T00:38:23.294Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T00:38:26.303Z","user":{"userId":"978454652","realm":"RT","displayName":"albert g","accountLink":"/user/id/978454652"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"The film to me felt like a weak conclusion to a series that has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.
