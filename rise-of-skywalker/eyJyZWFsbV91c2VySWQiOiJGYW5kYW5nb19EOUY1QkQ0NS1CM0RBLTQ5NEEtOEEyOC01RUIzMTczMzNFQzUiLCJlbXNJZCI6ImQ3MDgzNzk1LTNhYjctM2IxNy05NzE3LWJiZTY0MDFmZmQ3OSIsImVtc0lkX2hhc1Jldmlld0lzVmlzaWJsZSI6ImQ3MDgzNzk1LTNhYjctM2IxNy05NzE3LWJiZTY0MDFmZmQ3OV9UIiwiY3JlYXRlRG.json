I was impressed greatly so with the scale and mass of the environments as well as the dilemmas. The only thing I found distasteful was that marketing kinda spoiled a few things in the advertisements. Unless your an avid Star wars and movie fan in general it probably went unnoticed. I do have to say it brought back memories of the old star wars franchise unlike the previous ones to this new saga of star wars. Overall it was quite impressive.","displayName":"Seth D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T06:56:43.613Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T06:56:43.613Z","user":{"userId":"DF495376-311B-464E-9AE2-E65F9A5D5F1F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Seth D","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Last one!!!
