Disney's Sequel Trilogy should have been planned out better from the start, but this felt like the best possible way to save it. I commend Abrams effort and look forward to the creativity freedom that Star Wars will now possess outside of the Skywalker saga.","displayName":"Lazaras P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1410574738980398/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T04:20:24.783Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:27:51.744Z","user":{"userId":"976615895","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lazaras P","accountLink":"/user/id/976615895"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This movie was everything I hoped it would be! After The Last Jedi (a movie I kind of liked but I felt had some serious issues), it was nice to see Star Wars return to form and provide a fitting end to both the Sequel Trilogy and the saga overall! It was an emotional rollercoaster for sure, and I will definitely be going to see it again at LEAST 2 more times.\n\nIf you are a FAN of Star Wars you will appreciate this film. If you are a casual fan or a critic looking to have your \"expectations subverted\" a la The Last Jedi, this may not be the film for you.\n\nCinematography was amazing, the score was incredible as always, and this was by far the best acting in the sequel trilogy. Docking it a half star for one small issue I had but other than that this movie is awesome!","displayName":"Alfred S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1530504153685152/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T04:17:20.345Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:50:55.818Z","user":{"userId":"976963405","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alfred S","accountLink":"/user/id/976963405"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"great movie...some plot points could have been explained better but overall good.","displayName":"Elsie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T04:11:24.059Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T04:36:05.531Z","user":{"userId":"0ED2D91E-9FFE-45BC-96B6-4704D1110293","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Elsie","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"2nd time seeing it and it only seemed to get better.
