Overall the plot was predictable. The pace left no place for moments that mattered. It was action-packed but to the point of just becoming boring.

It was a beautiful conclusion for the new trilogy, braking old paradigms and establishing new boundaries for the force. I think this movie established great character development for the main characters, especially Rey and Ben. C-3PO comedy is pure gold, on point to break the more sinister tones a little. I just enjoyed the hell out of this movie, it was super fun for me.

I'm not sure just how deep I can go without spoiling the movie horribly, but I ultimately liked the resolution. I left the theater excited and wishing to see more with Rey, so that was a good sign.
