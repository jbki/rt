For a franchise that's existed for over 40 years to be so tone-deaf to a majority of it's fans (and not the crybabies who didn't like The Last Jedi) is unbelievable. No spoilers here, but my summary in a nutshell (which I acknowledge is as worthless as the next person's):\nIt didn't excite me or move me. It didn't intrigue me or challenge me. It didn't make me feel anything. The other reviews are spot-on in that it's too rushed. TROS doesn't spend time on character development because it assumes you're already all-in and just want to see flashy battles and hurry up to the ending.\nSay what you want about The Last Jedi, but at least it was daring. The Rise of Skywalker was conventional, ho-hum, tent-pole IP moviemaking which plays to the lowest common denominator. I guess that's what happens when Disney gets involved.\nYet somehow Disney allowed Endgame to flourish, and they figured out how to put some emotional heft and consequences in their capstone. Endgame certainly wasn't perfect either, but they figured out in 10 years how to wrap things up better than Lucasfilm could in 42. \nThe Rise of Skywalker is not the worst movie in the franchise (Phantom Menace will always have that honor). It IS the most disappointing though.","displayName":"Jeff W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:17:33.743Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:17:41.615Z","user":{"userId":"902377072","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeff W","accountLink":"/user/id/902377072"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I think this movie is very satisfying, both to people who loved TLJ and people who hated it.
