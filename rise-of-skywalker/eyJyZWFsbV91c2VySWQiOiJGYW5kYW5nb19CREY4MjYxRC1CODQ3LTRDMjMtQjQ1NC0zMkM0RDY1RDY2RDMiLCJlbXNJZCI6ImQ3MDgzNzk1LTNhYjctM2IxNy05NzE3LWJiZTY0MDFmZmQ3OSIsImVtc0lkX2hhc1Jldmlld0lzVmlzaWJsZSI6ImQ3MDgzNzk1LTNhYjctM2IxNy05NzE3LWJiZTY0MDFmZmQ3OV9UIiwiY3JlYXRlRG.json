One of my favourite Star Wars films. I was lucky enough to go in having not watched any trailers so it was completely new to me. Amazing direction, character development and story. The fast pace made it a rollercoaster of sci-fi greatness. I think a lot of critics that are giving it a bad name are wishing for it to be their \"perfect\" star wars film but of course that can never happen. We need hope to kill the hype. Go and see this film, enjoy seeing all you favourite characters and go with the ride. Forget the fandom menace. A great film for representation of women and people of colour. It's introducing a whole new demographic to the magic of star wars and that is excellent.","displayName":"Robert S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:51:46.820Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:51:50.077Z","user":{"userId":"978441560","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert S","accountLink":"/user/id/978441560"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It's a satisfying, fast-paced, fantasy adventure with humor and heart.
