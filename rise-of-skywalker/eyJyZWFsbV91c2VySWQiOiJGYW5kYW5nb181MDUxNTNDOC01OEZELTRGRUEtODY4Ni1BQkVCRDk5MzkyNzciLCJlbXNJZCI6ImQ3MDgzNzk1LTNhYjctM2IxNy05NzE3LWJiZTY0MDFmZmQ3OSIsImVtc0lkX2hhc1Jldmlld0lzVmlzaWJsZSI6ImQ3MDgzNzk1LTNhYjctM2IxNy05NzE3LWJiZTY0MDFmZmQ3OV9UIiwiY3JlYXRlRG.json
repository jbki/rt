Bad soundtrack\n3. Filled with plot holes and inconsistencies \n4. Premise of the movie that darth sidious returns not only feels unplanned but ruins every film before it\n5. Many rules grounded in the star wars universe are broken without explanation (primarily using the force the bring back the dead)\n6 movie feels rushed\n7. Movie makes it so obvious that there was no endgoal planned for this trilogy\n8. Even the action is boring and lightsbaer duels and space battles r dull\n9. Steals too many elements from original star wars trilogy similar to in tfa\n10. Too much ex machina moments\n11. Characters always make stupid descisions\n12.  Many times character r persumed dead or have some sort of conflict but they immediatyl come back or the conflict is resolved immediately thus ruining any tension.\n13. Characters use new overpowered force abilities that no one used before without any explanation of how they learned these abilities and y they havent been used before by other force users.\n14. Most characters have no character development and moments in movie feel unearned\n14. Did i mention plot holes cuz there r too many (theres a youtube vid by shadiversity that names a few)","displayName":"Yusuf","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:41:13.196Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:43:27.794Z","user":{"userId":"4e7298eb-4abc-4ecb-b1f1-8cf283af313a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Yusuf","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good story line\nToo much light saber fighting\nBetter than Return of the Jedi","displayName":"MIchael S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:40:50.918Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:40:50.918Z","user":{"userId":"4eabe62a-8f9e-4197-be22-08c0e5ade370","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"MIchael S","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"it had its stupid moments that didn't make sense but it was so entertaining and well made that you just were kind of able to ignore those parts","displayName":"Gianna R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1950583165047974/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:40:46.306Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:40:52.260Z","user":{"userId":"978005873","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gianna R","accountLink":"/user/id/978005873"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best of the new Trilogy!","displayName":"shawn","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:40:11.573Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T01:41:37.510Z","user":{"userId":"D81F38C3-39D3-42AD-BE8D-C29DB291C1A5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"shawn","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The exciting movie of the new trilogy!

To make a truly great movie you've got to have a solid story that doesnt worry about what someone is gonna like or dislike,  this definitely wasnt the case. overall the movie was entertaining but it does a discredit to the star wars saga and pays too much fan service trying to appease the masses...you can certainly tell it was a modern Disney production","displayName":"Adrian C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/720657281461465/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:39:39.021Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:39:48.546Z","user":{"userId":"976929722","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adrian C","accountLink":"/user/id/976929722"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"}]}
