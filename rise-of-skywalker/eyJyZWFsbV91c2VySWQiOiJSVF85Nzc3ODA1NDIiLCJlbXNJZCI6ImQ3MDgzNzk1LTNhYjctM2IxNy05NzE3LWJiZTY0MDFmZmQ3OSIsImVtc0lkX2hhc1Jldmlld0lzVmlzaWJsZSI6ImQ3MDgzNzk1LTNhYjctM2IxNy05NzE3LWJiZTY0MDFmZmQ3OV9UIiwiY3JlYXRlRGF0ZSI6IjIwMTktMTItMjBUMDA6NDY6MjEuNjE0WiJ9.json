(No Spoilers)\nRise of Skywalker midnight screening complete. This film only demonstrates the disorganisation of Disney as they attempt to backpedal after The Last Jedi. Not only is the film unoriginal, but I'd go so far as to call it bland fan fiction. The plot holes are so obvious it literally hurts to watch. Star Wars is about the Skywalker bloodline, and more importantly the prophecy of Anakin Skywalker bringing balance to the force. The conclusion of the \"Skywalker Saga\" solidifies itself as anything but the story of the Skywalkers, but rather the story of a girl who got everything and didn't have to work for it. Poor writing, poor character development, and a story completely laden with \"progressive politics\" undeniably indicates that the core plot of Star Wars has been crushed under Disney. I forecast potential layoffs at Disney/Lucasfilm over this 3rd failed outing (The Last Jedi and Solo being 1 and 2 respectively). If you don't watch Star Wars for the story, then enjoy. But if you're a fan who's read into the lore, then I'm sorry, you won't be pleased. I suggest you save your money and make a statement to Disney that you won't accept this level of quality.","displayName":"Alec W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/938461949830666/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:44:36.085Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:44:42.265Z","user":{"userId":"978204355","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alec W","accountLink":"/user/id/978204355"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Messy to say the least.
