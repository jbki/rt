It managed to close up some holes in the story and also explain why Rey was so powerful without much training.  \nLots of action in the movie as well and it didnt seem like it was 2 1/2 hours long which is a good sign.  I would rate it higher but Im not a huge fan of bringing characters back from the dead, etc.","displayName":"Bphawk64","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T19:06:02.570Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T19:06:02.570Z","user":{"userId":"7461c68f-8fc3-441f-b469-a0557aec80f7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bphawk64","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it.
