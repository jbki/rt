Dysfunctional Disney are stifling Star Wars because they don't understand ( or care maybe?)their new toy! 42 years of tension turned into missed opportunities by side lining fan favourites over an agenda for pushing new characters that fans feel coerced into liking at the expense of closure for those they were really invested in. Real fans never got the 3 hour + opus they deserved. Fans don't want to feel handled by executives who don't understand their passion or who make judgements based on arbitrary opinions of what's best for them. The Rise Of Skywalker reeks of executive over reach, direction by proxy, manipulation even. The result is a dystopian cinematic mess that taunts us with what might have been!","displayName":"Andrew M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2074516392565569/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T04:14:56.196Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T04:15:09.210Z","user":{"userId":"977138917","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew M","accountLink":"/user/id/977138917"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 03, 2020"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The storyline, acting, visuals and score were all incredible, also very moving","displayName":"Vinnie Van pelt","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T04:14:11.721Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T04:14:11.721Z","user":{"userId":"d4367416-dd82-48a8-9dd4-f077a591ef6b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Vinnie Van pelt","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great action!
