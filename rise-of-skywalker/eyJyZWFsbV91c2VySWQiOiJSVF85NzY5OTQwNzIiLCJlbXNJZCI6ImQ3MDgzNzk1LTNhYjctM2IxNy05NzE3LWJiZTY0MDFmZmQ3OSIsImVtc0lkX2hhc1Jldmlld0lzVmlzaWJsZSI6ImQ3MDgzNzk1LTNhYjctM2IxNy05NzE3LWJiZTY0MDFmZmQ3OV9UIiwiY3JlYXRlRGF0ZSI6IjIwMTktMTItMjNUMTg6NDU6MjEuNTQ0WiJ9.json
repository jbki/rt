Visually speaking it’s beautiful and the sound design is amazing but when the dust settles one wonders what the whole point of it all was even for... other than to make Disney more money,m. If they didn’t have an interesting story to tell from the onset why bother? I loved Force Awakens, even with its familiarities. I even appreciated The Last Jedi for making bold choices and saying something new (though the whole thread of the casino I could’ve did without). But this, it just revealed how much of a mess and how little they really cared for the original trilogy and how little they had to say. Would it have killed Disney not to rehash the End Game ending so close to it’s release? All things considered, very disappointing...","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:43:27.402Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:43:27.402Z","user":{"userId":"973871179","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/973871179"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Had lots of potential but zoomed pass good story through exposition.
