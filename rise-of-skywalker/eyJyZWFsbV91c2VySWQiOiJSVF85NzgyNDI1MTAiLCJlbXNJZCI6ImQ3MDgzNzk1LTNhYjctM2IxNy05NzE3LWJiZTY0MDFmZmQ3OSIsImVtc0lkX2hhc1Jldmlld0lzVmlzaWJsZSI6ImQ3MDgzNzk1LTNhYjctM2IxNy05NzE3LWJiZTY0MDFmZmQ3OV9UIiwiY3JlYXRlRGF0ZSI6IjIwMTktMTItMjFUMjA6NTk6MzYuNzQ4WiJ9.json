A bit rushed at times, but very epic. No thanks to RJ is what caused this rushed feel. It truly was Reys/ Bens story. I did wish there were certain aspects to have been incorporated, but that honestly would detract from what this trilogy was meant to be. The next generation. And the poetic Ironic Justice of the Siths defeat. Brilliant. If TLJ were to reveal one large point I think this film would have flowed better and would not have be required to be rushed. Its worth our respect.","displayName":"Brian C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:59:25.658Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:59:25.658Z","user":{"userId":"977832963","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian C","accountLink":"/user/id/977832963"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I have been a major Star Wars fan since'77.

I left the theater wanting to come back and watch it again. When I left the theater after watching The Last Jedi I was upset and it took me weeks to come to terms that that was it... that movie was canon and could not be undone. The Rise of Skywalker is a fun movie (not the best way to end the Skywalker Saga at all) given what JJ had to work with. Not nearly as bad as the “critics” claim it was.
