This installment left a lot to be desired. It seemed packed with scenes that were unexplained almost like cramming two movies into one. Leia's part was so hollow it seems she should have been left out. At the end you have a million questions that may never be answered. JJ Abrams made his own mark on Star Trek and now he has done it with Star Wars. Wish someone else would have directed it. I'm not even excited to watch it again.","displayName":"Troy B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:05:38.497Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:05:39.156Z","user":{"userId":"ffd573b8-2295-492f-965c-3d7fa2404e7b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Troy B","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Not the best but some really cool parts, just glad its over at this point","displayName":"James","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:05:29.796Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:05:29.796Z","user":{"userId":"43988835-0FBB-411B-9E8A-F671A2536D49","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"James","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"good movie and a satisfying end of a series I started as a child.","displayName":"Theodore B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:05:23.865Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:05:23.865Z","user":{"userId":"67250813-8DDC-4CE5-81FA-C9958C38FDA6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Theodore B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"good tidy conclusion","displayName":"cheflestrud","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:05:11.290Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:05:11.290Z","user":{"userId":"44251AD3-9423-4FB9-9807-4527C2C3E047","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"cheflestrud","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Wasn't the best of the saga.

The plot inconsistencies and unsatisfying ending make it a shameful money grab of a conclusion to a trilogy that probably didn't need to be made.
