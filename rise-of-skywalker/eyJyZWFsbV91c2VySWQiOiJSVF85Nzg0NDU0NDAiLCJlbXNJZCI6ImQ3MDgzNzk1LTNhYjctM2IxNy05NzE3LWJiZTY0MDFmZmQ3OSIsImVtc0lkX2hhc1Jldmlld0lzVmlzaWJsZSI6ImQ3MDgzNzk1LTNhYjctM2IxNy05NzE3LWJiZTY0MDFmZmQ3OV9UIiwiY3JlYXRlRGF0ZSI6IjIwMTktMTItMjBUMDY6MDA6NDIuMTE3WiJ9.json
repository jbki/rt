It ruined Star Wars, in fact, it straight up disrespected my childhood. I Expect a movie to sum things up, not a complete and utter confusing labyrinth of a movie. It was fast paced, made no time for character development, completely disregarded the general idea of midichlorians, and destroyed my view of any other Star Wars movie. I am so greatly disappointed and insulted by this movie that I may just never watch a Star Wars movie again.","displayName":"Mikey C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:00:39.284Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:00:39.284Z","user":{"userId":"978445379","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mikey C","accountLink":"/user/id/978445379"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"As a casual fan of the Star Wars movies I really enjoyed it.
