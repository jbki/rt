I love it.  There are some times when it seems like Rise of Skywalker is saying \"this is what TLJ was supposed to say\", but in most instances, it was a situation of Rian Johnson showing while JJ Abrams was telling.  If you are going to see the movie, you may want to bring a pad and paper as the plot gets a little involved as it tries to wrap up every loose end.  The first act moves at a pace that I imagine is the source of all those epilepsy warnings.  Fortunately, it settles down by Act 2.  Still, I imagine there will be a lot of fanboys complaining, \"but they didn't explain...\"  That's even with Maz Kanata being renamed Maz Exposition.  Most of the time I could live with it, except for [censored for spoilers].\n\nThere are a lot of homages (or ripoffs) to Return of the Jedi in this film, although many times i said to myself \"well, I'm glad they didn't do that or it would be too much on the nose.\"\n\nI realize I gave this film a 4 sttar review although mostly I've picked it apart so far.  Some of that is because of spoilers.  Mostly, though, it's because JJ has a talent for making films that are better than the sum of their parts.  (while on the topic of JJ-- STOP IT WITH THE LENS FLARES-- they're just so distracting in this film).  All in all, I think this film will go a long way to healing the divided fandom of Star Wars.  It doesn't try to retcon TLJ, but provides some further context that the \"haters\" will find acceptable.","displayName":"Darin S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/635840096/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T08:43:35.219Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:32:09.846Z","user":{"userId":"817563260","realm":"RT","displayName":"Darin S","accountLink":"/user/id/817563260"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I was somewhat disappointed. I thought the movie was disjointed and didn’t have a clearly defined story arc, but rather was an attempt to clean up some messes, whether they be perceived or real. The ultimate conclusion was somewhat satisfying, but how they got there left quite a bit to be desired. There were some humorous moments and some cool action scenes, but everything was all over the place so sometimes I had to think about why this scene was where it was. Overall I enjoyed it, but it was still somewhat disappointing.
