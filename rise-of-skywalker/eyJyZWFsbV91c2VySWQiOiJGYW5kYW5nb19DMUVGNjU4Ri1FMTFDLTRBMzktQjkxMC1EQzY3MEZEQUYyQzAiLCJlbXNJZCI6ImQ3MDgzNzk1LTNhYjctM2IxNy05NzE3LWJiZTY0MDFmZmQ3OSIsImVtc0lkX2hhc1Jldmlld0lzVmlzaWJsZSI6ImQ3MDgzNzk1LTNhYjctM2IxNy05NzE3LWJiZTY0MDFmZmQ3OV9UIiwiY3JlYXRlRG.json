I'm losing track. I rank this 6 of nine. This one is fun because you see so many familiar faces and locations and spacecraft. So for completeness you must see it. But there is a lot of deja vu. the ending leaves a lot to the imagination. The title is \"the rise of skywalker\" and at the same time we are told this is the last Star Wars movie in the series. I think it is just a continuation of the same storyline with a new twist.
