It has incredibly fun and fast-paced action from the opening crawl to the end credits. Even if there are things with the plot that arenâ€™t hashed out in the most expository detail, it is the most thrilling Star Wars film of the Disney era. Overall, the performances are great, and the force has never felt more epic.","displayName":"Grant","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:30:35.069Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:30:35.069Z","user":{"userId":"A764DB21-4401-4292-8508-9A10A82A19DD","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Grant","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I want to give it 5 stars, but i can't bring myself to.

But, I'll say that at least with Force Awakens they really had something. A defected stormtrooper, a wonderful force inspired woman, and a mysterious dark villian. What did they do with all of that? Instead we get something way out of left field. I even liked most of TLJ despite its major flaws. I should have known it was all downhill from there. At least we are at rock bottom and it can only go up from here.

But George Lucas didn't have a plan for Episodes IV thru VI... he had an outline. But obviously the Luke and Leia as brother and sister was created AFTER Empire Strikes Back. But that's kind of what makes them work, the fact that they weren't precisely planned out. That's their legacy. The prequels on the contrary were meticulously planned out, and I think that's why they didn't work. The OT will never be equaled. But I feel this trilogy did a good job at coming close and after time goes by, the kids who got to see these movies in theaters will love them all.","displayName":"Jason D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/664880254/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:29:56.653Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T03:30:57.717Z","user":{"userId":"787143986","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jason D","accountLink":"/user/id/787143986"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
