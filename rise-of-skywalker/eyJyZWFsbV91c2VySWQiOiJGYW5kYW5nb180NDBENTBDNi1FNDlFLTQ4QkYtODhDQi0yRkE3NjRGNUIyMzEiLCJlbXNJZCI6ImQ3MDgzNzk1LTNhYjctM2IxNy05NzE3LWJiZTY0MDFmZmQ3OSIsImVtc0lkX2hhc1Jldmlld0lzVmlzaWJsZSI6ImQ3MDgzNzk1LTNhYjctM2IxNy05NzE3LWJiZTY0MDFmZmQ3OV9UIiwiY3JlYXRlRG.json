Superman and Transformers than it does with the Star Wars brand. About 2 million plot points are thrown at you with a thin plot line to trying to tie them all together into something coherent. Spoiler Alert: it fails. Hardly any scenes last for more than five minutes. Nothing substantial happens. It's so far away from the formula that originally made Star Wars unique and everlasting, and the positive audience score here makes me sad that this is what the rest of the movies will be. A zippy plot with no heart. I've already forgotten about this movie, which I never thought I'd say about a new Star Wars entry.","displayName":"Tyler S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1293095345/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T20:56:46.368Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T20:56:50.605Z","user":{"userId":"823947383","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tyler S","accountLink":"/user/id/823947383"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The movie is over bloated, rushed, and gives no time for any character or plot developments to breathe. The major plot points (the big bad and main character reveal) are laughably silly. Feels like whoever made this movie didn't watch episode 7 or 8.
