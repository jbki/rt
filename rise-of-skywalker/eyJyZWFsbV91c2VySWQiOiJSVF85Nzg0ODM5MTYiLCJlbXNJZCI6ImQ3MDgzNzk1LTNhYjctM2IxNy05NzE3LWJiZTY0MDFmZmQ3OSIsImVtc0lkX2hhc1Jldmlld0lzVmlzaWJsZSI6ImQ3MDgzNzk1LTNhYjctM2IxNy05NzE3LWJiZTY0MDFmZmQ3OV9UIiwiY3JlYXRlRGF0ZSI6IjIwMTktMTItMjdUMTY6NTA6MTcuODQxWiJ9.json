Wrapped things up well which is great for a finale.

I agree with others on the visuals, It was visually stunning which only serves to further cement the Marvel movie feel. I had avoided Last Jedi due to reviews  and I regret that as I truly enjoyed Last Jedi. It had the feel of Star Wars including the samurai inspiration without bashing you over the head with \"nostalgia \" as Rise of Skywalker (And for that matter, The Force Awakens) does.","displayName":"Kevin C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T16:47:45.098Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T16:48:01.977Z","user":{"userId":"978483862","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kevin C","accountLink":"/user/id/978483862"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Was pleasantly surprised!
