I read some of the critic's reviews, and they were wrong. This is a true masterpiece fans would expect. I know it won't satisfy all Star Wars fans, but this is packed with thrills, humor, action, and heart. The ending is also great too! It's worth the ticket and a must see for all fans.

It feels like that time is used to reset from Last Jedi. Once the movie gets underway, everything comes together. There's some tremendously good action sequences, and the musical score is incredible. Nothing really feels out of place. The term \"nice save\" comes to mind. It really is an enjoyable movie.","displayName":"NL S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/520842731/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T11:37:57.732Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:43:44.573Z","user":{"userId":"908793247","realm":"RT","displayName":"NL S","accountLink":"/user/id/908793247"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Just saw this for the second time, liked it even more.

Better than I was originally anticipating. Certainly the best of the new trilogy. The bar was admittedly low and it definitely has its share of flaws. It never quite reaches the greatness of the original films.
