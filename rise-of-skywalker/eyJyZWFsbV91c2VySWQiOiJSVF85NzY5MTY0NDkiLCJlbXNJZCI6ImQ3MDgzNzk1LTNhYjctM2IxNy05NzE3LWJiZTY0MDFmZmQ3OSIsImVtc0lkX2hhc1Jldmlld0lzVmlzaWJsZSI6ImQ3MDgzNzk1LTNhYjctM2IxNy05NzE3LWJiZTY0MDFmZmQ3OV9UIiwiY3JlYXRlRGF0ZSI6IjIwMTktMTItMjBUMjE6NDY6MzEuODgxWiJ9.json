In an attempt to please everyone, Abrams ends up entertaining no one. The story is convoluted, the action non-stop and stupefying with little to no explanation given to some of the more significant developments (how exactly is the Emperor alive?). It's hard to see the sequel trilogy as nothing but a giant missed opportunity if this is the best way they could find to wrap everything up.","displayName":"Chris L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/157000055/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:46:00.748Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:46:03.722Z","user":{"userId":"782175473","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris L","accountLink":"/user/id/782175473"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!
