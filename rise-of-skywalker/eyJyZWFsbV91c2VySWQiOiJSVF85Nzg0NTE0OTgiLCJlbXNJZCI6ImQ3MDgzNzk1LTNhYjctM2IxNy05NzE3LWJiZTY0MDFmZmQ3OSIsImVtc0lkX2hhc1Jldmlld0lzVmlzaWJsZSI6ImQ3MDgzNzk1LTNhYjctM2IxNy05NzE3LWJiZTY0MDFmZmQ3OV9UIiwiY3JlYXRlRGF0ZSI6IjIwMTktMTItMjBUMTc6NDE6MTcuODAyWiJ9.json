However compared to many of the new Star Wars movies that have been released(1,2,3,8, Solo) It was really good. J.J Abrams put  out a very good movie for the hand he was dealt with The Last Jedi. Again was it perfect not at all. In fact there quite a few small things that felt unnecessary, but again they were small things. If you are a fan of the original Star Wars story I feel that you will enjoy this movie.","displayName":"Nate D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:40:54.195Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:40:54.195Z","user":{"userId":"978451441","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nate D","accountLink":"/user/id/978451441"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"it's a good ending that tied up a 9 part series that was never going to be tied up without some problems. it was fun.
