I think there was a lot covered in a short time. Possibly could have been explored further in another episode to the saga. But all in all I would see it again. Special effects were great and references to former characters always brings a smile to the audiences face.

Its a shame that these so-called professional film critics said it was below expectations and gave it an ehh rating. And Rotten Tomatoes- YOU ARE SO WRONG with your 55% rating.

The story line, the action, the original actors who appeared... left us filled with excitement and just plain joy!
