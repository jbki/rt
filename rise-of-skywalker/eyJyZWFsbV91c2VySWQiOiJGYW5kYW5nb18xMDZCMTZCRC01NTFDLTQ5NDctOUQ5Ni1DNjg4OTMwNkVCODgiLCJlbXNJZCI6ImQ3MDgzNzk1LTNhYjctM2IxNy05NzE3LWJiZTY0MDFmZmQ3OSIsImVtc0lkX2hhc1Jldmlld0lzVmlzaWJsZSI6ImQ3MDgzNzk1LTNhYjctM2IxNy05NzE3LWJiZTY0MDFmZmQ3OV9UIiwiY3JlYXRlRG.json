I enjoyed the movie, and although the ending could have been written better, overall this last movie out of the trilogy was probably the closest to the originals in terms of action and flow.  4 stars out of 5 just because the story line could have been better.","displayName":"igv","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T02:34:04.880Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T02:34:04.880Z","user":{"userId":"f2c10710-a165-433e-99d1-3a432938b7b1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"igv","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely awesome!!!!!
