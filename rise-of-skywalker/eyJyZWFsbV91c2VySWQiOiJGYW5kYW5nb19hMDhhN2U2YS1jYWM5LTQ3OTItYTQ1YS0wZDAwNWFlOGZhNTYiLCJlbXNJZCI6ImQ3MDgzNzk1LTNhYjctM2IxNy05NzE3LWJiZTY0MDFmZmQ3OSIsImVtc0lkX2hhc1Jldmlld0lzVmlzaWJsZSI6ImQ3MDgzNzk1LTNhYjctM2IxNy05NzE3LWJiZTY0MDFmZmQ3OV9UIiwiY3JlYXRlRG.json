Like the ending of any series, I have mixed emotions about it.  I'm sad to see it end, sad that the characters that I cared about are no more.   I did enjoy the movie however.  The actors were wonderful and believable even if parts of the story seemed to stretch the powers of the Force a bit far.  I just remember that this is a movie and not real life.  It's an escape from the real world, where we're allowed and encouraged to believe in the basic and intrinsic \"goodness\" of our fellow beings.","displayName":"Chuck D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T14:52:01.968Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T14:52:01.968Z","user":{"userId":"57b9e4d6-e696-411c-9296-39ced185de42","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chuck D","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"14h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"We really enjoyed it!
