I had a very bad feeling about this movie but I was very pleasantly surprised and I regained my hope; Star Wars is not lost, the battle continues. \nJokes aside. The pacing of this movie is very fast there are not 5 minutes you can take a breath, it is packed with plot or stuff that happens. That is good and bad. I got the feeling JJ tried to fit 3 movies into 1. And I bet it could have been easily 1 hour longer. There are some corny scenes but not bad ones. But there are many very good scenes! Because there is so much happening many convenient things happen to glue the plot together but I do not really mind as it keeps everything going. Considering JJ had to repair the mess TLJ left behind and end the whole saga he did an incredible job. \nDo not listen too much to these professional critics and enjoy a good and fun Star Wars movie!\nTldr: 0 to 100 real quick, fun movie. Watch as the kid you were when you discovered Star Wars not as the hardcore Fan. Just enjoy it!","displayName":"Marcus T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:22:09.819Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:22:17.275Z","user":{"userId":"978442114","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marcus T","accountLink":"/user/id/978442114"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Realmente um dos melhores da saga\nClaro tem pontos negativos, mas é um ótimo filme, encerra a saga com sucesso e INCRÍVELMENTE","displayName":"Rafael B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1877299349081301/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:21:36.478Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:22:10.669Z","user":{"userId":"978442338","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rafael B","accountLink":"/user/id/978442338"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"A wonky, bloated film that feels like director JJ Abrams was trying to fit his Episode 8 and 9 into a single film. This movie bites off more than it can chew. It's practical effects and locations were fantastic, but unexplored. The score is perfect, in every sense of the word and carries the film at every beat. There were truly some funny and heartfelt moments, but they were weighed down by recycled plot points and uninspired action. It's not Game of Thrones bad, but it's not Endgame good. It lies somewhere in the middle.","displayName":"Danny B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/514273829/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:21:22.878Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:21:30.619Z","user":{"userId":"797882030","realm":"RT","displayName":"Danny B","accountLink":"/user/id/797882030"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Sure, it's a little chaotic in moments, and crams an awful lot in, but I love it.
