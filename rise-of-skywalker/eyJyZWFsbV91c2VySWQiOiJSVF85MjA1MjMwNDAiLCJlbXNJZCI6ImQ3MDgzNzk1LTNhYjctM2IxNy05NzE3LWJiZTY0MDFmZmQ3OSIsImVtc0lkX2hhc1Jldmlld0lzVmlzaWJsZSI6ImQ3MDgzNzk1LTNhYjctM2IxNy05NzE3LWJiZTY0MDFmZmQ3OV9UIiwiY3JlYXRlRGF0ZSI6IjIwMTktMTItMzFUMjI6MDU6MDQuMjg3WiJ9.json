All around well done. I was hoping to see baby Yoda. However maybe in films to come. I'm sure we don't want to take away from Mandalorian just yet. Special Thanks to Disney for keeping on point.

A film in the series has not been so unworthy as Phantom Menace until the Rise of Skywalker.\n\nThe Mandalorian is a western re-imagined, and does a better job on the smaller screen.  Just like Solo missed the boat on the re-imagining of the swashbuckler, while Rogue One re-imagined the war trope and took it to a new level, this one misses the samurai trope by a mile and a half.\n\nIt now is  number 5, 4, 3, 8, 7,  6, 2, 9, and 1  a sub par ending to the Skywalker Saga when 7 was a rehash but well done, and 8 was reimagining that should have setup 9 for the ending to end all endings if only they had had the imagination on the one end and the clarity of thought to fulfill a proper samurai ending in the other.\n\nRun away from this unworthy calamity.  If you want poor editing, rushed pacing, and unimaginative CGI combined with uncreative story telling go see it.  If you were hoping for an Akiro sweeping overview and Toshiro precipice driven angst and yet triumphant denouement then this is a disappointment of gargantuan proportions.","displayName":"Xose P-P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T22:00:54.030Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T22:00:54.030Z","user":{"userId":"c0d29a07-bf46-425a-b680-b2e7fc7897b9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Xose P-P","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Thought that the flaws in the film were easily overlooked and there was a warm sense of closure with the film.
