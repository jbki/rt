If that is fan service then Lucasfilm is guilty but this is a very good film nonetheless.  They had a lot to tie up and they were successful and the bonus was there is no time for downtime!  Always moving forward!  Long film but needed just about every scene.  Some may wonder about Leia's use but I thought it was seamless and didn't detract.  In fact, I thought it was therapeutic to see her in the saga's finale.  If you are a Star Wars fan and like seeing Star Wars films this is one of the best in awhile.  If you have not liked Star Wars films of late this probably won't please you...but it may.","displayName":"David H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000924617047/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T12:10:30.184Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T12:10:44.871Z","user":{"userId":"906221272","realm":"RT","displayName":"David H","accountLink":"/user/id/906221272"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Pointless, utterly pointless","displayName":"Max","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T12:08:54.541Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T12:08:54.541Z","user":{"userId":"f3fac97c-7def-4a00-9252-2fc1449cc428","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Max","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I think it was the perfect end to the saga. The movie had me focused every minute from the beginning, there were a lot of twists that I didn't see coming but that totally fit within the story and I just really enjoyed it in general. It also felt fresh in a good way and some actors (Ridley, Isaac, Driver, ...) really proved themselves again to be worthy of playing in such an amazing movie.","displayName":"Victor V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T12:08:42.303Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T12:08:44.317Z","user":{"userId":"978479657","realm":"RT","displayName":"Victor V","accountLink":"/user/id/978479657"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"}]}
