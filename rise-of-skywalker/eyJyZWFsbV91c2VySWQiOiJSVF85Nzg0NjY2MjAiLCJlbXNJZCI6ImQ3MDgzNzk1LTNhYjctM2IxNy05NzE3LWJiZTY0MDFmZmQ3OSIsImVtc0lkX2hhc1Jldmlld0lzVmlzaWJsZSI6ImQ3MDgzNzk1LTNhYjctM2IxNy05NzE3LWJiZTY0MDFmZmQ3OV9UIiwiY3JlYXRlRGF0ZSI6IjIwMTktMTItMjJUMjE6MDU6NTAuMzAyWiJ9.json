Reminds me so much of seeing the original Star Wars when I was a kid.  Not as deep or good as Last Jedi - the best movie of the final trilogy (FIGHT ME!!) - but deeply satisfying.  \nCritics complaining about too much going on or it being confusing should avoid every watching The Sting - their brains will explode.  The 8 year old next to me had no problems keeping up.  A lot of critics should find new jobs, that they can be good at.","displayName":"Steven F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:05:45.053Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:05:45.053Z","user":{"userId":"978466607","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steven F","accountLink":"/user/id/978466607"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"A black hole of plot holes, wooden acting, Rise of Mary Sue, Palpatine plot line is in a universe of stupidity.","displayName":"Carlos K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:05:36.486Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:05:39.660Z","user":{"userId":"977335988","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carlos K","accountLink":"/user/id/977335988"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best star wars movies. Fan service is what we want and JJ Abrams delivered. The movie also un-did all the horrible story decisions from the Last Jedi. The shots in this film are absolutely exhilarating and for the first time in 9 films, you truly get a sense of the scale of technology and the full extent of force abilities.","displayName":"Jimmy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:05:34.485Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:05:34.485Z","user":{"userId":"90d02288-2954-4015-acbe-c4a843195a06","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jimmy","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"CGI borefest with storyline for 3 year old","displayName":"Yke v","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10153158054253836/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:04:52.544Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:04:58.644Z","user":{"userId":"971886027","realm":"RT","displayName":"Yke v","accountLink":"/user/id/971886027"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Itâ€™s a good finish to the Skywalker series","displayName":"Barry","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:04:44.865Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:04:44.865Z","user":{"userId":"4FFEDC23-C0DE-416D-AC08-85BD79C0BD9A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Barry","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Agree that the film is a little too fast and choppy in the beginning checking in with everyone's storylines, but to me, felt very Return of the Jedi, which arrives on Endor faster than most kids remember. What many critics viewed as \"retcons\" I saw as great character arc twists rather than \"correcting\" The Last Jedi. Star Wars has always been loaded with misdirections and misinformation, prophecies not to be taken at face value. Storytelling-wise, I think this film did a great job, and unlike most other movies that came out this year that were a little self-indulgent in the editing room, this film could've actually probably used another 20-30 minutes to let the emotions breathe and sink in their finality before being cast into another whirlwind section of the adventure.","displayName":"Raymond C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2269853590238/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:04:36.743Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T02:54:27.501Z","user":{"userId":"977423233","realm":"RT","displayName":"Raymond C","accountLink":"/user/id/977423233"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I went in with super low expectations.
