It was overwhelmed and kind of plain but satisfying with what JJ Abrams had to work with with the mess up blunders with Rian Johnson Ep 8. That he had to hammer fist,recon and fast foward  all he wanted for this trilogy so he played it really safe with the fans that were insulted in episode 8 to play it really well with massive fan services. I hope this is a lesson not to do an the Disney Star War futures.","displayName":"Matthew L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:11:24.345Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:11:24.345Z","user":{"userId":"ECEB1D35-4A26-420A-B999-7B4FD875BE27","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Matthew L","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Dismissed all logic and historical rules set by the previous movies.
