It had some cool moments but most of it was random. And there was a pattern: someone dies, somebody kisses someone for no reason, then another death, then another kiss. They really tried to please the fans with some references to the original movies. However, half the time I was wondering if I am watching Star Wars or a random Disney movie.","displayName":" ","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100003348507358/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:53:35.077Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:53:44.429Z","user":{"userId":"949499640","realm":"RT","displayName":" ","accountLink":"/user/id/949499640"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Against all odds, JJ absolutely nailed this movie! I was mesmerised back in 77 as a 5 year old kid during episode 4 and again tonight watching episode 9, I was totally captivated, ending the Skywalker saga on a massive high.\nHow our Princess was handled was absolutely perfect, the movie looked incredible, the cast were all amazing and John Williams score, as always, was consistently awesome. I left the theatre this evening with a tear in my eye and a huge grin on my face.\nMy 13 year old daughter scored the film 10/10, my 18 year old son 8.5/10, my wife 9/10 and for me it was a perfect 5 star experience. I'm going back to see it again tomorrow, to once again take in that stunningly beautiful final Star Wars shot, in all it's emotional glory.\nStar Wars has been a massive part of my life and tonight the saga ended with me feeling full of wonder, awe and absolute total satisfaction; thanks JJ.\nOnce again the majority of movie critics have demonstrated their irrelevance!","displayName":"scott s","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:53:31.599Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:53:38.263Z","user":{"userId":"937642856","realm":"RT","displayName":"scott s","accountLink":"/user/id/937642856"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"spent most of the time thinking how to express \"?????\" irl","displayName":"Iara Q","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1076268502513599/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:53:17.320Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:53:24.479Z","user":{"userId":"976932424","realm":"RT","displayName":"Iara Q","accountLink":"/user/id/976932424"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This is a whole lot of movie.
