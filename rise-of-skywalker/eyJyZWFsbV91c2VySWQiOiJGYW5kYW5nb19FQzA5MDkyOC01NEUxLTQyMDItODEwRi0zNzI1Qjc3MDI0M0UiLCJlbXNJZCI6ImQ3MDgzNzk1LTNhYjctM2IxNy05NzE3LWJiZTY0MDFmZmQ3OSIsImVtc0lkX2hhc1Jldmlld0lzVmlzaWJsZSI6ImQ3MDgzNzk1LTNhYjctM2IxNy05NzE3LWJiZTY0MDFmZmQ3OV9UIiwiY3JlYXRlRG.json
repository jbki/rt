This film successfully annihilated everything the original trilogy, and the prequel trilogy (no matter how horrible), built/established with Luke, Leia, Anakin/Vader (the Skywalker's). The film felt rushed, the dialogue was sub par, and the ending ruined the Star Wars/Skywalker legacy. The only new character that I liked \n and wanted to survive, died. On a positive note, the special effects were good and I enjoyed the lightsaber fights between Kylo/Ben and Rey.","displayName":"Autumn W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T12:23:50.193Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T12:23:50.193Z","user":{"userId":"2f3a355e-836c-4769-bd4e-ff64c9d66e16","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Autumn W","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The ending was ok.\nCould have been better","displayName":"Julianne","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T12:23:46.490Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T12:23:46.490Z","user":{"userId":"ac840a49-48ec-433c-bcdd-09f8e4d20868","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Julianne","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fantastic, no regrets of ticket purchase at all!","displayName":"Anakin L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T12:22:01.489Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T12:22:03.800Z","user":{"userId":"978483177","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anakin L","accountLink":"/user/id/978483177"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I liked that they explained a lot.
