They tried to throw everything but the kitchen sink and see what stuck and sadly none of it did. Arcs happen within the same scene at times and mostly nothing is explained properly, especially the emperor's return. And don't get me started on the complete train wreck they caused trying to make Rey a somebody. I went in with such high hopes after the last Jedi, but sadly left feeling nothing at all. I wish I could get my 2 hours back honestly.","displayName":"Kyle W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1321046210/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T16:27:33.384Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T16:27:45.259Z","user":{"userId":"831403898","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kyle W","accountLink":"/user/id/831403898"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"One of the worst movies of the year.

The plot is ridiculous and non sensical even for a Star Wars film. It does have some good nostalgic moments and a great comic relief character. I was also surprised by the great practical effects. Aside from that it's really predictable and waisted a great plot twist due to poor planning.
