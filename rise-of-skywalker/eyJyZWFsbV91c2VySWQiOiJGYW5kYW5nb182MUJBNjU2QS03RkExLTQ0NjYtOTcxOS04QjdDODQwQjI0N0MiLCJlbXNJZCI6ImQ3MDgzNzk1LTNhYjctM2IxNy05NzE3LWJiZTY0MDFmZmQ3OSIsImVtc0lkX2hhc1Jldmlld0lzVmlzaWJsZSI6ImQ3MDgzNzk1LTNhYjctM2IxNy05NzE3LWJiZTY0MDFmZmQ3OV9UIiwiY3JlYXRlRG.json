This is a fun movie with great action and nice emotional beats. At this point I struggle to understand what people want from a Star Wars movie. Great action? Check. Charming actors? Check.

This includes older movies, animated shows and novels. The ending was the most satisfying thing of all as it really delivered. I would of scored it higher but due to the amount of retconning from the previous movie, it not only answered a lot of questions but raised new ones so you know what that means. The Force could of been greater but it was good enough.
