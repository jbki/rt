This ham fisted, self indulgent unimaginative, lazy film is a travesty and not worthy of inclusion in the Star Wars franchise. The only redeeming feature is John Williams Score. Episodes 7,8 and 9 will be remembered only for their contribution to Disney's balance sheet rather than for their sad association with the greatest story in cinematic history.","displayName":"David B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:27:56.557Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:28:00.539Z","user":{"userId":"970199085","realm":"RT","displayName":"David B","accountLink":"/user/id/970199085"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"this was by far the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen I am embarrassed that they actually made this.
