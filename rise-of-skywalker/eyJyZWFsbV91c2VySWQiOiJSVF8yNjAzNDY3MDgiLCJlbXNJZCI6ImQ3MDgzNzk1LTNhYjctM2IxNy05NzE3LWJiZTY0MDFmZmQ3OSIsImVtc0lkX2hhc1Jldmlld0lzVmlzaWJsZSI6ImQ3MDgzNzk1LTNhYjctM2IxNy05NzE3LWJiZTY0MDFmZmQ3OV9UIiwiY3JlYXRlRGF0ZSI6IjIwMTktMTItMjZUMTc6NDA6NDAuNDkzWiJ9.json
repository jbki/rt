This was a Star Wars movie and a good one at that.  This isn't Shakespeare, folks.  It isn't intended to be.  It's supposed to be fun and end Rey's story arc.  It does so without trying too hard, like Last Jedi did.","displayName":"Walter K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/120488632770641/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:39:47.225Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:39:55.490Z","user":{"userId":"978480430","realm":"RT","displayName":"Walter K","accountLink":"/user/id/978480430"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A few items were not explained well.","displayName":"Chris Galambos","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:38:49.812Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:38:49.812Z","user":{"userId":"a704bfa3-4300-4bcb-865f-ae559096c788","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chris Galambos","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Very solid movie and in my opinion a great way to end the saga, considering what Abrams had to work with after The Last Jedi.
