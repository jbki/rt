Episode 9 provides a pleasing end of the saga, but also leaves the door open for future stories. \nThe biggest problem with this movie was its pacing. It was way too quick at points, and would've had a larger emotional impact if it took its time. Splitting TROS into 2 parts would have really helped this movie come across better. The movie also had some missed opportunities that would have made it so much better. \nOverall, this is not a bad star wars movie. Its action packed and tells a compelling story.","displayName":"T M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T23:05:11.847Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T02:06:22.335Z","user":{"userId":"978493135","realm":"RT","displayName":"T M","accountLink":"/user/id/978493135"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"By far the best Star Wars conclusion ever.
