They complain about the \"unnecessary course correction\" from the most hated movie of the entire franchise and bemoan a \"lack of imagination\" in a movie which shows more creativity than the previous two movies combined.\n\nRise of Skywalker is the movie that the fans wanted and deserved. Where Johnson seemingly tried to kill the franchise with his abomination of a film, Abrams has saved it. The story concludes in a dramatic, exciting, and satisfying manner with this film.\n\nOverall, in terms of overall quality, Rise of Skywalker sits somewhere between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. It irritates critics seemingly by placing good storytelling at the top of the list of its priorities, above the unwanted social commentary we got with Last Jedi.\n\nIf there is one complaint I have with this film it's that the scenes with Leia feel completely wrong. Almost like the other actors in the scene are acting against footage shot for an entirely different movie with an actress who isn't there (imagine that). Seriously though, they did a somewhat less than stellar job inserting the late Carrie Fisher into this film. I realize they had to work with what they had, but the end result was not great for those scenes.\n\nIn short: the critics panning this movie are idiots, which we already knew after they so heavily praised the train wreck that was Last Jedi.","displayName":"Kris S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000100073893/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T15:35:34.011Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T15:35:42.753Z","user":{"userId":"905955599","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kris S","accountLink":"/user/id/905955599"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"13h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved the action.
