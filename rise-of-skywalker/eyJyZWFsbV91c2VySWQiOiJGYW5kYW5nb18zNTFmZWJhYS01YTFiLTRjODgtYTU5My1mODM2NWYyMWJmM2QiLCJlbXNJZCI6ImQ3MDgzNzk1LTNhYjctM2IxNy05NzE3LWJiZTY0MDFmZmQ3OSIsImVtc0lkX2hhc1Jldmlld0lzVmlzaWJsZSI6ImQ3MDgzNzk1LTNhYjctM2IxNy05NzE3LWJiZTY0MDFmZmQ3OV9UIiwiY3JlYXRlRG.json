This film does its best to tow the line of fan service versus casual viewer.  I am in the former category (i.e. nerd), and I enjoyed this movie and thought it was a good wrap-up for the series.  Plenty of plot holes, questionable story choices, and open ends, but unless we want a 6 hour movie (or 2 parts like HP), this 2.5 hour movie does a good job of tackling that Herculean challenge. \n\nIf you want more fan service, read the comics or the books.  Movies are for the masses and should be enjoyed as such.\n\nBut, what do I know?  I liked The Last Jedi.  :)","displayName":"Eric K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T12:59:36.930Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T12:59:36.930Z","user":{"userId":"568f4fc0-7968-49f8-965f-c9d6a07c522c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Eric K","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"16h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was great action packed fun to go see with the family!","displayName":"Samantha  R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T12:58:10.068Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T12:58:10.068Z","user":{"userId":"b0508d15-a37e-4a29-b3ae-f3a63aa5ba97","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Samantha  R","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"16h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Way better than I anticipated!
