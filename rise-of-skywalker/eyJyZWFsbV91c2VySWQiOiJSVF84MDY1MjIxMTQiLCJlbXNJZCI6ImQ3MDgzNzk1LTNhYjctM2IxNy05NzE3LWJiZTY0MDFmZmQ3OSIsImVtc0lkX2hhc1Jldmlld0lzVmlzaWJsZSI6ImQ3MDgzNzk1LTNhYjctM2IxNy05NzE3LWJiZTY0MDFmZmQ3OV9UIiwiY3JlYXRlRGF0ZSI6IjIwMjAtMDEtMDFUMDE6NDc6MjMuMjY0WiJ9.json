The acting by Adam Driver was excellent as usual and John Boyega was much better than in previous films. The movie strays a bit away from past Star Wars movies and has answers for questions we’ve all had that seemed a bit hasty.

Basically Rise, like ROTJ, has a lot of action and not enough plot / character exposition in the rush to finish things up.
