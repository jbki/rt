Since the controversy over The Last Jedi (which included bots trolling the ratings of that movie on this website), no review of this film should be taken as absolute truth. Attack of the clones has a 65% rating. Revenge of the Sith has an 80% rating. So take the score with a bit fat grain of sand...Everyone knows those are the worst Star Wars movies EVER.\n\nCertainly in the weeks and months following the release of Rise of Skywalker, many people will try to explain to you why it sucks for this reason or that. It doesn't suck. It's a well made film, the acting is solid, the execution is solid and the plot is about as unoffensive as it could be given that it is trying to appease both Last Jedi haters and the rest of us who still like Star Wars. But overall, it threads the needle reasonably well and left me feeling satisfied. Daisy Ridley gives her best performance as Rey yet and the way they incorporated Carrie Fisher into the film felt was great. Leia is awesome in the movie!","displayName":"Patrick B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:18:02.637Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:18:02.637Z","user":{"userId":"978453211","realm":"RT","displayName":"Patrick B","accountLink":"/user/id/978453211"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"it a really good movie.","displayName":"Donald S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:18:02.154Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:18:02.154Z","user":{"userId":"AF563F92-5F81-40C0-B3E1-84ABCA980131","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Donald S","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was a wonderful way to finish 42 years of tripletriology!","displayName":"Gregory  H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:17:53.112Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:18:03.165Z","user":{"userId":"978277646","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gregory  H","accountLink":"/user/id/978277646"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"So hard to say how utterly disappointing these movies have become.
