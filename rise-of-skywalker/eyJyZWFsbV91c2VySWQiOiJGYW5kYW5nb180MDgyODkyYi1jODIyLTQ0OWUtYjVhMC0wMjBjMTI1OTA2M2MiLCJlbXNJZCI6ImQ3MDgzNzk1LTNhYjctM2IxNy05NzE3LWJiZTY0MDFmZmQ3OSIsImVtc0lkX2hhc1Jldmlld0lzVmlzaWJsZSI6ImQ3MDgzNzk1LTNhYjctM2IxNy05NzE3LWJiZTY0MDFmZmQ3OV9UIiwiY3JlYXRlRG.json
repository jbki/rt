I have to say they have redeemed themselves in my eyes. It wasn't a master piece but I really did end up enjoying it. I didn't leave in disgust, I didn't want my money back. The story is nothing new, but all the actors benefit from a better script. Fight scenes and space battles are exciting and I was not distracted by any obvious miss cuts or timing issues. I really liked how they handled certain characters with respect. I don't know if its just because of the previous one, but the fan service was very welcomed. Talking about other things happening in the universe and including a few things that made parts of the previous extended universe cannon. Over all it was worth the price of admission.","displayName":"AMY K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T16:53:38.966Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T16:53:38.966Z","user":{"userId":"1695b2e6-dc63-4637-a5f8-dae77d3992f1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"AMY K","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Terrible stars wars movie that ruins the franchise with all the stupid plot lines.","displayName":"Nicholas H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T16:53:32.639Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T16:53:38.961Z","user":{"userId":"976069629","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nicholas H","accountLink":"/user/id/976069629"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fantastic movie! It was a great way to wrap up the story arc. Didn’t go like I anticipated but that’s part of the reason I loved it! Too many people hate a movie because it doesn’t go like THEY WANT and that’s a shame. Anyway, there was plenty of nostalgic moments and some great emotional ones as well. And we finally got one that’s longer than an hour and a half!

I enjoyed the movie for what it is but it was not a great ending to a 9 film saga. Plot holes everywhere, character building done off screen, no major lightsaber duel, many flaws, also they basically hinted a plot line of stormtrooper turned jedi but just ignored it.

This movie was made for us, THE FANS.  it was made by a man who appreciates star wars because he is a fan first, director/producer second.  Watching this on the 19th was transcendent.
