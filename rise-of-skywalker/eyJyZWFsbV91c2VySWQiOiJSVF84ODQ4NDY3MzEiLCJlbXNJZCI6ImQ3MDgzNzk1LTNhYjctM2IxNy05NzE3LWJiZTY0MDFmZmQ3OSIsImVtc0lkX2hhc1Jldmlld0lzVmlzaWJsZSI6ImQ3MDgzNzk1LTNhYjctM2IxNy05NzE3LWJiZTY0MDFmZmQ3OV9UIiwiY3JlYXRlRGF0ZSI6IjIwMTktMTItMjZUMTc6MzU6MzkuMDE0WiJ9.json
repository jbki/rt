The weak narrative structure left me feeling bored, a frustrating and surprising response to a sequel filled with innumerable new characters and visually stunning worlds that ran so hurriedly to meet its disappointing conclusion.","displayName":"Madeline B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:35:02.771Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:35:06.231Z","user":{"userId":"978480365","realm":"RT","displayName":"Madeline B","accountLink":"/user/id/978480365"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"A movie designed for small children who donâ€™t know any better.","displayName":"Erica","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:34:09.353Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:34:09.353Z","user":{"userId":"F8339046-2108-4E70-8406-0B60FBC26A62","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Erica","accountLink":null},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I liked the good sense of humor throughout movie.

It felt like JJ Abrams was trying to cram his vision of the trilogy into one movie except he didn't have the time or the actors he needed anymore. Lots of really great ideas sprinkled throughout the movie but unfortunately they didn't get the time or exposition they deserved. Instead they were too busy rushing towards and anti-climatic ending.","displayName":"Ryan N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10152390683809470/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:33:12.094Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:33:19.538Z","user":{"userId":"978440692","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan N","accountLink":"/user/id/978440692"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Star Wars has now become a parody of itself.","displayName":"Valery M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:32:05.805Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:32:23.928Z","user":{"userId":"968968549","realm":"RT","displayName":"Valery M","accountLink":"/user/id/968968549"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Pop corn movie.

I went through so many emotions. Mainly, happy tears and awe. It defines what the purpose behind these 9 movies have been about. Not on a deep, meaningful level, but about the rivalry of the ultimate good vs the ultimate evil. Two sides of the same coin that flip throughout the generations. Beautiful movie with a lot of satisfaction.","displayName":"Caige C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2422698427992595/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:31:38.880Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:31:46.730Z","user":{"userId":"978480414","realm":"RT","displayName":"Caige C","accountLink":"/user/id/978480414"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"}]}
