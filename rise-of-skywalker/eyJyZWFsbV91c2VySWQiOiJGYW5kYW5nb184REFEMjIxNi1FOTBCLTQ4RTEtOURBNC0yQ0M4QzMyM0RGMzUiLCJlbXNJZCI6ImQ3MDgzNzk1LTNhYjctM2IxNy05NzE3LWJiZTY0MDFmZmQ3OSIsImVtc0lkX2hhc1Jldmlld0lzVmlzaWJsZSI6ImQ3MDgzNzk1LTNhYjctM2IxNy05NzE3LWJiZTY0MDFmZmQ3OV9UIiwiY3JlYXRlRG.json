They are the people that give you money after all.","displayName":"Jacob F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/857445245/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T14:56:18.069Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T14:56:26.494Z","user":{"userId":"860091226","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jacob F","accountLink":"/user/id/860091226"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"14h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This is only parody for old movie","displayName":"Alexander D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T14:54:24.390Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T14:54:24.390Z","user":{"userId":"978500686","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alexander D","accountLink":"/user/id/978500686"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"14h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Not the best not the worst but far better than the last movie imho","displayName":"Daddoo","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T14:54:15.774Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T14:54:15.774Z","user":{"userId":"8B4A8B7C-5F64-4DA7-8461-242E4C1F9B3E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Daddoo","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"14h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Way too many characters (do we need yet another droid, resistance member, alien who may be good/bad?) who have little to do and that we don't care about, recycled dialogue and scenarios (cantina, space worm, asteroids, battle scenes?) from the \"good\" Star Wars movies (Episodes 4-6).
