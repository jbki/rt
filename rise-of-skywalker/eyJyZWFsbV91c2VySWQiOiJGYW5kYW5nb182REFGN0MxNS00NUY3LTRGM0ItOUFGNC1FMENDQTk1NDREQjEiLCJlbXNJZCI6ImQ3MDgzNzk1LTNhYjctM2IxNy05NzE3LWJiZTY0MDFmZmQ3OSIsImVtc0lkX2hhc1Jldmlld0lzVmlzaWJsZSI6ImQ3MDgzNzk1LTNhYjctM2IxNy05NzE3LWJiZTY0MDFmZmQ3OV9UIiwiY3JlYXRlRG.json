The film specifically shines when Rey, Finn, and Poe are together. Adam Driver‘s performance is savage. The young cast really does help rejuvenate the franchise and i look forward to what lies ahead for all of them (regardless if they will/will not be featured again in a galaxy far, far away).\n\nAll in all, it's a Star Wars movie. And i for one am thankful i get to experience them on the silver screen.\n\nPS: Props to Anthony Daniels. He absolutely crushed it.","displayName":"Johnfrank D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10621600/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T17:39:43.614Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T06:25:25.789Z","user":{"userId":"783675036","realm":"RT","displayName":"Johnfrank D","accountLink":"/user/id/783675036"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best of all Star Wars movies.....awesome!","displayName":"Augustine","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T17:39:31.135Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T17:39:31.135Z","user":{"userId":"f4d47216-2988-46d3-a7e4-930d275ca452","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Augustine","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"As a Star Wars fan since as early as I can remember I feel this film brilliantly delivered on the nostalgia & fan service from its predecessors, all the way down to the music score which to me personally was a lovely treat. There were a few unexpected twists and turns along the way, but to conclude; this movie was the perfect send off paying respects to an older generation whilst also inviting the new with welcoming arms. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the ride, and we are ready to see which direction Disney takes us to expand on what we've grown to love all these years.","displayName":"Mike R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T17:39:20.311Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T17:43:01.512Z","user":{"userId":"978465612","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike R","accountLink":"/user/id/978465612"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"}]}
