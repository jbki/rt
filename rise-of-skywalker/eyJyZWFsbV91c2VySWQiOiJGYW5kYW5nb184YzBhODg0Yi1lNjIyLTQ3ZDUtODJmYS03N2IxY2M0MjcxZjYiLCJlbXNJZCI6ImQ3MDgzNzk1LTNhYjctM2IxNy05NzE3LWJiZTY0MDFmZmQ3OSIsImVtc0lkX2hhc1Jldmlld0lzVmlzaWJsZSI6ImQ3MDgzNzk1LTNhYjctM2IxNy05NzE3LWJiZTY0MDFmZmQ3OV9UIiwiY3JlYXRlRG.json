The movie felt really rushed, like 2 movies crammed into one. I understand this was because of the things The Last Jedi didn't address. I also didn't understand what was going on most of the time. I thought I was set just by watching the other 2 movies in the trilogy but no it's not enough. It's like Avengers Endgame, you must have watched at least 10 other films.","displayName":"Ace V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T05:32:48.654Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T05:32:50.899Z","user":{"userId":"978478963","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ace V","accountLink":"/user/id/978478963"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Worst Star wars movie ever.","displayName":"Roberto P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2230435820345003/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T05:32:45.661Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T05:32:54.854Z","user":{"userId":"977832765","realm":"RT","displayName":"Roberto P","accountLink":"/user/id/977832765"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Fun, if you completely disregard any attempt to tie together a meaningful plot or character development.

Total Star Wars visual mastery. I get it. However, the plot has so many cliches and silly conveniences that just make you laugh. Then there is that hokey thing about the franchise. This oh-so-silly pantomime evil defeats good and cackling bad guys etc. Oh how silly. I just really lost respect for it all about a third of the way in. Little silly plot twists. Oh how daft!
