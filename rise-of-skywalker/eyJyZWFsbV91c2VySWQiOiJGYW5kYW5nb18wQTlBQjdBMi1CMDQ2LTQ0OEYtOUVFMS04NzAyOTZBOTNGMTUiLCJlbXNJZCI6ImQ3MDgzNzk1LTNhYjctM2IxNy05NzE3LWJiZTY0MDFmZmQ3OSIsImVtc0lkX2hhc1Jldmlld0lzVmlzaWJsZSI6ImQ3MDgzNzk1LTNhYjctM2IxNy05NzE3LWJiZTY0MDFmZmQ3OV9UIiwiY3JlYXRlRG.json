Felt like watching an episode of TV after missing a few episodes, like you missed a piece of the story no one is talking about anymore.  \n\nDialog was very cringe in a lot of spots, humour was forced and un-funny, and you can see the cinematography was very cut and paste from other Star Wars movies.","displayName":"Gerry M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T17:55:50.815Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T17:55:59.979Z","user":{"userId":"973885571","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gerry M","accountLink":"/user/id/973885571"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Over plotted and underdeveloped, but darn fun to watch.

I enjoyed the character development and plot choices Abrams made to wrap everything up and left only wishing he would have had creative control over all 3 to make a truly great trilogy. Sure there are some corny moments and cringe worthy lines, but what Star Wars movie doesn't have those? I believe there are far more moments that any fan's emotions will be elicited for the better. That being said the originals are still far suppieor, but I believe time will show 7,8,9 > 1,2,3 with 5 still at the top.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T17:54:50.070Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T17:54:50.070Z","user":{"userId":"260102453","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260102453"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This movie is getting a lot of hate online, but I found it to be much better than the last one.
