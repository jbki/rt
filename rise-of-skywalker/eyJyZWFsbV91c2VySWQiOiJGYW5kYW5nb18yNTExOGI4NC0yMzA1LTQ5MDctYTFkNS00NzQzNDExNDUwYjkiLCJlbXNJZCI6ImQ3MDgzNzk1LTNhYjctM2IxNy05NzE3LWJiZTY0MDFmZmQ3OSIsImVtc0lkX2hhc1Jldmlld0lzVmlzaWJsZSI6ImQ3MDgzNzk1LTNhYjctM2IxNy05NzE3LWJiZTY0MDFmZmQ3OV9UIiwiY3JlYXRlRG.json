You can sense that Disney's corporate panic mode is fully operation after the commercial failures of Solo and The Last Jedi (which, disclaimer, I thought weren't nearly as bad as they were received). This film attempts to do too much plot-wise in the time that it has, losing focus of key themes and arcs that were begun in The Last Jedi, and leaving many scenes confusing and at times absurd.","displayName":"Akio H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T04:33:07.299Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T04:34:38.092Z","user":{"userId":"977017712","realm":"RT","displayName":"Akio H","accountLink":"/user/id/977017712"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 03, 2020"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Diehard Star Wars fans will like this.
