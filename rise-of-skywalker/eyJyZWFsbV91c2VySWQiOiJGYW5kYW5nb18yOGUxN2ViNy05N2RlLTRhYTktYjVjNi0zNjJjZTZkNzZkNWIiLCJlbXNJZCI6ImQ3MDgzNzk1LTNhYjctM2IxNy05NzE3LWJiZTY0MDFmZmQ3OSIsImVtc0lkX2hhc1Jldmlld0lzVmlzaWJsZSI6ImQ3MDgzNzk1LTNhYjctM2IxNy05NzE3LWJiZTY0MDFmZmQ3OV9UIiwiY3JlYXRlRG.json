This movie should be ranked somewhere in the middle of all SW movies, towards the bottom. It's definitely better than TPM, AOTC, & Solo.

And given that Abrams wanted to pay homage to each and every previous \"Star Wars\" instalment, which was a bold choice, one could almost invariably spot imperfections. Even so, his direction is spot-on as ever and upon investing one's time in multiple viewings of this film, one may just find that where dialogue falters, visual storytelling compensates.","displayName":"Jonathan V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T03:11:23.087Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T03:12:08.617Z","user":{"userId":"978497433","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonathan V","accountLink":"/user/id/978497433"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Awful.
