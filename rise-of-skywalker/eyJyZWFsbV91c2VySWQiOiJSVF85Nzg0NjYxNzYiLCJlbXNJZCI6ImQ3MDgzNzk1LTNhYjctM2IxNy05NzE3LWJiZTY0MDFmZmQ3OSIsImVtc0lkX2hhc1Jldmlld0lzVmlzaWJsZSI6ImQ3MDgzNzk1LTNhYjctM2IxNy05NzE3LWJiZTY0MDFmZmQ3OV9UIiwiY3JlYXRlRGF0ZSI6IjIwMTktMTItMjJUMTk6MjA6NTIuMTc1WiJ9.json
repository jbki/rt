It's action packed, great.  It makes the fans happy, fantastic.  This was a great movie.  I saw it 3d IMAX which was the way to see it.  It saves the franchise and ends it in a good way.  I enjoyed every second of it and so did my husband.  Go see it,  it's a great movie.  I already have my 3d bluray on preorder.","displayName":"Heidi H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/798379630/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:20:14.910Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:21:12.579Z","user":{"userId":"971383044","realm":"RT","displayName":"Heidi H","accountLink":"/user/id/971383044"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome ending to an iconic saga!!!
