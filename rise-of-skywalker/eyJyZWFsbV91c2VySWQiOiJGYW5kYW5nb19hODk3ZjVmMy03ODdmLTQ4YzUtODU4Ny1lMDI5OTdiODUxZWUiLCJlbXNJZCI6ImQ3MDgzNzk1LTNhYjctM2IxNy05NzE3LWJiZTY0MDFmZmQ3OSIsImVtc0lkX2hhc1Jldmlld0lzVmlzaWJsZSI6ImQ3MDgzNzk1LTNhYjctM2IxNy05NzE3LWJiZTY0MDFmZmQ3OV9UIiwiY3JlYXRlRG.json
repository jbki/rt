First 30 minutes: action non-stop with chopped editing. The additional 30 minutes of the hour: the story slowed down. The rest of the film: Went crazy town. At this point, all I was doing was digging in my purse for my cigarette lighter. \nSome jokes were good. Like the banter about Poe being a spice runner, humor had its moments. \nHowever, a complete travesty of writing. It's like 16 different people wrote this movie & didn't speak to one another. Too much fan service, thrown together with 1980's tacky glue. We had the wake with TLJ, now the funeral with ROS. \n\nThe only sustaining factor is \"The Mandalorian\" for SW, because without this series...not much to speak of with Disney Star Wars.","displayName":"Lotus Underground","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T14:27:36.907Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T14:27:36.907Z","user":{"userId":"78e721cc-b49c-4519-adf0-d27432b9924b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Lotus Underground","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"First half - promising.
