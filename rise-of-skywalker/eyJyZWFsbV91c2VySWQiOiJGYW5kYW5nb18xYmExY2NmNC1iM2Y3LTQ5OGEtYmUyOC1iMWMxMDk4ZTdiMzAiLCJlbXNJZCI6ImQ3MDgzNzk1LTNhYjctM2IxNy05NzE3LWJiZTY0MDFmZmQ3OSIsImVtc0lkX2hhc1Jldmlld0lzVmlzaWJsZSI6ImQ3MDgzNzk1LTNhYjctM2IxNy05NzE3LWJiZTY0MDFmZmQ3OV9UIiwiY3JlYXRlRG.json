The special effects were as good as I've ever seen. But if Lucasfilm/Disney does another, I suggest spending more effort on the writing, and less on the eye-candy. \n\nAs an aside to Rotten Tomatoes, if you're going to provide falsified audience scores, I suggest you vary them a bit up and down around your preselected number as the total rises. It would make it more believable.","displayName":"Richard G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:04:01.897Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:04:05.342Z","user":{"userId":"959350746","realm":"RT","displayName":"Richard G","accountLink":"/user/id/959350746"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Only good in the sense that TLJ set a really low bar. It's a rushed through attempt to try and salvage what TFA started. \n\nIn comparison to the rest of the franchise the action is dumb, the characters flat, and story emotionless. One of those things were \"just give me a synopsis\" would be an adequate alternative to sitting through it.","displayName":"Judson W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:03:59.904Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:04:07.230Z","user":{"userId":"976928705","realm":"RT","displayName":"Judson W","accountLink":"/user/id/976928705"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I have watched it twice. The first time I wasn't sure if I liked it. The second time I saw it I freaking loved it. I didn't like that Rose wasn't seen being the spokesperson for the Everyman in the StarWars universe. I feel like Rey's story had to be what it was, and I wish I could see more of Ben Solo. Adam Driver acted his butt off, and I loved it.","displayName":"Susan S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:03:57.740Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:04:05.524Z","user":{"userId":"978461030","realm":"RT","displayName":"Susan S","accountLink":"/user/id/978461030"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Fantastic!
