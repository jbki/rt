I honestly do not like the new star wars trilogy, and this one is probably my favorite, honestly. It requires you not to think, but beyond several logical inconsistencies, it's a really fun and entertaining movie. Tfa was too much carbon copy of a new hope, and tlj was almost disrespectful in the way it handled the material, and I think this movie finally hits its stride. There are several places where the pacing and the plot choices felt stiff and overpacked, but overall, definitely a good watch. The spectacle is grand, and the showpieces do inspire awe.","displayName":"Larry L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/748266662337585/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T22:07:02.884Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T22:07:09.119Z","user":{"userId":"978466856","realm":"RT","displayName":"Larry L","accountLink":"/user/id/978466856"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie after disliking The Last Jedi.
