It's like a video game where the characters have to do side quests, collecting an item and going from Point A to Point B. It didn't flow organically. \n\nThe movie would've been more enjoyable for me if they focused on Rey and Kylo's relationship. The rest of the supporting characters were underutilize and underdeveloped. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver's scenes together is one of the few things I liked about the movie.","displayName":"Kevin B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001200033889/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T05:40:15.195Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:27:17.432Z","user":{"userId":"923686940","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kevin B","accountLink":"/user/id/923686940"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Rest In PEACE Star Wars Lore.

First, my view hasn't changed.  I absolutely and thoroughly enjoyed the film.  \n\nIt is not a perfect film by any means.  There is a lot going on in the movie.  A lot.  It's constantly flowing from dire situation to dire situation without much reprieve in between.  There are a few plot holes but overall I found it to be a love letter to fans both new and old in that it does a good job of concluding the forty plus years of the Skywalker Saga.\n\nThe question regarding whether the Sequel Trilogy needed to be made at all will continue to be debated.  In a way, the Saga could have remained the original six movies and that would have been quite fine.  While it was great to see my childhood heroes again, seeing their demise as the movies went on was painful to see.  \n\nWhat is clear is that, upon viewing this movie, is that there was so much wasted in The Last Jedi.  It seems so much time was spent on Ach-to, the space chase and Canto Bight that could've been better used advancing the overall narrative and arc.  It seems J.J. was forced to course correct far too much and, as a result, we are left with a very busy finale.\n\nWith all that, I loved the movie and will see it multiple times I'm sure.  There are many great moments in the film that will shock, surprise and tug at the heartstrings.  For this long time fan since the age of four, that's all I could ask for.","displayName":"Brian T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/709410911/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T05:35:37.564Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:54:50.192Z","user":{"userId":"921505745","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian T","accountLink":"/user/id/921505745"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":" The action is okay but this is some of the worst storytelling in film history","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T05:30:02.561Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T17:34:28.742Z","user":{"userId":"260342985","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260342985"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Tied with ESB for best Star Wars film ever!!!!","displayName":"Alec E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T05:28:39.457Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T16:14:11.273Z","user":{"userId":"CD961DE5-8C75-4124-AE9A-C5F6C58661B2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Alec E","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Few plot holes but overall really enjoyable!
