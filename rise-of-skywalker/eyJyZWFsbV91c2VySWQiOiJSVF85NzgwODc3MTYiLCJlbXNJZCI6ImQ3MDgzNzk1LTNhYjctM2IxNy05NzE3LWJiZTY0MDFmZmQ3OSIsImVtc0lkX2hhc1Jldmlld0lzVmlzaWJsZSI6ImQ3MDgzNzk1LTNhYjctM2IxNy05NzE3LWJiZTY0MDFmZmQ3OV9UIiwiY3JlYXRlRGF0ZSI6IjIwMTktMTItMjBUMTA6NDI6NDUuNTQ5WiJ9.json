Without going into spoilers,  the first half of the movie felt as if it was comprised of video game cut scenes from the writing, cinematography, and pacing while the last half of the movie felt like it was a rushed, poorly thought out (if at all), bad fan made movie.

There are some serious issues: the sidelining of Rose, the introduction of too many new characters, some glaring moments of pure fan service, and most of all: it's far too fast and rushed and probably needed two movies to tell this one story. I'm left with no resolution, no real questions answered, and character arcs half finished. It feels rushed and messy. That being said, Daisy Ridley's performance is outstanding.","displayName":"Cody H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T09:52:46.509Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T10:05:49.320Z","user":{"userId":"977731273","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cody H","accountLink":"/user/id/977731273"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie is more focused on shoving in new things instead of building on what was presented in the previous movies, and as a result we get a messily paced, emotionless laundry list of things happening.
