I just felt that is was very lazy and unoriginal.  The movie itself was pretty visually stunning.  I like the homage to past movies and the overdue accolades for Chewbaca.  As far as Kylo Ren/Ben Solo story line, I felt myself not caring if he found redemption only that he had some benefit to Rey.  Just more Darth Emo.","displayName":"TommyA","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T16:07:45.623Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T16:07:45.623Z","user":{"userId":"3bb7f4ea-14c2-4e27-8e85-759dc36c1570","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"TommyA","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was immersive, I found myself really caring about all the characters and the journeys they were on, this movie was full of pleasant surprises.

I think this is such a fitting end to this franchise. There are visually stunning moments, story can be a bit hokey, but come on you came for light sabers and blaster fire. It gives you all of that and more. Go see it and enjoy the fan treatment.","displayName":"Damen H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T16:07:41.078Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T16:07:41.078Z","user":{"userId":"726B1B0F-5477-431C-B8C7-D72515E82E24","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Damen H","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is a very good movie.
