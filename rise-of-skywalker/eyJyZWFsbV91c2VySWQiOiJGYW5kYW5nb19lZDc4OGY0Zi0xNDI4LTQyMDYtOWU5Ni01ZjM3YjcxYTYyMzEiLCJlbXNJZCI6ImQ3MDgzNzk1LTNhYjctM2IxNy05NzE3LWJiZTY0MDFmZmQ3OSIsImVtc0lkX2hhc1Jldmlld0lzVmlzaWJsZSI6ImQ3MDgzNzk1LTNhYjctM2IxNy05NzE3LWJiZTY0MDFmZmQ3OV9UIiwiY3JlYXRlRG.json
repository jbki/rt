It is certainly not the best Star Wars ever and the trilogy as a whole could have been so much better. However, given the extremlely difficult circumstances (all the issues caused by The Last Jedi, the death of Carrie Fisher, the lack of creative plot for the trilogy as a whole, the complete failure of Lucasfilm/the story group to keep the basic logic of the Star Wars universe consistent), JJ Abrams did an amazing job bringing this trilogy to an end. The plot convenience is next level though, you have to buy it without questions. However, if you can do that the movie feels really great and gives the Sequel-trilogy a worthy and positive ending, which makes you look forward to the future of Star Wars again!","displayName":"B.
