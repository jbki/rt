But this movie was amazing. I left wanting to see it again right away. Let's call a spade a spade, a lot of people like to hate on Star Wars movies because they expect an Empire Strikes back feeling again. But looking back on this past year, this movie was the second best I've seen for the same price as more than a dozen others. Rather than wanting more story than they currently have, a lot of fans want to have their story the way they want it. Solid job Disney! After reading the reviews of some critics it may feel like people should jump on the hate wagon, but this movie was amazing!","displayName":"Matthew L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:46:39.514Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:47:31.447Z","user":{"userId":"978466275","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew L","accountLink":"/user/id/978466275"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Overall it was a nice movie, and a million times better than the Last Jedi.","displayName":"Thais I","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001617415675/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:46:24.049Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:47:42.077Z","user":{"userId":"906064179","realm":"RT","displayName":"Thais I","accountLink":"/user/id/906064179"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Lame remake of the old, wait till it's on digital stream.","displayName":"EDGAR G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:46:06.862Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:46:06.862Z","user":{"userId":"F657C0F0-F427-4E5F-91F5-105AA4DB8CE9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"EDGAR G","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie was great , it was fast non stop action .

The most ridiculous plot and character development, lacking any adherence or cohesion with the star wars universe in general and even with its own trilogy. Is was certainly not the only one thinking that as everyone in the cinema started laughing in the \"dramatic\" climax moment. It plays super safe to save what was left after the disaster of TLJ and fails even at that.","displayName":"Jacopo G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10221021074505560/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:45:05.187Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:45:09.806Z","user":{"userId":"978466277","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jacopo G","accountLink":"/user/id/978466277"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Disney has destroyed one of the best film franchises that has ever existed.
