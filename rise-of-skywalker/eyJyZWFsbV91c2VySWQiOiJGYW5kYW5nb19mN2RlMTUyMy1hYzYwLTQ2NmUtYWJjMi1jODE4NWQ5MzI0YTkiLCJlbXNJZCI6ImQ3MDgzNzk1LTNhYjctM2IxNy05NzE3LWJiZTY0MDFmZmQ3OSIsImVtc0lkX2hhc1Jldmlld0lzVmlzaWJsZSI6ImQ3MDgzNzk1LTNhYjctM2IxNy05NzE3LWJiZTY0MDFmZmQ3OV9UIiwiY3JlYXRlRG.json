Easily as good as the original trilogy. After seeing the reviews I went into the theater ready to be disappointed, but it was fantastic! I have NO IDEA why anyone doesn’t like it. It is exactly everything I love about Star Wars movies from the action, humor, drama standpoint as well as the feeling that permeates the movie. J.J. Abrams has delivered on every level, and I left the theater overjoyed with the accomplishment.
