They could film the whole movie just with \"holly Jesus Ray\" since she is all-powerful. The movie is frantic, always chasing a thing that will lead to the next thing, with a ridiculous plot and forgettable generic characters. Also, lightsaber sword fights are really badly choreographed, just boring slashing with absolutely no finesse. This is a Star Wars rip off and in no way looks like a genuine thing.","displayName":"Robert P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T07:15:26.321Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T07:15:42.079Z","user":{"userId":"978239547","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert P","accountLink":"/user/id/978239547"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"This was fine.
