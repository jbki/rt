Start felt a little more like a montage but it improved. They were obviously trying to fix the plot from the last movie. Critics will hate on it because it has to undo the last film which they defend heavily and super starwars fans will because it had to mangle the lore and had some plot holes (its effectively two movies in one) but the general public will like it","displayName":"Pdre E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/214442409586704/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:57:00.321Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:58:17.162Z","user":{"userId":"978453117","realm":"RT","displayName":"Pdre E","accountLink":"/user/id/978453117"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie is pure trash!

Best movie since empire strikes back. This is the disconnect between critics and fans. Most of us thought the last jedi was bad at best. The complaint about this movie seems to be the nostalgia. That's the coolest part of this movie. In my opinion this movie righted the wrong path that the last jedi went down and in a way actually made that movie better in the process.","displayName":"Ray P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/216710205773304/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:56:20.793Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:56:29.128Z","user":{"userId":"977292884","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ray P","accountLink":"/user/id/977292884"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
