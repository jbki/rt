I loved this film. It cohesively ties together all three of the new trilogy, and links it to the originals in a great way. The story is cyclical in nature, just like the old trilogy was. Great acting, fast paced, edge of your seat film making. It was thrilling to watch. I absolutely loved it.","displayName":"Jay Sizemore","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T19:30:27.518Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T19:30:27.518Z","user":{"userId":"83658282-B31E-48B7-BAE6-8F7492E33EF4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jay Sizemore","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Fixes many of the issues that The Last Jedi made for the franchise.
