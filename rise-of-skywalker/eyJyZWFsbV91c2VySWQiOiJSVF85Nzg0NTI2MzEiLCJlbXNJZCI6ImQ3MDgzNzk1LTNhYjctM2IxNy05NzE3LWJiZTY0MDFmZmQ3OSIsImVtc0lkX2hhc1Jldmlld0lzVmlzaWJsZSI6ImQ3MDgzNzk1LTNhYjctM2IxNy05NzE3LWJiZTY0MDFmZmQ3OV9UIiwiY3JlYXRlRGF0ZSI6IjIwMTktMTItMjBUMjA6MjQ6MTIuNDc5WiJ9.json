JJ wraps up the Saga in the best way possible, and does so even while fixing the mistakes made in The Last Jedi. There was never a dull moment in this movie, and the visuals/ storytelling were top notch. Though, like any movie, its not perfect and there are definitely some plot holes to be discussed, but overall, an amazing film with an uncanny group of talented actors who bring this story, to an end.","displayName":"John S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:23:52.385Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:23:52.385Z","user":{"userId":"448351ea-570e-4df8-b77f-e656f31a459f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"John S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"wow what a mess, what an awful, non-sensical, frantic, disrespectful way to end this wonderful franchise which is so dear to so many of us..
