Just... no.\n\nThe movie starts with a major plot point which is hinted at nowhere in 7 and 8 and completely undoes the triumphant ending of the original Star Wars trilogy.\n\nSpecial effects--great, of course. Acting, serviceable, and nice job by Daisy Ridley as Rey.\n\nOne of the great things about Fury Road was the staging, you could tell how every battle was set and who was where doing what. This, the opposite. A muddled mess.","displayName":"Henry H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:37:59.475Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:38:07.453Z","user":{"userId":"927452302","realm":"RT","displayName":"Henry H","accountLink":"/user/id/927452302"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"I would not know where to start. There was a time where Hollywood would give us what we did not expect with great story and character development. The problem with this entire trilogy is there was nothing clever about it. With so much great content in the Star Wars Cannon available, the writers went out on their own, I am not critical of that however, they failed terribly. They gave everyone what they wanted to see. Light Saber duels (Which I love) and great visuals (Second to none), but the story was just poorly written and completely uninspired. This last film reminded me of the final episode of Game of Thrones. We walked out like, \"Really? That is it?\" My feeling here is that Disney truly does not care because their focus is on producing much more inspired content on Disney+ where you can have months/seasons of character and story development, \"Which I believe is a much better plan as Hollywood has just simply failed Star Wars Fans.\"","displayName":"Donald S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:37:54.915Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:37:54.915Z","user":{"userId":"278fa9bc-01e5-435d-a98f-2e1d3fc74768","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Donald S","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great ending.
