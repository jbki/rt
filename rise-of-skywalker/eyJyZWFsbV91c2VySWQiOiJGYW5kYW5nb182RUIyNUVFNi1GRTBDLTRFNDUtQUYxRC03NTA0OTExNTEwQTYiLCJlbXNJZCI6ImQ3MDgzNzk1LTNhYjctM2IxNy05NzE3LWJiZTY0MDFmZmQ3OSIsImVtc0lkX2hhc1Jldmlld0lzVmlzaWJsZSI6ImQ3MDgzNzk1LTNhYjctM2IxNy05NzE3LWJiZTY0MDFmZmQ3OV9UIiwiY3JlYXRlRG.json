However, the plot seemed rushed. Palpatine was a very unexpected return and the film did not show evidence on how he survived. Character development on Rey's character was finally shown. Finn's character seemed to be taking a backseat in this film. Overall, good fan service in this film, but I was not satisfied with the weak plot.","displayName":"Paul L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T22:46:22.400Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T22:46:38.912Z","user":{"userId":"975180543","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paul L","accountLink":"/user/id/975180543"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was and enjoyable conclusion to the new trilogy.
