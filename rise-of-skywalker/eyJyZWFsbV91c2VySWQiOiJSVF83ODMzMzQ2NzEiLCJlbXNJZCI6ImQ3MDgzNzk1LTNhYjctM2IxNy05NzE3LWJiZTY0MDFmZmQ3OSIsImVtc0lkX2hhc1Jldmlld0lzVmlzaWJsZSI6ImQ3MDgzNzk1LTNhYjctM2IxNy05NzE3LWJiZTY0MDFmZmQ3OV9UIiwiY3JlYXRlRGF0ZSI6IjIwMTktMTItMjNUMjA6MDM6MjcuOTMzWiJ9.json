They added in too many characters. Special effects were ok, but the story line needed a lot of help. Was very disappointed. Star wars should have ended at return of the Jedi, they way it was intended to. With bringing people and places back, it leaves it open for more movies.\nIf looking to see this movie, wait for it to come out on DVD.
