I was pleasantly surprised, the movie had a good pace, some gorgeous scenes, and felt more like a Star Wars movie to me than the last film and didn't borrow the plot like 7. Full of moments that keep you on the edge of your seat and fun hidden treats for fans. My favorite of the new trilogy by a long shot.","displayName":"Devin E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000207888732/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:30.332Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:38.315Z","user":{"userId":"949882198","realm":"RT","displayName":"Devin E","accountLink":"/user/id/949882198"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The end of a saga. Maybe the most important film saga in cinema history. Lots of fan service. Almost entirely ignores TLJ, which I'm sure will be disappointing to some. Really wish JJ Abrams had directed all 3 films, but such is life. It definitely had the feel and spirit of a Star Wars film. I will absolutely be seeing it again.","displayName":"Chris W.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:29.850Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:29.850Z","user":{"userId":"C5328967-C628-4FEC-9624-5B895635B8A8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chris W.","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A great action packed ending to the Skywalker Saga.","displayName":"Sheev P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:26.869Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:28.916Z","user":{"userId":"978445797","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sheev P","accountLink":"/user/id/978445797"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I liked it.

Pair this with some fantastic acting, directing, and cinematography, as well as the exemplary ability to bring a smooth end to the whole saga, including the whole saga and without painful references, one finds a film that is outright fantastic for a fan, and an exceedingly good movie for a newcomer. So if you were to follow what I say, I'd recommend you watch the movie, and follow the love of the fans and viewers, not the ratings of critics that are based not in opinion, but in the usual regard to something new in Star Wars, regardless of this being a clear exception to Disney's usual lack of artistic creativity, and think about giving a rating like mine, to show that a fan appreciates a legitimate good film and that we want more. But that's just my opinion, it's art, ergo subjective. So please keep this in mind when talking about the movie, differentiate opinion and fact, whether you agree or disagree with me, because I want to love the  community of Star Wars that I'm a part of. If you got this far, thanks for reading, I appreciate it.\n\n-Sincerely, a random person","displayName":"Max  S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:23.905Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:23.905Z","user":{"userId":"978445450","realm":"RT","displayName":"Max  S","accountLink":"/user/id/978445450"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Forget the critics.
