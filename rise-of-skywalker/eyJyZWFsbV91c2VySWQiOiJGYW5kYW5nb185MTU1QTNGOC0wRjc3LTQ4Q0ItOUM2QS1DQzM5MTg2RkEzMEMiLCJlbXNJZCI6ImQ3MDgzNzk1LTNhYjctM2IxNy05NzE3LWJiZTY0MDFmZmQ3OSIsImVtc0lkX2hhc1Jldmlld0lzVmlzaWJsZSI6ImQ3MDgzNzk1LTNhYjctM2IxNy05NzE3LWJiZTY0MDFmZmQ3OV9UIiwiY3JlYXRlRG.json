They didn't have much to work with given the abortion that was TLJ.  But bringing Palpatine back, not explaining it at all?  Force ghost luck can wield a Lightsaber, and Yoda can fire lightning.  Why don't they just go kill Palpatine?  Oh look, there is inexplicably an entire fleet of Star Destroyers with death star lasers BIGGER BETTER FASTER MORE@!!!! !

It even makes it into something resembling a half decent trilogy overall. Nearly. None of these extra films were needed at all, but ultimately we saw a few new nice planets, the occasional decent new character (though not many), and lots more Miklennium Falcon and Chewie, which can only be a good thing. I am someone who listens to critics and use them  as a guide to see a movie or not, but feel the polar opposite to what they do regarding this new trilogy. Force Awakens was no more than ok, Last Jedi was godawful, and this is actually pretty good! Maybe by now my standards have been lowered but I spent the first half thinking ‘so when does this get bad? Because right now it's a lot of fun and I'm enjoying it and it isn't moving too fast at all and it isn't all exposition and even the newer characters are holding my attention this time around, so what's the issue exactly?'. Turns out I preferred the first half to the second (another opposite to the critics), but man, is this film getting unfair (as in untrue) criticism. Not liking it is fine, but at least have reasons that are right! Unimaginative?! Why does Star Wars have to be some supreme level of imagination? When did it have to shock you every 5 minutes? It's a Star Wars film.....did he originals have that much going for them in these senses? They are my favourite films of all time, but Empire is the best one yet all we really get are battle, Luke trains while the others try to escape, they get caught and luck catches up with them and has a fight with who we learn is his dad, loses, the end. Fantastic stuff, but although the locations are fun, it's not THAT imaginative, is it? Is returnif the Jedi imaginative?! They need to find the emporer to kill him once and for all.....and we get some revelations along the way.....that's fine by me! I nitpicked a lot in Last Jedi but that was about the overall story, where it went, and the choices of the characters.....and the writer for what he thought would make a fun time. Nitpicking things like ‘how did Kyko get off the Death Star runs when Rey took his ship?' is NOT integral to he story and if you use  Our imagination then I'm sure you can fill in the blanks, so just switch off, enjoy the ride, smile at the call backs and try to have a good time, will you, people! After Last Jedi, watching a sausage roll for 2 hours would have been an improvement, so be glad that there is a sense of closure and a half decent film before you!","displayName":"James A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10152409724988112/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:42:13.877Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:42:19.131Z","user":{"userId":"976923496","realm":"RT","displayName":"James A","accountLink":"/user/id/976923496"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent.
