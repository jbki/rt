JJ has been tasked with the seemingly impossible - creating a satisfying end to a 9 film saga, picking up from an 8th part which left nothing to work on beyond a Monty Python routine for villains and heroes that no one really cared for. Added to that you've got an environment of YouTubers who are also slating this film having now found careers and followers in the \"I hate Star Wars\" brigade who are desperately trying to maintain their clickbait followers that were rightfully angry with the Last Jedi. \nSo with that context what has JJ achieved? An absolute monster smash. This film is epic. It made me care again for characters that were set up in the Force Awakens, it redeemed the bad treatment of heroes past such as Luke and it reminded me of why I love Star Wars. There are so many moments where I was close to tears as JJ pulled on the nostalgia, moments where I jumped out of my seat in excitement and moments when I was just in awe at the visual spectacle. \nSure this film has flaws but they are flaws caused by the necessary retconning of the mess that was made before by Rian Johnson. When a film is being criticised that it has too much fan service - that basically means it provides an all action Star Wars rollercoaster ride reminiscent of the original trilogy and goes without the unnecessary Kathleen Kennedy driven gender, race politics.\nI've seen this film twice and am booking for the third viewing in a few more days. So sad it's over but what a way to end it. If you really love Star Wars, forget the Last Jedi, forget the flaws caused by the necessary retconning and you will love this film. JJ I salute you sir, if only you were given the reins to part 8 also.","displayName":"Awwfrack C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/123853845615924/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:36:38.016Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:36:43.840Z","user":{"userId":"978226361","realm":"RT","displayName":"Awwfrack C","accountLink":"/user/id/978226361"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"difficult comeback after Rian Johnson's stinker, but a pretty good wrap-up all things considered.","displayName":"John T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:36:29.164Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:36:29.164Z","user":{"userId":"55EC85F4-4F94-4742-95AB-D76EC198FFDC","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"John T","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"}]}
