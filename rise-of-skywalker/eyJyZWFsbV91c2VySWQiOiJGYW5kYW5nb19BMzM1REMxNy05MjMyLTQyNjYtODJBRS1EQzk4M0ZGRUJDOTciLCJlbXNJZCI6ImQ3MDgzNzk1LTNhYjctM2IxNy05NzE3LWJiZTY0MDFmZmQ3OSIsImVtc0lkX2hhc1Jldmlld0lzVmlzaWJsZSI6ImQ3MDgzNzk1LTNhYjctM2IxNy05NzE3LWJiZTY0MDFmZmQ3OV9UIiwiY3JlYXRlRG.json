The narrative is bloated and rushed, but the script managed to be mired by incredibly lazy writing at the same time. The only redeeming quality is all the metaphorical middle fingers this film extends to its miserable predecessor: TLJ. Unfortunately this film is far from able to claim the high ground over TLJ in terms of story quality or respect for the established Star Wars lore, which was unfathomable to me before seeing TROS. Plain to see that this was the result of Lucasfilm having no coherent vision for the overarching story from the very beginning of the sequel trilogy. This ending cements my feeling that none of the sequel films belong as a continuation of episodes 1-6. These new films are just stapled on to the end of ROTJ for the cash grab; there was no apparent sense of obligation on the part of Lucasfilm to provide Star Wars fans with so much as a competent story, let alone an interesting one. Way to bungle the incredible potential of this universe. Not only did you screw up your own stories at nearly every turn, you attempted to retroactively undo all the achievements of our beloved heroes in the OT... especially with the revival of Palpatine in this film, which was just bafflingly stupid. Fortunately I can choose to ignore this hot mess of a trilogy and revert back to a time where the saga ended (beautifully) on Endor. I will never patronize any new Star Wars content ever again.","displayName":"Bernard C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-30T20:36:36.589Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T20:36:49.138Z","user":{"userId":"977289335","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bernard C","accountLink":"/user/id/977289335"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Not much story.
