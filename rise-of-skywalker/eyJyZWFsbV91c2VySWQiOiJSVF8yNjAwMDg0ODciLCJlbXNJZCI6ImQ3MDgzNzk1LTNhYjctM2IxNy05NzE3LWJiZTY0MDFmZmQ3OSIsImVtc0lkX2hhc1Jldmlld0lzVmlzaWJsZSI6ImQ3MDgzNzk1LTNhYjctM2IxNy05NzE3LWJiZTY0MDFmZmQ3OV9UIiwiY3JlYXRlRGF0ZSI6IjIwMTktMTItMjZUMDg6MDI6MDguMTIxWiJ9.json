Bringing back favorite and popular characters and utilizing their quirks establishes a return to the more traditional tropes, making the movie far more like the \"Star Wars\" many grew up watching. Despite the finale to the Skywalker Saga being somewhat underwhelming for some fanatics, it delivers a memorable experience none the less. It is a must-see for any die-hard Star Wars fan and a good time for the average action/sci-fi movie buff.","displayName":"Parker H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T07:49:01.187Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T08:08:19.790Z","user":{"userId":"978457380","realm":"RT","displayName":"Parker H","accountLink":"/user/id/978457380"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The fans won the war with Disney.
