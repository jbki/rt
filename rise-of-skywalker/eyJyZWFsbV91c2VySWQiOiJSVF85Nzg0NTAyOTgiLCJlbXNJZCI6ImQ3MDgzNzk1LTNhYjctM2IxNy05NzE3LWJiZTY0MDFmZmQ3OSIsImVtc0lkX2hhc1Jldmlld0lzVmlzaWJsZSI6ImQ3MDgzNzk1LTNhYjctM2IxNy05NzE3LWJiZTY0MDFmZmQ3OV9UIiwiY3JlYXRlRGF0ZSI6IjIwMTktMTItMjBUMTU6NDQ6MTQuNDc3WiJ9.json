Finally, witnessed real growth and development of ancellary characters (Poe and Finn) whose journey matters to the overall narrative of the film. While some of the plot devices were.... well, obvious plot devices, they didn't feel as if they detracted from the film (nor supported it). One of my favorite of the franchise.","displayName":"Bobby M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T15:21:33.925Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:37:56.244Z","user":{"userId":"978450150","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bobby M","accountLink":"/user/id/978450150"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Perfect end to the franchise!","displayName":"Connor G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000662913516/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T15:18:24.566Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:59:32.063Z","user":{"userId":"920030298","realm":"RT","displayName":"Connor G","accountLink":"/user/id/920030298"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
