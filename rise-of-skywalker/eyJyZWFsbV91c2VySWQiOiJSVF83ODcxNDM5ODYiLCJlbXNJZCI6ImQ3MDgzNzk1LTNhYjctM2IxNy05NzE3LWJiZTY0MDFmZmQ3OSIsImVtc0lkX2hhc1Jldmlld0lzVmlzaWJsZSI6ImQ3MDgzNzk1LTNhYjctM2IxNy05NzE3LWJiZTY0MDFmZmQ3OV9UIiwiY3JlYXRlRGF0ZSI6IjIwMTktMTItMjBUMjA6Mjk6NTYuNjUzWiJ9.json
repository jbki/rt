This movie along with its two predecessors fails to live up in any way to the previous standards set by Star Wars films with Lucas at the helm. Little if any sense can be made of the obvious unorganized direction Disney has taken Lucasâ€™ beloved franchise. It seems that our last hope for a satisfactory conclusion to the Skywalker narrative has been lost.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:29:27.600Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:29:27.600Z","user":{"userId":"846403875","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/846403875"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I think it was a good movie that made the best of the story that was given from the Last Jedi.","displayName":"Ali K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000674409411/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:29:16.250Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:29:28.255Z","user":{"userId":"978127076","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ali K","accountLink":"/user/id/978127076"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"JJ Abrams had quite a task in cleaning up the mess that Rian Johnson made of the Star Wars Cinematic Universe. However, Abrams took what was given to him (7 good films and a hot pile of garbage) and delivered a more than satisfying finish to the Skywalker Saga. This actually felt like a Star Wars film instead of a Star Wars branded piece of propaganda. From the action, to the story telling, to the plot twists (don't worry, no spoilers), this was a lovely and brilliant conclusion. The only two conclusion movies I would rank higher than Episode IX are Avengers: End Game and Return of the King. I was not let down by the movie and I am well pleased with how this story was wrapped up.","displayName":"Aaron M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/500099966/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:29:13.934Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:34:25.616Z","user":{"userId":"783843797","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aaron M","accountLink":"/user/id/783843797"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Horribly written (starting literally at the opening crawl) and carelessly conceived. It counteracts all that was done in its predecessor in order to please the fans, without realizing it's producing a lower quality story as a result. The fan service was beyond the point of condescending pandering. It treats the characters as pawns to achieve a fanboy's checklist of required occurrences in the story. At the end of the day, this really felt like a very bad fan fiction with too large of a budget. I wanted to cry on the way home from the theater while contemplating the fact that this will forever be the final chapter in the legacy the Star Wars Saga, an affront to good cinema and Star Wars alike.","displayName":"Xander P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2625166614269229/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:29:03.325Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:29:11.850Z","user":{"userId":"978452879","realm":"RT","displayName":"Xander P","accountLink":"/user/id/978452879"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Just got home from watching the last film of the Skywalker Saga.
