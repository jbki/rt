Instead it leaves you exhausted with constant action and jumpcuts, while trying to introduce a whole new set of bland characters and forgetting about the bland characters they already have. Many questionable editing and plot choices, cleverly masked by throwing an explosion in your face every 5 seconds.

The main problems I see are the insane power jumps and random force powers created for this movie to move along the story they created. The force becomes a joke in this movie. Sidious using his lightning on hundreds or thousands of ships at one time is something straight out of a video game. It makes every other Jedi and Sith in Star Wars seem like nothing. And Rey using a second lightsaber to suddenly be better at reflecting the lightning felt like something a child would come up with. \n\nThis movie was an overreaction to the hate some people had for TLJ. Which will be thought of as the best movie in this trilogy in a few years.","displayName":"Shane C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/501023318/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:16:27.396Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:16:38.959Z","user":{"userId":"907875245","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shane C","accountLink":"/user/id/907875245"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The movie moved really well and was never boring, which is more I can say for its predecessor.
