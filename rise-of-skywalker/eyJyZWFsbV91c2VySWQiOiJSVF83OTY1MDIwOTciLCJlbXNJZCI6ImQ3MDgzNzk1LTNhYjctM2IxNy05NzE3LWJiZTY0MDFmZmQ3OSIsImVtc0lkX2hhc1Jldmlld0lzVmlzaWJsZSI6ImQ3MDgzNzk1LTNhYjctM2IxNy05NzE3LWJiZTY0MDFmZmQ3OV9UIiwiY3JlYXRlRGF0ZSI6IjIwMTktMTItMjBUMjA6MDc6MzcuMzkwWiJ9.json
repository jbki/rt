I did not think that The Last Jedi was a perfect movie, but I felt that it explored the force and the perspectives of characters in unique ways. This movie ignores much of what Rian Johnson presented in favor of some of the weakest fan service I have seen in the Star Wars franchise so far. This movie takes takes aspects from both the original and prequel trilogy and combines them to create a new ending that is completely dissatisfying. What a shame. Good luck with the next trilogy.","displayName":"Erik M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:07:00.681Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:22:56.960Z","user":{"userId":"977971386","realm":"RT","displayName":"Erik M","accountLink":"/user/id/977971386"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"J J Abrahms has provided us with a terrific end of the Skywalker Saga.  My only gripe with it is it is way, way too fast paced, with little time for character development...we barely meet new characters (or old) before we're dragged off to the next scene and we are left asking \"What just happened?\".  Overall, however, I found this film to be a satisfying end, and that comes from a 11 year old boy who in 1977 stood in line to see the first Star Wars movie ever.
