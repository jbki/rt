So, the lower the critics rating, the more likely I go!!\nRise of Skywalker was a fun movie.   While it certainly had some plot holes, the movie was fun and engaging enough to easily overlook them.  Great Special Effects, lots of fun and exciting scenes.   Movie focused on just a few characters, so they had time for real character development and to get to know them.\nStill don't quite understand the end (SPOILERS) and why Rey can kill **bad guy** and not be sucked into the evil as **bad guy** said she would if she killed him.  BUT, that ok..... it was fun ride to get to that part.\nGreat fun movie for the whole family, with lots of fun scenes to laugh about on the drive home .... so a great family night out.","displayName":"Steven C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T19:13:30.983Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T19:13:45.381Z","user":{"userId":"977938309","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steven C","accountLink":"/user/id/977938309"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a great movie!
