But instead of shit hitting the fan it's closer to a normal expected shitting the bed.\n\nPros:\n\nFun fights, lightsabers are shiny. Supporting cast was decent, and they had to improve on episode 8.\n\nShit the bed moments:\n\nPalpatine came from nowhere, effectively invalidating episode 6. No reasons given. And George Lucas still sticks to Anakin being the chosen one bringing balance to the force by killing Palpatine (see interviews). Not creative enough to come up with their own big bad boss? Couldn't they just not have killed Snoke?\n\nRay can effectively do anything. She's a mechanic, expert marksman, master swordsman (cept against the little robot ball at the start), fully force sensitive and an overpowered healer. If only people knew how to use the force to instantly repair people previously. We might still have had Qui-Gonn.\n\nPeople can suddenly transport objects and themselves across distances because the plot needed it. FML\n\nDid they force couple Ray and Ben? How did that become a sudden thing? Maybe the force healing gets the libido going.\n\nGhosts can now catch lightsabers and move shit around. Ok then.\n\nLeia had her own lightsaber and was able to beat Luke in a flashback - because they needed an extra lightsaber.\n\nMade me question the point of episodes 2-6.\n\nThese are first impressions. I see one weird argument that one should watch the movies as if you're a 12 year old. That's a weak argument. Movies can be both readily accessible, fun AND still make sense to adults. Episodes 4 - 6 (and even 2 & 3 comparatively ) are rewatchable and make logical sense. Statements to the effect that \"if you're a child it's a good movie\" - do not mean it's a good movie!\n\nMost of the above could have been avoided with having one or two star wars fans on the writing team.","displayName":"GT W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:48:21.036Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:50:51.871Z","user":{"userId":"978459926","realm":"RT","displayName":"GT W","accountLink":"/user/id/978459926"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It's really sad to see all the Star Wars hate surrounding the new trilogy.  I guess Star Wars is that polarizing of a franchise, becoming as big as it has, to cause all of the dissatisfaction.  In no way do I think every movie does everything right, nor have they done everything wrong.  Even the original trilogy has it's issues.  With that said, I think Rise of Skywalker was a great movie, from all the action sequences, fan service, and overall story.  There is a ton of throwback in here along with new ideas and concepts, in a great enough mix to surpass the shortcomings of The Last Jedi.  It's a fun and emotional ride, just as Star Wars always makes me feel with each film.","displayName":"Anthony L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:48:14.261Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:48:14.261Z","user":{"userId":"978374560","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anthony L","accountLink":"/user/id/978374560"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Thank you JJ for finishing it off right!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:47:31.786Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:47:31.786Z","user":{"userId":"861951362","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/861951362"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My entire family loved this movie from start to finish.
