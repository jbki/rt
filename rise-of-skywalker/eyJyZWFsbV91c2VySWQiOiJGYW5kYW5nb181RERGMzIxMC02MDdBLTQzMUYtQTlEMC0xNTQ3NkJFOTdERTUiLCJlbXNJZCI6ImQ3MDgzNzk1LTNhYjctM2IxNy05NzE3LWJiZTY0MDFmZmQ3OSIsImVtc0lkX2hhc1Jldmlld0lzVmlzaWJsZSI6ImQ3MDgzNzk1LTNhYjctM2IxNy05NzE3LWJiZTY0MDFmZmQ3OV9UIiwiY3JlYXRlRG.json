It was non stop action from the moment the opening screen crawl ended until the end credits. JJ Abrams did a spectacular job trying to right the ship. The only issue I had was how they handled the return of Palpatine. His return/reveal should have been more dramatic. But for some reason itâ€™s included in the opening crawl. Other than that, TROS was easily the best of new trilogy, and even better than Dom of the prequels. Thank you JJ!

Palpatine is back and he made Snoke?? This single handedly makes Anakin's  role as the chosen one  pointless, also  there is now literally no reason for Snoke' s existence. \n2. Deus ex machina a.k.a the new concept of force ghost. So, as in TLJ, force ghosts can manipulate real objects.Remember when in the ROTJ\nObi wan said to Luke he can't interfere with his battle with the Emperor it was because he couldn' t and not that he didn't want it. So the real question is now why don't Luke and Yoda go kill Palpatine he obviously can't kill them.\n3. Force resurrection. So, i am ok with the concept of force healing, but bringing someone back from the dead is too much.\nSW ep10 The Rise of the Necromancer\n4. Lightspeed skipping and spaceship death stars. So lets retcon the Holdo maneuvar, but will add new ridiculous concepts. \n5.Kylo Ren's helmet and Knights of Ren. The most useless things in the galaxy.","displayName":"Aaron L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:57:56.125Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:58:08.508Z","user":{"userId":"978452597","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aaron L","accountLink":"/user/id/978452597"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love it.

Lots of exposition. Some great twists but they didn't feel earned to me, in part because we didn't have a lot of down time to remember the bonds between the characters and to establish an emotional connection to the new ones.

Abrams had a huge mountain to overcome in The Rise Of Skywalker, but he absolutely did so with dignity & style.  While there are certainly a few rushed bits in the first act (hell, he had to cram an entire movie's worth of character development into a couple scenes since the main trio had never fully interacted before), the end result is a film that is a visual spectacle with a great story the fans deserved.  Would it have been great if many of these seeds were planted during the boring space-chase of TLJ?  Oh hell yeah, but nevertheless I'm ecstatic that we got here in the end!  Definitely go see this film!","displayName":"Cameron J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10221984615668672/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:57:25.624Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:00:15.895Z","user":{"userId":"978453118","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cameron J","accountLink":"/user/id/978453118"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great job JJ.
