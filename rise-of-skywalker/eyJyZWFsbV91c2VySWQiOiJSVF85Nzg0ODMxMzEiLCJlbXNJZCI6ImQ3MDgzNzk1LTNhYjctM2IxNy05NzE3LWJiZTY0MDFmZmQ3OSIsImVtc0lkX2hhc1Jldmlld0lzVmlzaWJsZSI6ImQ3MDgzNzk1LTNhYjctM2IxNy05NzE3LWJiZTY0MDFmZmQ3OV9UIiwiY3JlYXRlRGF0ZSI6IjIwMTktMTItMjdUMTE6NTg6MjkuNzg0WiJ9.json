For families it's fine it has some cool scenes and the whole good beats evil will make the kids smile but even then I would argue to just watch something else as it can get boring at some points. If your an adult who's 21 or older a couple beers will make this really entertaing that's how would recommend you see this movie.","displayName":"Javier G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1330177677162363/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T11:55:54.726Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T11:55:57.180Z","user":{"userId":"978482998","realm":"RT","displayName":"Javier G","accountLink":"/user/id/978482998"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Not bad, better than some of the previous episodes","displayName":"Rudy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T11:55:06.564Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T11:55:06.564Z","user":{"userId":"0be5d8e0-e60b-44af-85ed-e07a83193764","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rudy","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"As a fan of the story from day-one, this was an excellent wrap up.
