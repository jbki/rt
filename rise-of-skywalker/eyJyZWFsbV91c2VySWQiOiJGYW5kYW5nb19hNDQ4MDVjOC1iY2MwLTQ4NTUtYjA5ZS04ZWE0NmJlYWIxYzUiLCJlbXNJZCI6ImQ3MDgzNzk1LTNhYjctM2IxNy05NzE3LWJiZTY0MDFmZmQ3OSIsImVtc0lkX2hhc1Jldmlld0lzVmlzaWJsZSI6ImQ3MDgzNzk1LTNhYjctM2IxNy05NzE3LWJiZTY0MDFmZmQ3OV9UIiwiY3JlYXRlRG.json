Great acting by the cast, good to see several old faces return, and a very fitting ending to the whole story itself. If you're a casual fan of the series like I am, you'll definitely enjoy it .. just be prepared for a few tear-jerker moments throughout, but it is also mixed with quite a few comedic moments ..","displayName":"Drew K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/598415193/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T06:04:57.685Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T06:05:10.943Z","user":{"userId":"819170878","realm":"RT","displayName":"Drew K","accountLink":"/user/id/819170878"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a pretty good ending to the movie.
