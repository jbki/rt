The movie doesn't exactly satisfyingly wrap up the Skywalker Saga, but it absolutely could have been worse. This sequel trilogy feels like it goes back on what the film before it established.  All in all, its a Star Wars film, so it is basically predisposed to being iconic, so there isn't much bad that I can say about it.","displayName":"Nate Q","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T09:36:41.298Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T09:36:44.266Z","user":{"userId":"978162100","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nate Q","accountLink":"/user/id/978162100"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"19h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Entertaining yet underwhelming.","displayName":"Matthew G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T09:30:56.045Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T09:30:58.590Z","user":{"userId":"978500340","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew G","accountLink":"/user/id/978500340"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"19h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Was good, tho not of the caliber of the original 3.","displayName":"Bill S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T09:23:19.131Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T09:23:19.131Z","user":{"userId":"360BE151-4F22-47B2-A141-42BD8F5A0012","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bill S","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"19h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Destroyed everything that was great about The Last Jedi by taking taking a large steaming poop on it.
