Great special effects and sound that helps define a Star Wars movie, but depth of story is severely lacking. Typical of a lot of writers this day and age, development of characters and plot lines are mostly non-existent. Need a solution for a predicament and one appears out of thin air, no need to work in precursors into the storylines. Reminds me of the ending of Lost - all the fascinating and mysterious plot and storylines just trampled in the ending. You could definitely made a lot of choices to appease the internet trolls from The Last Jedi. \nNot to say the movie was a total bust- my preteen boys thoroughly enjoyed it and rank it as one of the better in the Skywalker series.","displayName":"Michael K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10162792030820176/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-31T22:35:43.554Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T22:42:49.701Z","user":{"userId":"978495051","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael K","accountLink":"/user/id/978495051"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I've been a Star Wars fan since New Hope when I was 9. This was everything that I wanted to tie everything together at the end. (Also, I'm not one of those people with the delusion that I'm somehow in charge of how the story plays out since I'm not the writer/director. I just enjoy the ride.) This hit all of the right points and was a nonstop fun ride. Go and enjoy and don't worry about what other people say. Make up your own mind as to whether it met your Star Wars expectations.","displayName":"William G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T22:35:34.046Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T22:35:34.046Z","user":{"userId":"428d60f3-72fb-4368-9b8a-f29d15997022","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"William G","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"}]}
