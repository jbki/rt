Its presented at a break neck pace.  This is likely to prevent you from thinking about a few of the apparent plot holes created by the narrative.  The second issue is the story is just sort of meh.  I wish we would have seen Poe, Finn and Rey work together before this.  There may have been some emotional weight.  The movie also lays the member berries hard.  Would recommend taking kids to it, but it is not a great movie.","displayName":"Joseph W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:37:23.179Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:37:23.598Z","user":{"userId":"4be65a3b-1f1e-4783-bd73-562931ae17b2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joseph W","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Choppy, Odd Character Directions, Bad Audio Track.  This movie tried way to hard to bring back themes of previous Star Wars movies, very dissapointed with the story/narrative choices.
