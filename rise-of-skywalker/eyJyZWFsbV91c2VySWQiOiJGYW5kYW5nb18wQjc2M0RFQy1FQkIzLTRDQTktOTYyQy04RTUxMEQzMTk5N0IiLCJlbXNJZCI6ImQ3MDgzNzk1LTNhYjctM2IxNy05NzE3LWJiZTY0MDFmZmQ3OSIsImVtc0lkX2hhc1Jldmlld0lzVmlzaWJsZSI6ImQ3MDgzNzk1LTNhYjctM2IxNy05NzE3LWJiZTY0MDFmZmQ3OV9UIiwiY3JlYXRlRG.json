The plot was overly convoluted trying to undo what was done in The Last Jedi. Bringing back the Emperor was probably the only option left to them but somehow still felt like out of nowhere. The performances from Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac's were all good for the scripts the are given. And Ian McDiarmind was menacing in his couple scenes. The people at the head of Star Wars needed to have this trilogy planned out better.","displayName":"Michael H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T19:54:41.134Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:54:52.060Z","user":{"userId":"977923442","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael H","accountLink":"/user/id/977923442"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love all Star wars movies !!!","displayName":"Ed A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T19:54:25.166Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:54:25.166Z","user":{"userId":"0553f9fa-e053-4f80-a0d8-9adc0fc823aa","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ed A","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Life long Star Wars fan.

The movie was just lackluster but it was bearable to watch with the only annoying character being Rey. Poe is cool and Finn got a more relevant role after being pushed hard in TFA but being dumped into the blender with Rose Tico in TFA. I advise to wait for this to be on Disney+.","displayName":"Derek F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000495945565/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T19:52:18.175Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:52:31.530Z","user":{"userId":"947021161","realm":"RT","displayName":"Derek F","accountLink":"/user/id/947021161"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie we really enjoyed it.","displayName":"jerry","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T19:49:22.780Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:49:22.780Z","user":{"userId":"E2AF15B4-9837-4C82-8599-BF3894E24E1E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"jerry","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Loved the movie great way to end the series.","displayName":"Nubnew","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T19:48:59.326Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:48:59.326Z","user":{"userId":"c251efd3-b46b-44a8-af8e-c45a99d0eb05","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Nubnew","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"See it on as big a screen as you can - the effects, as usual, are tremendous.
