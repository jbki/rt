To me it made the Last Jedi better. People are too quick to judge and just because it doesnt go the way the \"FAN\" thinks it should go (their expectations), or thats not how that should/would work. The movie ties everything together. I will be going to see this movie again. I have only one 3 second complaint towards the end but once again thats my opinion.  \nGreat job to all the Star Wars cast and Disney.","displayName":"Jesse G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:00:33.604Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:00:33.604Z","user":{"userId":"978453109","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jesse G","accountLink":"/user/id/978453109"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"It was the most insulting thing that I could ever imagine.","displayName":"Julia L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:00:28.144Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:00:28.144Z","user":{"userId":"978453176","realm":"RT","displayName":"Julia L","accountLink":"/user/id/978453176"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"In my opinion the Rise of Skywalker was a good movie and I liked it! However, its clear that its trying to do a whole lot in one movie. This makes it feels incredibly fast paced and the movie rushes through a lot of things (especially the first act) because it has to do so much to make up for the mistakes of the Last Jedi. This movie really does feel like 4 or 5 hours of movie jammed into 2 and half hours. On the positive side its a beautiful movie to watch, the visuals and score are fantastic as always. This movie really makes me wish that JJ headed episode 8. It retcons a lot that happens in episode 8 and its almost like you dont even have to watch it to understand whats going on, you could just watch 7 then go to 9. A lot of the new ideas and character/story arcs really deserved two movies to develop which wouldve made the ideas they went with more fleshed out and believable. Unfortunately its jammed into one making a lot to be desired and explained. All In all I feel like they did a solid job of making something good with what was left over from the last Jedi, could it have been better? Yes most definitely, but I still feel like it was enjoyable to watch and I liked it better than the Last Jedi. Id recommend giving it a watch.","displayName":"Michael M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:00:11.644Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:00:11.644Z","user":{"userId":"e4976da8-280c-46c7-8312-55f1b499104b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael M","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Yes, it is fan service, but this fan appreciates it.

So prior to entering the theater, I prepared myself for episode VII-2. I actually enjoyed the first two acts, for what it's worth. Sure, they were a bit silly, but it felt like a Star Wars adventure, which is what I signed up for. But when everything came to a head, and the writers had to actually make decisions about these characters, everything kind of felt hollow. I can't tell you exactly why it fell flat. I'm not a Star Wars superfan. I just wanted a decent popcorn flick.","displayName":"Todd C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1276380832/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:59:57.832Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:00:13.058Z","user":{"userId":"874243995","realm":"RT","displayName":"Todd C","accountLink":"/user/id/874243995"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"We had a fast and easy experience, and the movie was great!!!!","displayName":"Allen L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:59:53.248Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:59:53.248Z","user":{"userId":"36e0c7c6-f3f2-4a45-a749-bf0c7d630b27","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Allen L","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Was a fun and entertaining movie.
