Excellent nods to the first trilogy. A few plot holes but those that are getting hung up on this genuinely have forgotten that the Empire was taken out by a group of angry bears in Return of the Jedi. I'm glad this trilogy was made as it's taken the sour taste of the prequels away for me.","displayName":"Jonathan T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T18:29:51.800Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T18:31:18.917Z","user":{"userId":"951215360","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonathan T","accountLink":"/user/id/951215360"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It was pretty good.

Also, too much wasted time looking for something that could have been explained in the opening crawl.
