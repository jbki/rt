But in terms of storytelling, it's a mess of poor pacing, exposition, conincidences, plotholes, and power creep.

Pure spectacle in IMAX. It did a great job closing the loop on the 9 stories. Plots holes are irrelevant, it was super entertaining, and the fast pace was a  nice change from the other movie in the saga. It expanded the universe and should make a nice jumping off point for the next generation of star wars storytellers! Go see it, several times in IMAX!!!","displayName":"Scott H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157829592011240/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T21:48:28.603Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T21:48:35.624Z","user":{"userId":"978481128","realm":"RT","displayName":"Scott H","accountLink":"/user/id/978481128"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The worst Star Wars movie.","displayName":"Marco D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T21:47:56.642Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T21:47:56.642Z","user":{"userId":"978481134","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marco D","accountLink":"/user/id/978481134"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Definitely recommend in IMAX.
