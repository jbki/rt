We are given three movies that I consider to be enjoyable when consumed on their own. Ultimately, however, the sequel trilogy as a whole is: messy, disjointed and lacks any sense of direction or purpose. This is what happens when you don't have one person steering the ship. In the end, it feels as if Rian Johnson and J. J. Abrams are fighting against one another, rather than working together. \n\nAs far as The Rise of Skywalker goes, it is both entertaining and enjoyable for the most part. Where this movie falls short is it's over-reliance on nostalgia, and it's questionable interpretation of how the force works. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren once again carries the show, whilst Rey once again feels so overpowered that it becomes hard for the viewer to invest in her journey. \n\nThe start of Episode IX is very messy, almost as if it's trying to bite off more than it can chew, especially in its attempt to undo where The Last Jedi left us. However, the longer the movie goes on, the better it gets. What we're left with is an enjoyable film, but somewhat irrelevant trilogy.","displayName":"John M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:06:46.735Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:33:12.026Z","user":{"userId":"978418768","realm":"RT","displayName":"John M","accountLink":"/user/id/978418768"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What a awesome movie !
