Lots of maguffiins and serendipity. It like quick sand for the mind and as unimportant as the quicksand in the movie. Everyone is given something to do.  Better than 7 and 8, so what. Kylo is still the only arc that even curves. Nothing changes for or about the main characters. Like 7 and 8, I'll only watch it once and buy no merch.","displayName":"Alfred R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001370556700/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T00:10:30.810Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T00:12:08.147Z","user":{"userId":"910630108","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alfred R","accountLink":"/user/id/910630108"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"One of the most disappointing movies.
