Star Wars is not Shakespeare. Its a modern take and amalgam of Flash Gordon, old Westerns, old war movies, and the like. Not deep, just fun. (With the exception of Ep 1,2,3, of course. Those were just plain bad) Rise of Skywalker, based on the above, is an action-packed, epic experience for the senses, with a 42 year-old familiarity. A fitting conclusion for the Skywalker saga. \nCritics hate it. Fans love it. The box office is definitely loving it. Lighten up all you Francis-es and just enjoy it for what it is. Youll have a great time - maybe.","displayName":"Shin","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T15:46:09.068Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T15:46:09.068Z","user":{"userId":"af72c5b6-481a-4711-b937-f5186d634f56","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Shin","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The Rise of Skywalker is a fitting end not just to the current trilogy but also to the Skywalker Saga.

Ill compare this to the Avengers franchise. \n\nWhen I watched the Avengers: Infinity War, I had never seen any of the characters individual movies let alone the other Avengers movies that came before this one. But I walked out of the theater wanting to watch all of the other movies.  Which I can say I thoroughly enjoyed. I knew I wanted to get caught up before End Game came out. \n\nThe Rise of Skywalker did nothing for me. This movie is for fans. Ones that know the ins and outs of the franchises storyline. I dont know whether this was the intention or if Disney is just milking this franchise dry. I had no desire to watch the others before it. The scenes that were supposed to be epic were just lost on me.","displayName":"Eli","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T15:40:22.532Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T15:40:22.532Z","user":{"userId":"a449a64a-b4d1-4b40-b5e7-d1abbec30d64","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Eli","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Too much crammed in to explain everything","displayName":"Brian","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T15:40:16.678Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T15:40:16.678Z","user":{"userId":"9b9342dd-188e-44e0-8464-e179249ac115","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Brian","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was great entertainment like every Star Wars I have ever seen!
