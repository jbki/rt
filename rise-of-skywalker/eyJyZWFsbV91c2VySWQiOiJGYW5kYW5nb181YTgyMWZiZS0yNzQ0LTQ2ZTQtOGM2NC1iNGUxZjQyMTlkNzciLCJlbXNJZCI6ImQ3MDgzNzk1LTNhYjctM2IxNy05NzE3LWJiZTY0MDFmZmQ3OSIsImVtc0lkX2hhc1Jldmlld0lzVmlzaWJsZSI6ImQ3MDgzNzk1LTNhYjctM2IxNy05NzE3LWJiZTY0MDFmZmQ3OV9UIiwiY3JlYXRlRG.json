The force awakens was nostalgic yes but set up a new trilogy with new characters. The last jedi dared to do something different and go in a different direction and take star wars somewhere new. This film undermines all of that. Rather than give the film a proper review, here are the questions I'm left with...\n\nHow did palpatine return?\nWhere did he get all those ships, and who is manning them?\nWhy, in 8 previous films did everyone fail to mention he had a wife or kids? You'd think that would be important.\nWhy did kylo and ren kiss?\nIf Palpatine's plan was to get to Rey all along why did he bother with Kylo? \nWhen could jedi start force healing?\nWhy had they built up the character of Rose in the last film to give her two minutes of screen time in this one?\nWhy did they introduce 3 new characters in the final film of the saga? One who literally doesn't even take her helmet off?\nWhy did they make such a big deal of C3po losing his memory to instantly get it back?\nWhy did they make a big point of Chewie dying to reveal instantly he hadn't?\nWhy was General Hux a mole?\nWhy was the entire plot like the side quest of a video game?\nHow come after getting chased by storm troopers the landed exactly on the planet where the dagger was they were looking for?\nHow did they know EXACTLY where to stand with the dagger?\nHow did Maz get Lukes saber?\n\nI understand some films have flaws but the sheer number of unanswered questions. This film has just ruined the whole trilogy for me. I never thought I'd say this but, bring back Lucas!","displayName":"Liam F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T16:14:02.945Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T16:28:39.040Z","user":{"userId":"971201381","realm":"RT","displayName":"Liam F","accountLink":"/user/id/971201381"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Excellent way to end the most recent three, but felt a bit loose in its connection to the other 6.","displayName":"Jabersquawk","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T16:13:39.791Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T16:13:39.791Z","user":{"userId":"0AA5AF56-F585-4E03-BF86-44B6FBA57FD9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jabersquawk","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"It is like they tried to cram 3 movies into 2 hours, and was there even a story?
