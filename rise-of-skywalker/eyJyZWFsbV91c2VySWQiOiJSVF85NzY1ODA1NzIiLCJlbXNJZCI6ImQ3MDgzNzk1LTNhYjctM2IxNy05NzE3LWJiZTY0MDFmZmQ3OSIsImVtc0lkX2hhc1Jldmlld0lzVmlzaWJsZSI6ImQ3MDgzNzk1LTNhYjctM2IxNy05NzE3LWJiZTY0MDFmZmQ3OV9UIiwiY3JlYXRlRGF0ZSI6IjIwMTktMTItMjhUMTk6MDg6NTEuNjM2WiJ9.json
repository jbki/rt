All the loose ends were beautifully tied up, Carrie Fisher's passing was handled gently, there was as much nostalgia for those of us who were raised on Star Wars as needed. The space battles were epic. It was suspenseful, Rey's performance was masterful. They dealt with Adam Driver as best as they could have. It had everything I needed in the final film.","displayName":"Jessica M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000286281404/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T19:03:24.087Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T19:03:27.492Z","user":{"userId":"925819289","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jessica M","accountLink":"/user/id/925819289"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie!
