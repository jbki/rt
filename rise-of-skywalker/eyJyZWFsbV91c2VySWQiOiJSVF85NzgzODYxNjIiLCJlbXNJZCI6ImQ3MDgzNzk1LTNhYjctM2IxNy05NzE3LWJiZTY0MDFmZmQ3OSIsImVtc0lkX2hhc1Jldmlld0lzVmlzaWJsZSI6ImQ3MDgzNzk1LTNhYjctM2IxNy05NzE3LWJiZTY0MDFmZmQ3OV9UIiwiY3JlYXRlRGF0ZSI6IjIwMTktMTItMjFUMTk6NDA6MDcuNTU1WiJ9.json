I was personally satisfied with how the storyline played out and I wouldnt have minded it being another 30-45 minutes longer for further character elaboration. Clearly not the end of Star Wars - Im excited to see how things go from here.","displayName":"Matt","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T19:40:02.520Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T19:40:02.520Z","user":{"userId":"2706db78-b190-4e7e-8a66-65ecac30bcd8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Matt","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A flawed, but ultimately satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga.
