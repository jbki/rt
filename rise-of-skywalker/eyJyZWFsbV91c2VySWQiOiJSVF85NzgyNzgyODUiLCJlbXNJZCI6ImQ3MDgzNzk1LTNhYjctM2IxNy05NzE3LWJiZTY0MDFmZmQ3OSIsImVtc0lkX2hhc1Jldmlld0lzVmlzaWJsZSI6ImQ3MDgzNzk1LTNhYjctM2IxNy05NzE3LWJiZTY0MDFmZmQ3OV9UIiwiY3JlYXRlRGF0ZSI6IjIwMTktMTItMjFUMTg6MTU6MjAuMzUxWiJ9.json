It needed to do so much and I think it did so very well. Satisfying conclusion to the newest trilogy and nods to the saga overall.

After that abomination that was The Last Jedi, Abrams turned it out all around as I was hoping he would. I've seen a lot of people complaining online that it was a cheap move to bring Palpatine back, but I think that was one of the best things about the film, the scenes with him and Rey are some of the best we have seen throughout the trilogy. Looking forward to seeing it again.","displayName":"Drei B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:13:41.299Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:14:16.069Z","user":{"userId":"977912810","realm":"RT","displayName":"Drei B","accountLink":"/user/id/977912810"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"For what Abrams had given to him with TLJ, Abrams in my opinion made the correct decisions and ended the saga really well and in a really fun way.
