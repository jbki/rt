Heavy dependency on special effects indicative of star wars but with the new dependence on a plot unfollowable by even the casual star wars fan.  A sad close to something that should have been so much more.","displayName":"Michael H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:22:35.508Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:22:49.785Z","user":{"userId":"976995982","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael H","accountLink":"/user/id/976995982"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good clean fun!

My son and I really liked this movie. I can understand some of the grief about things set up in the last film that were undone, but admittedly I didn't care for most of those choices anyway and the things Abrams added here were largely great. As he so said, no one can please all Star Wars fans.","displayName":"Mark W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:22:26.337Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:22:26.337Z","user":{"userId":"976988529","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark W","accountLink":"/user/id/976988529"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Movie fixed a lot of the issue with Last Jedi and was total fan service! finally!","displayName":"Chris","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:22:12.130Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:22:12.130Z","user":{"userId":"403FCA37-389D-49A7-8F8E-1E47F452F966","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chris","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I thought that JJ Abrams did a great job untying the knot that was The Last Jedi. The pacing of the movie was a bit weird for me. There was no downtime, it just felt like a roller coaster that only did loops or something. There wasn't much build-up from action scene to action scene. \n\nThat being said, I did think that the movie was good and that it does a good job of putting a bow on the whole series.  Don't buy into the click-baiting poison pen reviews.","displayName":"Matthew L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10156174454772002/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:22:07.726Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:22:12.173Z","user":{"userId":"977088833","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew L","accountLink":"/user/id/977088833"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome pulling everything together","displayName":"Dave B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:22:05.513Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:22:05.513Z","user":{"userId":"A45C4C65-7405-4B8C-A85D-4296C048B2C6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dave B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. Felt it respected the original characters and tied everything together in a way that was entertaining and enjoyable. After my disappointment with the last Jedi i was sceptical that it would be any good but I was pleasantly surprised. I say it's worth a watch and is definitely my favourite of the new trilogy.
