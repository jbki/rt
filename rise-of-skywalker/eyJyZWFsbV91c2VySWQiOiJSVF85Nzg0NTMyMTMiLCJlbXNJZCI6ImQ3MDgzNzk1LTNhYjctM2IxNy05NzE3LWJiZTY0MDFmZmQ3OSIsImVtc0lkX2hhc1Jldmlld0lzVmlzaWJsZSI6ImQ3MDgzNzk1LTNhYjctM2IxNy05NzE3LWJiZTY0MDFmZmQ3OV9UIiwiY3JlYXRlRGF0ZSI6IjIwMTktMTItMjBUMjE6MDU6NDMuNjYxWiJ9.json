There were plot points left to the imagination, and unfortunately, I feel as if this wasn't Abrams' intent as the movie's final edit was an already colossal two-and-a-half-hour in length. That time, however, was utilised to execute high quality, blood pumping and tear-jerking entertainment. \n\nFollowing the massive failure that was Rian Johnson's attempt at ruining the Kylo/Rey trilogy, Abrams had a lot of work cut out for himself, mending the almost irrevocable damage - fortunately, he did just that, and so here we are with this fantastic result.","displayName":"David H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2717940588249314/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:05:34.697Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:05:42.301Z","user":{"userId":"978453143","realm":"RT","displayName":"David H","accountLink":"/user/id/978453143"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This movie was about improvement to the movie we cant talk about, I don't know why people say it's the worse movie but it's good and finally Disney wont milk this franchise","displayName":"Alexander M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/317170162147710/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:05:29.696Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:05:37.087Z","user":{"userId":"977289661","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alexander M","accountLink":"/user/id/977289661"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolute roller coaster ride. From a critical standpoint...probably not amazing, but from the standpoint of a fan? Absolutely loved it. It was highly ambitious, and a high degree of difficulty to land properly...and i think the landing was solid. It was very aware of the full arc of the story (including even Easter eggs from Rebels and Clone Wars as well as the previous two trilogies) and did what it could to carry that weight. I'd call it highly emotional with a true heart shot not matched by many movies because of the parallel with real life and the story line. Nothing but pure happiness from the person who has been a fan since he was 9 years old.","displayName":"Greg G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/42105654/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:05:29.168Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:05:35.053Z","user":{"userId":"786285151","realm":"RT","displayName":"Greg G","accountLink":"/user/id/786285151"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"(No Spoilers) Overall, this is a good Star Wars movie! If Empire Strikes Back is a 10/10 and the pinnacle of all Star Wars films, I'd give Rise of Skywalker a 7.5/10. It should have been 20 minutes longer to help the movie breathe a little more to feel slightly less rushed and there was a couple other things I would have liked to have seen and have had explained, but I think it's satisfactory as a whole. I feel like no matter how it would have ended, people would have mixed feelings because nobody is ever truly satisfied, especially in Star Wars where the standard is higher than probably any other franchise. It corrects mistakes from The Last Jedi, has moments that any Star Wars fan will like and it was a safe way to exit the saga. If they had added a couple other things, (surrounding the final battle and some other plot holes) it really could have been a home-run! But, I have to give JJ Abrams credit - he did a lot with the story he was left with after The Last Jedi (and I don't hate The Last Jedi, just have mixed feelings on it, especially Luke's character assassination). The critical reviews are way too harsh - it's a good movie, just not excellent. In my opinion, it deserves a 75% tomato meter score from critics, not the 55-60% it's currently hovering at! Definitely go see this movie if you love Star Wars, I would recommend it!","displayName":"Theodore S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1600824586674745/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:05:24.934Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:05:31.030Z","user":{"userId":"976928396","realm":"RT","displayName":"Theodore S","accountLink":"/user/id/976928396"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"wish I could give it zero stars","displayName":"chuck","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:05:21.095Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:05:21.095Z","user":{"userId":"321C6039-58ED-4452-9117-79041D78D2CC","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"chuck","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It closed the chapter on a very long story, but left little open to explore.","displayName":"Trip H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:05:16.032Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:05:16.032Z","user":{"userId":"978453190","realm":"RT","displayName":"Trip H","accountLink":"/user/id/978453190"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The story was kinda predictable, but it held up in my opinion.

Did you get 180 minute break from reality, see some good fights, some old faves and new faves have stories wrapped up?  Yeah me too, and after a day of thinking about it, I really liked it.  Would've  liked to see a little bit more dog fighting, (watch the last half hour of Rogue One...GORGEOUS) I mean wasn't it glorious seeing B-Wing fighters again?  My personal fave.  I saw the original with my mom in 1977 and pretended to be in the Death Star Trench on the ride home.  Every time it snows (I'm from Canada) I'm pretending to be in the Falcon in outer space (snow looks like stars at night on the highway).  Love Lucas for his creation.
