Lots of impressive special effects and fun action scenes. However the script is not the best and the new Disney trilogy doesn't have consistent storyline between the three movies. Still, this feels like a movie in the Star Wars universe and lots of fun to watch.","displayName":"Vladde B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T22:00:11.753Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T22:02:48.637Z","user":{"userId":"978388814","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vladde B","accountLink":"/user/id/978388814"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Good ending to the saga.
