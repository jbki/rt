Unfortunately, this proved to be too much to achieve. Rise of the Skywalker tries correct the missteps of the previous movie (at least those that could be fixed, because the image of Luke is forever tainted by TLJ), but this prevents it from developing its own story in a natural way.","displayName":"Carlo M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T07:54:49.680Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T07:54:54.634Z","user":{"userId":"977006982","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carlo M","accountLink":"/user/id/977006982"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Eh.
