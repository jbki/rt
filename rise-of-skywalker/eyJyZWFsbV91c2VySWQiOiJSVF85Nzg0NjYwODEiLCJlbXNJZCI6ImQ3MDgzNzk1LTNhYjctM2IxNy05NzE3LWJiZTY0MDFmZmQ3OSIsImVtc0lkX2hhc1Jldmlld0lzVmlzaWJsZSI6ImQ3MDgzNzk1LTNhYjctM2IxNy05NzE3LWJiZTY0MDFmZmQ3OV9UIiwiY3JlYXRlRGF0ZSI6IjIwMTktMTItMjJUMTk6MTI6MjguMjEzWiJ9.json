I had certain lower expectations of the movie then I may be have had going into any Star Wars movie. After seeing the movie I can honestly say it is a very good movie. Now is it the best Star Wars movie probably not. The movie is filled with action and the pace is very good. Though it had a lot of stuff in it because Abrams had the make up for the miss steps of the previous movie the last jedi. He essentially had to create 2 movies and fit them into one but he did a good job at this. Though it didn't flow seamlessly and there is quite a bit of fan service in the movie to the casual Star Wars fan they will not notice. The hardcore fans by no means got everything they wanted in this movie and it didn't go far enough but over all the movie itself is a really good film. It's fun and enjoyable and it is worth going to see.","displayName":"Joseph C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:11:39.482Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:11:52.263Z","user":{"userId":"978466085","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph C","accountLink":"/user/id/978466085"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was amazing!

The humor works well and the action was well done.\n\nThematically inconsistent and disrespectful to The Last Jedi, it's an incompetent and ideologically distant film that seems like it's making it up as it goes along. A disappointing conclusion the the decades-long Skywalker saga.
