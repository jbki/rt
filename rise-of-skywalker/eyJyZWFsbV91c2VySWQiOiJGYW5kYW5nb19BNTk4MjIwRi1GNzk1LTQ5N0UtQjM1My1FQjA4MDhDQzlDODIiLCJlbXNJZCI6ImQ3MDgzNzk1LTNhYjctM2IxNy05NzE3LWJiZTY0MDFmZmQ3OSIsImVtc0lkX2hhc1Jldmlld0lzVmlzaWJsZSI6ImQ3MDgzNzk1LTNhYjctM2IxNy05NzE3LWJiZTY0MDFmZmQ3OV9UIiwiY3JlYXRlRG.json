There has been a lot of anger about particular elements of the story(especially with the new movies) but I believe that Rise of Skywalker finished this story very well!\nI went in expecting Nothing and I am very satisfied with how it all turned out. It's not a masterpiece film, but if you accept the quirks you will definitely have a good experience. Out of all the canonical Star Wars films( Ep. 1-9, Solo and Rogue one) I place it as the 4th best film.\nEnjoy the show!","displayName":"Brendon K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2620708561330702/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T21:53:27.829Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T21:53:34.575Z","user":{"userId":"978475321","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brendon K","accountLink":"/user/id/978475321"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I liked it a lot.
