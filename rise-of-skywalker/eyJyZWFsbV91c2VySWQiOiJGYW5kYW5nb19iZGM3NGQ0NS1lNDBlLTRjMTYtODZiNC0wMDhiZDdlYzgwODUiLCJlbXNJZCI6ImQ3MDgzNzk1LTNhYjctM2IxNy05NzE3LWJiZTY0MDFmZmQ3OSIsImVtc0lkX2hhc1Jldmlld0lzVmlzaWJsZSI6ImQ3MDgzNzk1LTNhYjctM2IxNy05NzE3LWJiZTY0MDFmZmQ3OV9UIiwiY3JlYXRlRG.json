What was the main message? Where is the real tense& why should I be worry about characters I see for the first time and why actually I see them? Where's Rose? Disney, what was that? Did you just follow all those racist harassments against the actress who acted her and support it? \nHow long time do 16 hours take? Couple of days? Weeks? Why does the Imperator have dementor's skills? How did they transport all that space cavalry? What's wrong with Rey?? The only person who'd loved her no matter what had just died on her hands giving his life for her… and what? Nothing. No sorrow, no emotions. \nMeeeehhhhh… it was 2.5 hours of plot holes, pointless scenes, absence of striking twists and nonsense director's decisions. Indeed, Star Wars Saga deserves much better!","displayName":" ","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2786281278089392/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:03:11.897Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:09:30.045Z","user":{"userId":"978466614","realm":"RT","displayName":" ","accountLink":"/user/id/978466614"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"While the movie find ways to be somewhat entertaining, it falls extremely short when it comes to everything else.
