Great movie. Of course some could nitpick some moments, but for me overall made me really happy. \nto say something bad, i would had to say that only made me HATE more the last jedi.

The theater I saw it in was crappy. I’ve been to plenty IMAX theaters and this is the worst. Maybe it’s me but you shouldn’t be able to see the guys head in front of you the entire time and the seats were extremely uncomfortable. I’ll never go to that theater again. It was over priced for a lame take on IMAX viewing.","displayName":"William","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:43:07.753Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:43:07.753Z","user":{"userId":"3B97156E-98A3-4D52-B233-F8344E7C4D82","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"William","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"me gusto mucho por su contenido de remembranzas a las películas anteriores muy emocionante y frenética","displayName":"Dan l","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:43:05.039Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:43:14.932Z","user":{"userId":"962678396","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dan l","accountLink":"/user/id/962678396"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Some great scenes, a lot of bad scenes, felt very rushed and confusing.

The Rise of Skywalker did a tremendous job making up for the mistakes of The Last Jedi. If JJ Abrams made all three movies, this one would have made much more sense. It suffered from some continuity issues as it largely ignored much of The Last Jedi. All in all, this was a very entertaining movie and I would love to watch it again.","displayName":"Tomson L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:43:03.130Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:43:03.130Z","user":{"userId":"978451518","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tomson L","accountLink":"/user/id/978451518"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!!!
