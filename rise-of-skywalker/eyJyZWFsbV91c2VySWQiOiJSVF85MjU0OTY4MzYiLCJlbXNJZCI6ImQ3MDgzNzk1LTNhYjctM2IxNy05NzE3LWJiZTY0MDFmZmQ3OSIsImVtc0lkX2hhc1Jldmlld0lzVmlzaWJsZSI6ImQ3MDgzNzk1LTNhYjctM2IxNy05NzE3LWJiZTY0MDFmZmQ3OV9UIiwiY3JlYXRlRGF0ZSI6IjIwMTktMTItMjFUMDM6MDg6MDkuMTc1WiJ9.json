The biggest crime of this movie is that there is no time given to feel anything.  You are just numb as you go from one set piece to another.  Characters speak, do a thing, and then move on.  There are no real consequences for anyone and overall the movie is just a complete mess that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.","displayName":"Donnie G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T02:48:53.836Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T10:41:05.249Z","user":{"userId":"939521134","realm":"RT","displayName":"Donnie G","accountLink":"/user/id/939521134"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A fitting ending to a generation of storytelling","displayName":"Melissa T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T02:39:07.319Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:41:54.313Z","user":{"userId":"5E5AC8BC-A5F9-41C2-9780-094D9CFC27B7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Melissa T","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a Force-fed fan-feast, stuffed with all the fixins and presented on a silver platter. This final chapter surprised and engaged me with it's nostalgic character moments and frenetic action. Although often preoccupied with retconning much of the previous film, it delivers the goods, while answering some questions along the way. Abrams had quite the turkey to carve. However he succeeds at resolving this 43 year old journey, through charming the audience with respect for the material. Although a messy film, for the most part it's incredibly satisfying and delicious to devour. I probably ate WAY too much, but it doesn't matter. It's a tasty bird, and am going back for seconds. 8/10","displayName":"Shawn M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/731515477/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T02:38:10.379Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T20:49:37.721Z","user":{"userId":"781782441","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shawn M","accountLink":"/user/id/781782441"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie wrapped up the saga nicely and salvaged a mess that was the last jedi.
