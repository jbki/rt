Waited so long for it, and now frustrated after watching it.  The writing is mediocre at best, acting and story are all over the place.  Just a big disappointment.\n\nUpdated: Saw second time, now I see how bad the plot holes are.

No need to over analyze, just try to enjoy the entertainment. Good acting, great action, and amazing special effects. UPDATE: Now after seeing the movie a few times, I like more each time. It truly is a great movie, and if the TLJ didn't waste so much time on the story this movie would feel less rushed. Adam and Daisy are just great actors and are so good in their characters Im left wanting more.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T04:51:37.001Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T15:52:44.524Z","user":{"userId":"953007695","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/953007695"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Star Wars movie yet!","displayName":"Ray C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T04:49:30.437Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T22:56:20.703Z","user":{"userId":"16C11958-ABC2-48D1-9DC1-5F55C1E0F020","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ray C","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"The film was comprised of pretty much nothing but whiplash-inducing pacing that rarely lets things settle for the audience, retcons that disrespect some of the most inspired themes from its predecessors, and plot holes so bad that they not only make the emotional dilemmas of the previous movies completely inconsequential, but they contradict the mythology of the whole series.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the acting and the chemistry between the performances is the best it could have been given the material, the audiovisual presentation was inspired as always, it was funny a decent amount of times, some of the new side characters were precious, the set-pieces were impressive, a couple of scenes managed to be incredibly impactful, and Kylo Ren still manages to be one of the greatest characters in the franchise. In the end though, this turned out to be a disappointing mess and a clear indicator of how poorly planned this trilogy was. Worst Star Wars movie ever.","displayName":"Jean P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000831066522/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T04:48:50.432Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T14:07:46.132Z","user":{"userId":"912212731","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jean P","accountLink":"/user/id/912212731"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved it!  everything was great!  no complaints!

Everything was too forced and Rushed and not very well planned. If you Know nothing of Star wars then it gets a B. Unfortunately most know Star Wars and therefore it gets a D. Some nostalgic moments and a few feel good moments. Great to see Carrie Fisher again done tastefully. Disney did a horrible job if they were really trying to honor What George Lucas has done. Its just a movie and a story line that wrecks everything Lucas and the first six movies gave us. No reason to see it twice. Rogue one was the best thing Disney gave to Star Wars. Thats about it.","displayName":"Paul N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000462528973/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T04:35:30.877Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T13:26:58.656Z","user":{"userId":"919134603","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paul N","accountLink":"/user/id/919134603"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best of the new trilogy by far!","displayName":"PMF","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T04:31:14.782Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T07:43:44.094Z","user":{"userId":"081AA52E-4653-42A4-9A10-9E56CD2CD9D9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"PMF","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
