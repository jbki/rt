However I had the opportunity to watch again and I made myself watch not based on what it could be, but what it was. I didn't let myself judge it by \"they should have done this which would be better\", but by \"how is what they DID do?\" And all in all, after the second watching, I walked out of the theater feeling like it was a good and decent ending to the series. A clean slate was wiped and while it leaves room for more sequels, it's fine the way that it is, as the end of a fantastic series.\n\nSpoiler (kind of?)\nWas really hoping this trilogy for Rey to go Dark Side to save her friends. I love love a good antihero story, and I would have loved to see Star Wars handle that. But it was good none the less.","displayName":"Jessalyn K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1056015924734155/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T23:52:13.356Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T23:52:24.227Z","user":{"userId":"978495153","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jessalyn K","accountLink":"/user/id/978495153"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This was without a doubt the worst film in the saga. The blatant contradictions both internally and with the other films, bizarre and poorly explained narrative choices, and lack of complete arcs for any of the characters among other things make this movie completely incomprehensible. Feels more like a fanfiction written by a 13-year-old in one sitting rather than a studio-backed multi-million dollar film.","displayName":"Michael W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T23:52:10.288Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T23:52:10.288Z","user":{"userId":"978495152","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael W","accountLink":"/user/id/978495152"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"BETRAYAL - ABOMINATION - PLEASE REMOVE THIS NIGHTMARE YOU CALL POST LOGY - I CALL NON STAR WARS - FROM OUR BELOVED SAGA !!!","displayName":"AKW S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T23:51:45.466Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T23:52:02.007Z","user":{"userId":"978495159","realm":"RT","displayName":"AKW S","accountLink":"/user/id/978495159"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"They should have just let the storyline end.

I do like JJ, but you can clearly tell he was restricted by what he wanted to do, and cornered by the ridiculous direction Reyanne took in his \"movie\". Anakin/Vader's sacrifice was completely burned down to the ground. It is a sad state OUR franchise has been left in. I can't give it zero stars cause it hit a few beats, but it didn't make me or anyone I saw it with happy.......and we literally rented an entire theater out to watch it, we do for every SW movie.","displayName":"Brett F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10159224343636980/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T23:51:22.743Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T23:51:36.188Z","user":{"userId":"978495145","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brett F","accountLink":"/user/id/978495145"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The critics are all wrong.  This movie is absolutely FANTASTIC.  As a kid born in the 70's, I've missed out on much of the recent Star Wars craze, let down some by the pre-qual to the original series.  This film left me IN LOVE with the acting.  For once I not only felt overwhelmed with the CGI / graphics... but also the emotion on the big screen.  It was a perfect mix, for a fantastic ending to the series.
