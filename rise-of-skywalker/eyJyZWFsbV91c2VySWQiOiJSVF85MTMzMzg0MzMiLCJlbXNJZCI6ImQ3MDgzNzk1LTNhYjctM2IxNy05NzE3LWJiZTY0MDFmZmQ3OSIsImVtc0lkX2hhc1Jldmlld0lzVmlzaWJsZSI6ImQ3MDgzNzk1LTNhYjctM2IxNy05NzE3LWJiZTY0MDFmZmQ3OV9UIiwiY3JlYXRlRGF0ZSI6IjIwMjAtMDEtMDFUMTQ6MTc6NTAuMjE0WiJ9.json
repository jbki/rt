I didn't care about any of the characters, there was nothing even remotely interesting about the storyline. It was convoluted garbage; with so many stupid conversations that had nothing to do with anything. The movie could have been over in a hour or less. The \"surprises\" were no surprise at all.\n\nThe effects and visuals are very impressive for the most part. Beyond that- the story line, character development, rising action and resolution deeply lacking. Conflicts and characters underdeveloped and resolved so quickly the viewer has little time to even care. Spy? Memory wipe? Dagger? Hidden system? Redemption? Emperor's master plan? Solo's role in redemption? Rey's last name? Did the audience even care when the big conflict was resolved? I sure didn't. And I wanted to care\n\nThere is one giant positive about these sequels. They made people realize the prequels were actually pretty darn good; and that's a impressive feat. This was just that bad.","displayName":"Nicholas R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/730091101/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T14:17:07.906Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T14:17:19.860Z","user":{"userId":"910020962","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nicholas R","accountLink":"/user/id/910020962"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Overall, I liked the movie and I'm glad I saw it on the big screen. The CGI scenery was spectacular and the story line and acting were pretty good. The closing scene was a nice touch. A couple of the light saber fights seemed to go on forever. I regretted not bringing hearing protection. As usual the theater had the volume cranked up loud enough to crack the pavement in the parking lot. Then again, I'm old enough to remember seeing the original Star Wars movie in the theater when it opened in 1977, so take that last comment with a grain of salt. Enjoy the movie!","displayName":"J Henry","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T14:16:33.819Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T14:16:33.912Z","user":{"userId":"b2ba0eac-e86b-4825-a681-d09a16848a58","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"J Henry","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It wasnâ€™t as bad as The Last Jedi!","displayName":"DeAnna H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T14:16:07.367Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T14:16:07.367Z","user":{"userId":"DE66BE5F-B026-4609-BAF1-19B2DD858606","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"DeAnna H","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A little too predictable.

Although nothing can match \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\", watching Darth Vadar appear through a billowing cloud of smoke: ominous, intimidating, and menacing.  But we have a finality to Luke, Leia, and Han and a potential series introducing the exploits of Rey, Finn and Poe, and with so many villains and despotic rulers running governments these days there is more than enough examples of enemies of the people and heroes of the Resistance to write a multitude of sequels.","displayName":"Theresa","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T13:49:01.696Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T14:24:56.710Z","user":{"userId":"2eceebab-5543-498a-9223-1a1fb2c2dad8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Theresa","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It was okay. The cinematography was great. Visually it was a great movie. I just feel like the plot lacked something. Originality maybe. And it was a little heavy with returning original cast members.
