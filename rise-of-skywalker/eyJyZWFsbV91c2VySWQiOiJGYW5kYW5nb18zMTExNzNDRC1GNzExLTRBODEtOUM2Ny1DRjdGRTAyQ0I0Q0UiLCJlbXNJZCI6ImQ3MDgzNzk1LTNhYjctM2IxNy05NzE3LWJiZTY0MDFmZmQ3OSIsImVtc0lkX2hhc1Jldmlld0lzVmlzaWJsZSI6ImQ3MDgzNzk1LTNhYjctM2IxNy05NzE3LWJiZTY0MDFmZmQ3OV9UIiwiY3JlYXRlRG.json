That being said I was slightly disappointed in many of the directions the movies decided to go after Return of the Jedi. Midichlorians, Greedo shooting first, bad green screen prequels, Jar Jar, kiddie level sequences, life resurrecting force powers, etc. I am glad that Snopes was explained as well as Leia's Jedi training. It was a fan movie and unless you discovered the series as a kid it will work with you on a different level. Of course it has it flaws but not so much as the prequels and TLJ. I enjoyed it very much.","displayName":"Marc R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T20:21:29.667Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T20:21:29.667Z","user":{"userId":"7D7B5A22-E6EB-4520-928C-474F07D09EDD","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Marc R","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Of all the movies I've watched this year, this was easily the worst one. The first time I watched it, I couldn't believe what I was seeing, because if honestly felt like fanfiction written by a 13 year old. This movie completely ignores the previous two and tries to fit the story of a whole trilogy in one movie. It feels rushed and lazy, and they tried to hide that behind nostalgia and pretty visual effects. The second time I watched it (I only went because my friends wanted me to go with them) I was bored out of my mind and all I wanted was to leave. This movie also completely undermines the original trilogy, which is absurd. So, save your money and go watch something else.","displayName":"MARI O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T20:20:42.085Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T20:20:46.449Z","user":{"userId":"978492787","realm":"RT","displayName":"MARI O","accountLink":"/user/id/978492787"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"}]}
