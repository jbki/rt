How wrong I was - this was everything I wanted from a star wars film. It's a shame that some of the plot had to be rushed through, particularly at the start, but this is more the last Jedi's failure than anything. Can't wait to see it again! I'll just have to leave an awkward Episode 8 shaped hole in my collection...","displayName":"Alun D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/527910227/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T16:17:49.883Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T16:26:55.173Z","user":{"userId":"976945648","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alun D","accountLink":"/user/id/976945648"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Such a good way to tie up loose ends and finish out the saga.
