The movie fixed a lot of the problems true Star Wars fans disagreed with from the last Jedi. If you are a true Star Wars fan you will enjoy this movie. Critics will disagree with a lot of the choices and Star Wars lore that the rise of Skywalker Included.  The new powers the force shows in this film are new to the big screen but not to Star Wars lore. It was very exciting to see, and glad JJ Abrams picked up where he left off from the force awakens. The movie definitely distances it's self from the last Jedi rightfully so. It is not a perfect film by any means.  The movie is very fast-paced and never a dull moment.  Most critics will disagree with the ending but the rise of Skywalker had to have an ending and critics would have disagreed with any ending Disney or George Lucas would have made. If you are a true Star Wars fan you will enjoy this movie and make it a part of your Star Wars journey. May the force be with you.","displayName":"Matt M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1372740705/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:01:02.723Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:15:09.039Z","user":{"userId":"899912363","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt M","accountLink":"/user/id/899912363"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"A mixed bag of good and pretty bad decisions JJ took.","displayName":"Yaron V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:00:41.610Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:00:49.387Z","user":{"userId":"978451059","realm":"RT","displayName":"Yaron V","accountLink":"/user/id/978451059"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It was fine for what it was. felt like a apology for TLJ.

EP 9 tied up every loose end left open in EP 8.  It was much less corny than previous films and also did a great job of dropping easter eggs from past films all over.
