Well, at the very beginning, to start, which serves as a reactionary hard reset after the odious fan discourse that met the previous film, choosing to reverse course or completely ignore everything that made THE LAST JEDI worthwhile and interesting, performing fanservice not only to a sense of encyclopedic (or wookieepedic) nostalgia like THE FORCE AWAKENS did, but subservience to the rage of the base (and so a true symptom of our awful times). In working to explicitly countermand Rian Johnson's point of view‚Äîno doubt imperfect, but which injected the franchise with social relevance and artistic integrity‚Äîthe result is a film with nothing of its own or of interest to say, functioning more as an apology for having attempted to saying anything whatsoever the last time around. From the first frame to the last, the filmmakers have utterly given into their own fear and/of the hatred of their cult-like audience, so that despite what ostensibly happens in terms of the (Imaginary) narrative, structurally speaking the film (Symbolically) belongs to the Dark Side, treating Emperor Palpatine as the true savior of the Star Wars Universe. One needs only track the arc of Kylo Ren to see this point, as he goes from embodying the worst sort of white male teen toxic fandom, the sort of person who becomes a school shooter in the earlier films to literally rewarded in the end with the damsel in distress, a complete kowtowing to, well, the white male teen toxic fandom. Utterly afraid of the fallout from the last outing, JJ's second entry‚Äîmore a sequel to the first film than the last of a trilogy‚Äîproves once again that the director completely fails to understand, or is simply fearful of, consequences. For a film that is supposed to signal the completion of a series, that is supposed to offer something of a conclusion, that should in some meaningful way offer a feeling of finality, any semblance of conclusiveness is absolutely undercut as the undead rise and speak again and again, the most meaningful moments of the entire series upturned and made worthless as the zombie essence of late capitalism shows itself to have always existed, even a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.","displayName":"Jake C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10100158086500388/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:55:43.401Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:55:46.403Z","user":{"userId":"976528324","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jake C","accountLink":"/user/id/976528324"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great !
