But as a lifelong Star Wars fan, I found this film to be the most enjoyable of the latest trilogy. I'll never forgive this trilogy for the way it handled the legacy heroes (particularly Luke) but this film does its best to fix some mistakes. While having some fun and amazing special effects along the way.","displayName":"Billy20 S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:36:19.863Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:36:40.327Z","user":{"userId":"977343949","realm":"RT","displayName":"Billy20 S","accountLink":"/user/id/977343949"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Easily the best of the Disney Star Wars movie... if you miss this because of the critics your missing out.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:36:12.382Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:36:12.382Z","user":{"userId":"942485148","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/942485148"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great way to finish the story!","displayName":"Steve R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:35:55.530Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:36:09.300Z","user":{"userId":"978471182","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steve R","accountLink":"/user/id/978471182"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The ending was not as final and as emotional as I'd hoped.

The negativity was crazy out of control and what I found was pretty darn good movie. No Star Wars movie will ever be perfect to the hard core ST fan. I put this move in my top 5 ST movies. It was entertaining and i'm ok with the way they ended the series. Go see it and make up your own mind and don't go by what others think.","displayName":"David K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:34:25.601Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:34:28.773Z","user":{"userId":"978471094","realm":"RT","displayName":"David K","accountLink":"/user/id/978471094"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I thought the movie was good.  A movie is a stand alone thing and star wars lore is another thing. I think the movie was entertaining and the story revitalises some things that were destroyed by the last jedi. However I dont think this movie adds anything of value to the star wars lore. None of the movies in this trilogy have but this movie is the best of the 3. JJ did a very good job of retconning the story and regaining some context. However there are also some jump the shark moments with the use of the force. That is forgiveable because the story moves along quickly and you dont focus on it. Kylo Ren has a good story arc. I couldnt point to anything specific that \"this part was great or that part was great\" I just think it works successfully as 1 whole piece.","displayName":"Liam H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:34:16.237Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:36:38.509Z","user":{"userId":"975641400","realm":"RT","displayName":"Liam H","accountLink":"/user/id/975641400"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I had a lot of expectations, and some definite fears when arriving to watch this movie. It is a incredibly needed ending to a saga that is precious to so many peoples' hearts. \n\nI am so grateful for the ending that was delivered. It was full, it was so much to absorb at once. I cannot wait to own this film and to enjoy it time and time again with my future husband.\n\nIt's easy to be overly critical of the Star Wars cinematic works, but I would encourage you to see this film, and to hold a few ounces of grace in your heart- and just ENJOY. Just enjoy this. \n\nNo over done flat humor / relief. It is real, it connects with foreshadowing from earlier films, and it creates spaces for so many. It lacked little. It held much.","displayName":"Kimberley J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000146986199/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:33:45.705Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:33:48.345Z","user":{"userId":"952919438","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kimberley J","accountLink":"/user/id/952919438"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"}]}
