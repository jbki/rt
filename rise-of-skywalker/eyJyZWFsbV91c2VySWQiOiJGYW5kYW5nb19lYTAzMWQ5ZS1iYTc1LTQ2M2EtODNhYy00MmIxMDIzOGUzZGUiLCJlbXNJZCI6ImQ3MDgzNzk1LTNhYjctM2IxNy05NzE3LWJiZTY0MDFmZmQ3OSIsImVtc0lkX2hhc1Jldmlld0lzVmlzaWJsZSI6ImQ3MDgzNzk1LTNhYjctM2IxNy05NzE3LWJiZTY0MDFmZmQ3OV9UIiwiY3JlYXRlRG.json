As a stand alone film it has some charm but in the grand scheme of the saga it was truly disappointing to see the potential of of this film go to waste to save Disney's face.","displayName":"Rio M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1275157375/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T07:29:43.245Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T07:29:58.188Z","user":{"userId":"907059303","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rio M","accountLink":"/user/id/907059303"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Loved it in the end. First 45 minutes was a little rushed but after that it was excellent. Good way to wrap up the saga. Rotten tomatoes critics really got this one wrong. Star Wars fans loved it and let's face it, it is the fans who matter not the critics. It wasn't until the day after that I realised that the film is very much like a previous film in the original trilogy. There are a lot of similar elements but that doesn't spoil it at all. For me not quite as good as Last Jedi but still a great film.","displayName":"Ron J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2100379413530939/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T07:28:29.546Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T07:28:35.557Z","user":{"userId":"977249940","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ron J","accountLink":"/user/id/977249940"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Wish they would of had the story planned out before they made the trilogy.","displayName":"Mitchel G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2616769175043702/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T07:24:30.910Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T07:24:40.744Z","user":{"userId":"978497903","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mitchel G","accountLink":"/user/id/978497903"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I could see why you might not like it but I joyed this movie quite alot","displayName":"Eli C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/974261856289552/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T07:23:47.581Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T07:24:00.591Z","user":{"userId":"978497905","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eli C","accountLink":"/user/id/978497905"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Epic conclusion to the skywalker saga.
