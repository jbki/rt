I was expecting something a bit worse, as I very much disliked ep. 7, but this was an improvement. J J Abrams did way better if it was him that wrote the script fully. The movie went by fast - too fast. In comparison with the Last Jedi, episode 9 was fast, lacking slow scenes, while Last Jedi felt long, but not because there were boring scenes. It was fun and emotional. My eyes watered in 2 scenes of the movie. Spoilers: I did not like Rey calling herself a Skywalker. She's a Palpatine, and she's afraid to accept the truth. Rey is also too overpowered, like, without training, she is pretty powerful with the force/lightsaber. The movie felt short because it was kind of rushed in some parts. Go watch the movie (watch all the episodes before if you haven't)...","displayName":"Mike K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T02:58:54.278Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T02:59:02.282Z","user":{"userId":"977685807","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike K","accountLink":"/user/id/977685807"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great movie, the battle scenes were awesome","displayName":"Daryl","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T02:57:14.582Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T02:57:14.582Z","user":{"userId":"8BEA0F14-C90B-481C-AB48-4781BD7F87EC","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Daryl","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"With the amount of story  lines they had to tie up I thought it was done really well with sensitivity, intelligence, and strength.","displayName":"JpLL","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T02:52:26.564Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T02:52:26.564Z","user":{"userId":"1b5041b4-480d-4aba-a7ff-da901d02e76d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"JpLL","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"We all loved the movie.","displayName":"Maria C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T02:51:08.577Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T02:51:08.577Z","user":{"userId":"8438E0C3-622E-4E30-88DB-DD1633B2B41E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Maria C","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"We loved the action, humor, and story line!","displayName":"Laura","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T02:49:46.030Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T02:49:46.030Z","user":{"userId":"b710437d-c356-44d0-82fe-e43eb45fede7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Laura","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was a great movie.
