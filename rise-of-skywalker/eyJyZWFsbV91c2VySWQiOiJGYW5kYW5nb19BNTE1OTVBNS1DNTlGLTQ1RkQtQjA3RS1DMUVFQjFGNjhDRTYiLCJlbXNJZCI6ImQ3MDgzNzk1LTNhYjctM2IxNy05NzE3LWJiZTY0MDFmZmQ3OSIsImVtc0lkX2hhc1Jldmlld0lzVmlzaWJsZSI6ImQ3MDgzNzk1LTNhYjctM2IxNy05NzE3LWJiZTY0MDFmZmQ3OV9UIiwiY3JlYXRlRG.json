Also, C-3PO was supposed to have his memory erased and then they just bring it back, not that anyone cares about him. They kill of Leia which wasn't the problem but how they did it. Kylo Ren can still have the talks with Ray even if Snoke is dead who was the one that made that happen in the last film. It was a very messy film with many problems but I did overall think it was better then the last movie.","displayName":"Jared W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2101421306826438/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T13:52:40.431Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T13:52:50.643Z","user":{"userId":"978198581","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jared W","accountLink":"/user/id/978198581"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Check it out itâ€™s worth a watch!!!","displayName":"Joel M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T13:51:44.519Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T13:51:44.519Z","user":{"userId":"7E41AD3A-866F-4130-BBEF-7F5224230FE7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joel M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great end. .......just a good movie overall","displayName":"sSal","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T13:50:28.963Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T13:50:28.963Z","user":{"userId":"E0607408-46A2-4941-A43B-ED502A1D7E98","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"sSal","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"If you're not a Star Wars fan it's fine.  Entertaining popcorn movie but you will forget the plot in a week.  JJ did the best he could with RJs mess.  The sequels are a disaster due to poor planning and scattered execution.  Forgettable at best.  Prequels were not good but At least the plot points and connections were solid.  These are a mess for many reasons.","displayName":"Christopher Q","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/529415463/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T13:50:10.317Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T13:50:20.025Z","user":{"userId":"913161408","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christopher Q","accountLink":"/user/id/913161408"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved it!
