Was just a fun journey with a Star Wars feel to it. The first half hour was absolutely perfect. Daisy and Adam absolutely killed this movie. Fun light saber battles.

It was the third act of a much larger (and missing) film that occurs immediately after The Last Jedi but that's fans never get to see. It has its moments, some moments of greatness, but it far too often falls flat and fails to do what it was supposed to do; finish the saga with grace and dignity.","displayName":"Sarah P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/728845084/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:31:55.330Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:31:55.330Z","user":{"userId":"913499160","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sarah P","accountLink":"/user/id/913499160"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A fitting end to a story thats been apart of my whole life.","displayName":"Jonathan A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:31:51.495Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:31:51.495Z","user":{"userId":"0DB2F6A0-36DC-4D9B-AE59-AD2AF3AED465","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jonathan A","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I don't know what critics are smoking.
