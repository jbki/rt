Under the circumstances after the disaster that The Last Jedi (and The Force Awakens) was, it was almost impossible to create an end to a pointless story so I think J.J. achieves to deliver an acceptable movie with many many plot holes and inconsistencies because of what I said before, but still enjoyable. This saga lost its magic and power due to a poor handling of this trilogy so I recommend you to lower your expectations and to be comprehensive so you can enjoy the movie.","displayName":"Yair P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157771707488560/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:20.714Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:31.613Z","user":{"userId":"978445694","realm":"RT","displayName":"Yair P","accountLink":"/user/id/978445694"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This was a great ending for the trilogy, but it suffered from the problems of ttis saga.","displayName":"Marci S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2569197276735873/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:19.275Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:33.961Z","user":{"userId":"978445813","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marci S","accountLink":"/user/id/978445813"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Not a good conclusion to 9 movies they trying to do to much with not enough time","displayName":"Erik E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/756922737/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:16.580Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:20.775Z","user":{"userId":"978445818","realm":"RT","displayName":"Erik E","accountLink":"/user/id/978445818"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Felt like a marvel movie.

Abrams does a great job at salvaging what Johnson left for him in my opinion but the mistake of not giving all three movies to the same director definitely left its mark on Rise of Skywalker and not in the best of ways. Aside from the that and all of the twists which for most part I could see coming from a mile away, I'd say Rise of Skywalker is definitely worth your time, in order to put an end to this flawed yet not terrible trilogy.","displayName":"Dakota Young","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:15.581Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:15.581Z","user":{"userId":"FADF5E0A-06B4-4146-B250-5C6CFE27F36F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dakota Young","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"it completed the storyline.  that's about it","displayName":"Rodney","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:05.527Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:05.527Z","user":{"userId":"B4525E16-DB7A-4C67-BE42-E0DFB6B64404","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rodney","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Finn was the best part of this film and that's why I give it a star.

You will love this movie insight of a few things. Those things aren't this movies fault there the last movies fault. I go to movies like this as an adult because it is an escape a FANTASY NOT REALITY and a call back to my youth. I Got that with the force awakens and I totally got that with this. I didnt get into the venom and debate of The Last Jedi  I'll just say instead of a middle picture that is supposed to continue to set up the overall story and set up the Final act of a trilogy it didnt it was basically like a second 1st movie it also totally wasted Mark Hamil and did poo poo on Luke skywalker that being said the biggest thing I took away after watching this movie is it also missed golden opportunity of having three leads together before final movie. All in all JJ Abrams did wonders with course correcting and trying things up.  Yes would have liked to seen what he would have done if the middle picture wouldn't have been so drastic but he is brilliant and I felt like I was back in A star wars movie.
