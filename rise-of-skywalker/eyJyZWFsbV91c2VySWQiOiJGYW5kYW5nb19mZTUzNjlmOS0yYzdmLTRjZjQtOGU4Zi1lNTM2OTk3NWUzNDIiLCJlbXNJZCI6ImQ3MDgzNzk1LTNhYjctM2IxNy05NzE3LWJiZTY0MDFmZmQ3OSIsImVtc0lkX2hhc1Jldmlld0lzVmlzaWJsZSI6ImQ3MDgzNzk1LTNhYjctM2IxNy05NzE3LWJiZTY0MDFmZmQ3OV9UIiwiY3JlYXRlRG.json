It was understandable, action packed and you could really feel for the characters.  It was very intense, edge of your seat at times.  No spoilers, but liked the outcomes of some situations.

Such a fun adventure with these great characters. However, ultimately I'm disappointed.  Episodes 1-8, no matter how good or bad they were, felt like they had meaningful things to say about the force and what it means to be a hero. I just didn't get that from this one, it felt really empty.","displayName":"Alex P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/22925844/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T16:04:50.798Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T18:29:42.460Z","user":{"userId":"782349769","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex P","accountLink":"/user/id/782349769"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Very entertaining!
