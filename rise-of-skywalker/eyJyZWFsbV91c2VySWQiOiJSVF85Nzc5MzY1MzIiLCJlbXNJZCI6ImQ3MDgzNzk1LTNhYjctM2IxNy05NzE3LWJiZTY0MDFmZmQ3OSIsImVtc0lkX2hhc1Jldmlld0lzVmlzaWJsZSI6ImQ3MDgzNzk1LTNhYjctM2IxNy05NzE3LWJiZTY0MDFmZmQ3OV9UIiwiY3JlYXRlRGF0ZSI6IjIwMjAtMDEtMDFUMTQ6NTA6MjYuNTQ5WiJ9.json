I thought it was a lot of fun and tied up loose ends. It is a very busy movie, for sure - anybody who has issues with motion should sit far away from the screen. The only thing that didn't completely work for me was how they dealt with adding Carrie Fisher - the CGI was a bit stiff and awkward.","displayName":"Amy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T14:49:00.138Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T14:49:00.138Z","user":{"userId":"2f3983d0-89aa-4fde-8190-9e79fc1d01f1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Amy","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I have absolutely no idea what the critics have against this movie.

The way the finale was executed also suffered from this, although the problem here may more with what was going on, with characters doing what can only be described as intensely stupid, or completely unexpected things which just served to ruin the immersion, although it did provide some involuntary humour. There also weren't any especially amazing pieces of cinematography or choreography in the movie, which was somewhat disappointing considering the track record so far. In the context of being a Star Wars movie this overall added up to make a deeply dissatisfying experience which made me wish I hadn't watched it.","displayName":"Benji F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/616925665331371/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T14:34:11.129Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T14:34:18.936Z","user":{"userId":"977298640","realm":"RT","displayName":"Benji F","accountLink":"/user/id/977298640"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Trite dialogue, wooden acting, absolutely predictable (and dull) plot.
