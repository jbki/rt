It delivered great action, tied up loose ends, was compelling, the important characters dealt with personal struggles. I think as fans and more importantly as people we need to take a step back and just thank J.J. Abrams and everyone involved and say thank you for giving us another Star Wars movie and for allowing us to once again get lost in the beautifully creative and imaginative world that George Lucas first brought to life. Thank you for 2 and half more hours of a world I hold so dear in my heart.","displayName":"Zach","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T05:15:39.365Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T05:15:39.365Z","user":{"userId":"44E41FB3-E69C-4392-AA4D-44907A259BBC","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Zach","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved the movie!
