Yes!  I went in not expecting much, prepared to pick it apart and give it a review.   The first thing I noticed was the very distinctive Disney \"look\" of the cinematography, and the extensive barrowing from Peter Jackson's treatment of Tolkien.  But then story content just carried me away from myself into a maelstrom feeling states that left intoxicated.  The bare bones plot was eclipsed by the densely packed symbolic story content.  It is actually literature disguised as entertainment.\n\nIt may be the best movie I've ever seen.  It put JJ Abrams back on my \"must see\" director list.","displayName":"Kenneth S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T14:31:17.702Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T14:31:17.702Z","user":{"userId":"ff8c6b38-427d-49a4-ac52-45f2bb06a3ac","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kenneth S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"We did enjoyed this movie","displayName":"Aime Pinto","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T14:30:43.467Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T14:30:43.467Z","user":{"userId":"508d5295-e6d1-4836-9892-438b367ce81f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Aime Pinto","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Disney never should have purchased Star Wars.
