It is a terrific finale, balances out the darkness withe a \"campiness\" that is classic star wars movies.

It pays homage to the old, while still coming back with new and fresh ideas that have not yet been referenced in the storyline before. The nostalgia alone will give you goosebumps, and the action/story will keep you at the edge of your seat for the entirety of the movie. Most importantly, it closes out the 9-movie-long story line with great closure and satisfaction. Overall, sincerely satisfying and thrilling.","displayName":"Marcus H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000750897065/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T20:07:59.511Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T20:08:03.144Z","user":{"userId":"978484554","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marcus H","accountLink":"/user/id/978484554"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Well done!

Plot holes, bad writing and utter nonsense aside- this movie, as the rest of this horrific mess of a trilogy does,  ignores, nay,  takes a steaming dump on the first six movies.  Did the writers even watch them??  the ultimate slap in the face was that ridiculous Mary Sue (aka Rey) taking the Skywalker name.   Are you kidding me??  If you're a true, life long fan of the franchise, don't waste your money on this drek.
