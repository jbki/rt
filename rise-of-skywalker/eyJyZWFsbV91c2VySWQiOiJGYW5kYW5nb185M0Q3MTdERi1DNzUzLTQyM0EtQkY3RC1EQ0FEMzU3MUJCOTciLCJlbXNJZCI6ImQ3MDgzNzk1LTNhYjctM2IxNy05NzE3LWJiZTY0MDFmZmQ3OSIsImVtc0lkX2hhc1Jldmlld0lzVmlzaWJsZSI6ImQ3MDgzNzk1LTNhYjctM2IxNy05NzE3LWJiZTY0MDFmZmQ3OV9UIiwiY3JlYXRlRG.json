And his real death was insanely cliche and unneeded. How about for once a young sith man finds his way back to the light and “there is coming home again!”  How about he is able to turn everything around and do some good for the galaxy  like bring about a new and healthy actual balance to the Force along with Rey?  Maybe raise up some Grey Jedi’s finally?  Anything but keep falling into the same pattern.","displayName":"Patricia","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T19:24:15.088Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T19:24:15.088Z","user":{"userId":"FA0F048F-FC13-4B9E-8CFB-A34335CB4936","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Patricia","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good sequel.good action not the best of Star Wars","displayName":"Adriana V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T19:24:08.981Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T19:24:08.981Z","user":{"userId":"3F107C2D-085B-4059-98EB-239D2C1DBA7B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Adriana V","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Really enjoyed it! Didn't have much hope for this movie after Last Jedi. Was amazed that JJ managed to solve so many problems and tie off so many plot threads in a satisfying way. Yes it feels a bit rushed but there was no avoiding that frankly.
