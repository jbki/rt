Some parts made no sence however (The sith dagger), Rey being Palpatine and the ending wasn't good. Ben deserved a better end. Rey and Ben saved each other, but Bens sacrifice without mourning from anyone was terribly sad. He should have at least appeared as a ghost with Leia and Luke... and Anakin.Finn suddenly being force sensitive was possibly what he wanted to confess to Rey... idk, I believe that Ben was saves somehow, but mostly he saves Rey in the end and her living alone in Lukes old house made sence... but I wish Ben have gotten a chance to live too... it would have been a happy ending...","displayName":"Veronika A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10155623708848764/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T10:11:56.810Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T10:21:23.597Z","user":{"userId":"977264016","realm":"RT","displayName":"Veronika A","accountLink":"/user/id/977264016"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My duaghter and I really enjoyed it.

It seemed like they were trying to completely retcon the last jedi, pack in as much fan-service as they could, and barely tried to work that into a story. As someone who's been a fan of Star Wars my whole life, it felt very hollow and pandering.\n\nIf all you want from a Star Wars movie is fan-service moments and you don't care if the pacing is awful and the barebones plot doesn't make sense, then you'll like this movie.","displayName":"Toby W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T10:05:43.683Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T10:17:08.209Z","user":{"userId":"978479468","realm":"RT","displayName":"Toby W","accountLink":"/user/id/978479468"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"}]}
