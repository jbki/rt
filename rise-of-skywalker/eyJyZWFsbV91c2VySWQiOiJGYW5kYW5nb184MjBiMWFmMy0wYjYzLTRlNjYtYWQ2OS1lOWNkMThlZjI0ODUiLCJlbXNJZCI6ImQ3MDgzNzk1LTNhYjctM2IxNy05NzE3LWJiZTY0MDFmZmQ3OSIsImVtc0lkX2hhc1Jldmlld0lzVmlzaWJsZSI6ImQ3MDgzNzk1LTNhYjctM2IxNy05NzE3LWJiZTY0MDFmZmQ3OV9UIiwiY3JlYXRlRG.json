Though I just give it 4.5 stars as I was disappointed with the lightsaber fights. Lightsabers are not heavy! For some reason, the lightsabers fights lost its elegance! Ben Solo should have lived and Rey died! It subvert expectations that Rey is the main character all this time, but it's actually Ben! He is the true Skywalker!
