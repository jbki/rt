The pacing was terrible and had too many things happening at once. It felt like JJ Abrams was trying to fit his original plans for Episode 8 into the movie to rectify the change of direction in the last film especially after learning so much happened off screen during the title scrawl. From telekinetic chain snatching to telekinetic flirt-fighting this is another film that sacrifices their side characters arcs and importance in order to make Rey stand out. \n\n2 telekinetic chain snatches out of 5.","displayName":"Anthony T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:27:09.302Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:27:09.302Z","user":{"userId":"0bcf1d99-af29-4066-935a-3645059dc6c6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Anthony T","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie was a mess. The first 45-60 minutes was like I was on a roller coaster. The greatest character that was destroyed in the Last Jedi was not redeemed. I did not leave the movie this time like a truck ran over me 10 times like I did with the Last Jedi. I had no emotion at all just seemed blah. Star Wars was everything to me the mythology to the heros journey, now it is just a movie which seems so strange to me. The only way Disney will be able to recapture the fans is to fix Luke Skywalker.","displayName":"Ryan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:26:23.670Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:26:23.670Z","user":{"userId":"e58ce809-e7bc-46a8-ad46-8a7b2bda2dc0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ryan","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"I've had a bad feeling about this.

Can't Say its great but it got the bad taste out the mouth that the last jedi left. JJ Spends alot of time fixing the mistakes and lack of respect that the previous movie had done. Very fast paced and often you're left feeling what just happened before the next big thing is going on. I believe if they had brought in Palpatine gradually into the movie and helped us understand just what, why, and how he's still around it would've set better. The lack of Anakin is sad in my opinion... He was supposed to be the chosen one, who brings balance. Instead Rey grabs the credit. Maybe thru Ben aka Kylo?! Lots of emotional connection in this one and if you're a fan at all it'll pull heart strings a bit in the movie. I highly reccomend and commend The efforts from JJ trying to fix the wrongs if he'd agreed to the triology we might have been set off into the sunset with an honest triology. Special effects are spot on and keeps you at the edge of your seat. Made a lasting impression on the hopes of Star Wars in the future, for me at least. Lastly May The Force Be With You... Always!!","displayName":"Mike H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157201882237876/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:25:29.917Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:25:38.650Z","user":{"userId":"978461146","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike H","accountLink":"/user/id/978461146"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"J.
