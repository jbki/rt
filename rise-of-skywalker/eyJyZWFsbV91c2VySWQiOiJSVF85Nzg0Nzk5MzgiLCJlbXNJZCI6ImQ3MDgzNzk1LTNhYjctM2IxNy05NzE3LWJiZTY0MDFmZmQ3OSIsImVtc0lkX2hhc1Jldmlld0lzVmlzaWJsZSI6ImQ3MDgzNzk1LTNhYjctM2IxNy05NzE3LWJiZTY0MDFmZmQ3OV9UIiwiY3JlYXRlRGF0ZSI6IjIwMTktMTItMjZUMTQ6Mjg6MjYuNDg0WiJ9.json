The character, Rose Tico, was ridiculous throughout the trilogy.  A lowly mechanic, to fighter pilot, to foot soldier??  A waste of screen time and was not a \"lead actress\" as billed.  The movie also introduced another new force power, that was ridiculous.","displayName":"Bill","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T14:27:07.684Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T14:27:10.028Z","user":{"userId":"118d5d41-5e0c-4a3c-9dbc-02e31c1f4394","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bill","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A little long, a lot to take in.

The Rise of Skywalker is hugely different compared to The Last Jedi, I think having two different directors is the main reason why this trilogy wasn't as well reviewed as it could have been, JJ Abram's vision was completely set of course by Rian Johnson's. It is very obvious to me whilst I was watching this movie that JJ Abrams ''fixed'' storylines Rian Johnson had set up, I did like the direction this movie went in but thought the ending wasn't as satisfying as it could have been.","displayName":"Flemming V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T14:25:22.116Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T14:25:28.683Z","user":{"userId":"978338010","realm":"RT","displayName":"Flemming V","accountLink":"/user/id/978338010"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"86% is a lie!!!!
