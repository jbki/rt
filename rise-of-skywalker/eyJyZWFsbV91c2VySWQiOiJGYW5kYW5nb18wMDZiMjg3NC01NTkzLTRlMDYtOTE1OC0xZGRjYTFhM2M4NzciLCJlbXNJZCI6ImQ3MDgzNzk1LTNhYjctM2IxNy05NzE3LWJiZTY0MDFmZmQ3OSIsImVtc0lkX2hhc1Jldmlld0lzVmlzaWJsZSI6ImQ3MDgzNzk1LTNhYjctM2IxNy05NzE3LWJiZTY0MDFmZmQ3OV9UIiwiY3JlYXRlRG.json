Excellent special effects, action, space battles , and acting by Daisy Ridley with a good mix of Fin and Poe banter through out. While it does have some pacing issues and could have used additional explanation for certain plot points , it was not to a degree that I found offensive or unbelievable. Regardless of your feelings on The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi, come with an open mind and prepare for a wild Star Wars ride.
