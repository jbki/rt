With the last jedi being a epic failure they had to push something into this movie in hope of making it interesting. The plot was confusing, rushed, and didnt make much sense. We still have many unanswered questions which the trilogy was supposed to close out. This trilogy has ruining many aspects of star wars such as the understanding of light sabers as well as light speed. It's amazing how the cheapened the training and abilities of the jedi. According to this trilogy jedi minium training and anyone can pick up and skillfully wield a light saber. The dialogue in this movie was generic at best. It seems to be on the same level as a middle school play.  Complete waste of time and money.","displayName":"Chris E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157306329557508/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:32:29.796Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:34:28.833Z","user":{"userId":"978222637","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris E","accountLink":"/user/id/978222637"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"it was meh, palpatine coming back never got explained. every ship was a death star, warp jumps still split ships in two","displayName":"yetipicklez","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:32:16.239Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:32:16.239Z","user":{"userId":"F2B789DC-0474-4C5C-982C-2093836A25AC","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"yetipicklez","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Painful to watch, I love Star Wars, this was not it.
