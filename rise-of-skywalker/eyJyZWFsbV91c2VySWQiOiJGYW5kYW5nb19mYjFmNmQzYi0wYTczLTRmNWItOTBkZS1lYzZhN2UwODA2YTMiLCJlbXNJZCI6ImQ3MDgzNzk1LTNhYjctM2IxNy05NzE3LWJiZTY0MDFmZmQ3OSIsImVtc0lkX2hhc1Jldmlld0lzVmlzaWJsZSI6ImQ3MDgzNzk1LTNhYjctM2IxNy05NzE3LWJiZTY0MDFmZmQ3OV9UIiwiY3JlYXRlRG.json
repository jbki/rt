I was one eyelash away from falling asleep during the first hour. What was with the close ups of Daisy Ridley every 50 seconds? The first entry way back in a Galaxy far far away, Star Wars, was ground breaking in so many ways. Empire Strikes Back was a terrific, if not better, second act with Return of the Jedi an acceptable and satisfying conclusion. Since then, with perhaps the exception of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the franchise has been far far inferior...","displayName":"Goobalee G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:54:16.255Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:54:16.255Z","user":{"userId":"978489799","realm":"RT","displayName":"Goobalee G","accountLink":"/user/id/978489799"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"This was a bleak ending to a family saga to kill off the bloodline of the family that this whole saga is about.  Could have been the best and ended with hope but even Rey taking the name saying she found her family The Skywalker's are all dead how is that hope that even though you found your belonging they are all dead your still alone.  Its a tragic tale. Love how Star Wars creates this dyad for Rey and Ben only for it to mean nothing for the battle against Sidious it only gives Sidious life and when it comes down to each other does nothing.  If Leia gave the rest of her life to Ben it would have mirrored The Daughter of Mortis she was dying and gave life back to a dead Ashoka Leia body disappearing and Ben coming back and told Rey my mom bought me back ðŸ˜­   If Ben and Rey had a hopeful end it would have made More Money and I would have loved this movie.  #BenSololives. #Bendeservedbetter","displayName":"Daisy J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:54:14.278Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:54:59.854Z","user":{"userId":"977297675","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daisy J","accountLink":"/user/id/977297675"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Enjoyable and fun, good to see all of the Star wars characters","displayName":"Bill","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:52:59.700Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:52:59.700Z","user":{"userId":"f8b2c140-715f-4518-a5da-9ec820f348d8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bill","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"The movie's story line was comically bad with fan fiction level of writing. The ending scene had multiple people in the audience with me laughing because of how ridiculous it was; not to mention the gentleman behind me snoring at a 3 o'clock showing. The special effects; however, are second to none. This movie was saved by the excellent work by the women and men in the special effects department. If you're looking for a visually stunning movie, look no further than ROS but don't expect to understand anything unless you have extensive knowledge of the Star Wars expanded universe.","displayName":"Tyler S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/825708115/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:52:16.712Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:52:25.062Z","user":{"userId":"978489807","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tyler S","accountLink":"/user/id/978489807"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Movie was fantastic!!
