This movie feels completely disjointed from the last 2 movies in this trilogy because it had to be. I personally think J J Abrams did the best he could with what he was given, especially considering how little time he had to put this together. That doesnt excuse this movie, but it does help to soften the blow. Had this trilogy been planned out from the beginning, then both episodes 8 and 9 would have been better off. At the end of the day, this movie has too much shoved into, it is the most fast passed exposition dump I have ever watched. None of the twists or surprises have any impact because of how fast this movie rushes you to the next scene. There is never a break of any kind so you can attempt to digest and react to what you've just seen. This movie is better than the last jedi, in my opinion, but that's not saying much, so I'll just say, you can at least have fun with this movie. Unless you're a fan of the last jedi then you will absolutely despise this movie.","displayName":"Damon","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T03:51:56.198Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T08:18:49.633Z","user":{"userId":"94F294A2-4480-4324-A9D5-1EE1FBEC2433","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Damon","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Really good movie can’t believe people don’t like this.","displayName":"Kelvin","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T03:49:45.559Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T03:49:45.559Z","user":{"userId":"7F403877-BD0D-41E1-84FC-38CAB87F663F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kelvin","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very good.

It was a big task to end these series of Movies. I don’t understand the critics hate for this movie. It’s better than all 3 prequels. There are issues like some conveniences they make to end the story. But I especially enjoyed Daisy Ridleys portrayal of Rey. One thing I didn’t like was the look of the climactic space battle. The Light Saber duel earlier in the film with Kylo and Rey was the best part. Overall I can see if people have issues with the film but I enjoyed it.","displayName":"Ben S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T03:40:26.948Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T03:40:26.948Z","user":{"userId":"5A7047C8-94D5-4111-8B7D-F7AF1E5E3B10","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ben S","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"It was a good ending to the Skywalker saga, however there were many things that I just didn't like.
