It is a terrible movie that everybody is waiting to the end to get out of the theater (if you were able to handle it) I hope it is the last movie, you cannot stretch any longer the story . I like Star Wars movies, and I do believe there is material for spinoff such as  Rogue One; unfortunately this last trilogy was the worst thing that could happen to the  Franchise.","displayName":"Carlos E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1019407874/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T05:08:57.574Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T05:09:04.157Z","user":{"userId":"937047670","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carlos E","accountLink":"/user/id/937047670"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was amazing would watch again","displayName":"Nick J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T05:07:51.666Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T05:07:51.666Z","user":{"userId":"1CC5A53C-097E-4104-BCA4-A901F395EA94","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Nick J","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"There is a lot of them doing stuff and not a lot of explaining the stuff.","displayName":"Jesse","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T05:04:48.888Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T05:04:48.888Z","user":{"userId":"E102CD38-0368-4274-9325-88886215E054","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jesse","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Liked how it ended.
