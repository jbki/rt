It's got a plot that reads like fan fiction, and at times the dialogue is cringeworthy.  None of it makes any sense.  It's Star Wars, just faster and more dumb.  I like this less than The Last Jedi, and I hated that movie.  Sad that the whole trilogy could've been, and should've been, so much better.","displayName":"Josh J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T01:19:51.971Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T16:26:35.110Z","user":{"userId":"940520116","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josh J","accountLink":"/user/id/940520116"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"The Emperor is back because...?

The Rise of Skywalker is full of new places and nods to old, new characters and further development of the core three, and a satisfying end of the arc for the last three films. Is it the last \"Skywalker\" movie? Time will tell. But my family and I had a blast.","displayName":"Mark T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T00:35:50.788Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T00:35:50.788Z","user":{"userId":"960983291","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark T","accountLink":"/user/id/960983291"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"May the Force move on with in us all!!!!","displayName":"Dawnmichel","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T00:35:46.237Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T00:35:46.237Z","user":{"userId":"D996F8B1-40E5-4D2E-AADD-E508342C597F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dawnmichel","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"What more do you want!?!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T00:35:45.363Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T00:35:45.363Z","user":{"userId":"260018251","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260018251"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It brings all the other 8 movies full circle!!!
