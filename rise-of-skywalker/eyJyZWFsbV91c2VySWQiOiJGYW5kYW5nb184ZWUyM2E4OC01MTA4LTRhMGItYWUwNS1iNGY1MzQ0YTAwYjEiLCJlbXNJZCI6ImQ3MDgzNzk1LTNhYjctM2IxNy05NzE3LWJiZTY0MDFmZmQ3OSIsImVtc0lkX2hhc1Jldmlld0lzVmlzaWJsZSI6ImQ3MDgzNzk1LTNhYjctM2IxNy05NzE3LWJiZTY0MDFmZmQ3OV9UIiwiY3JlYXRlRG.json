Great visuals, better character development, and a lot of fan-centered apology hat tips don't quite make up for a plot with more whole than a block of swiss cheese in a grenade store, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. Too bad that direction was steered by Jar Jar.","displayName":"Sean J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1521360063/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T18:37:02.631Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T18:37:06.015Z","user":{"userId":"782761390","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sean J","accountLink":"/user/id/782761390"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Totally reversed “Last Jedi”.
