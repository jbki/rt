It was just a huge amount of fun! Bizarrely, the real enemy of this film was not the dark side, it was 'The Last Jedi' and that has many critics very upset because it means that they need to contradict their adoration of that film to support this one but they need to look beyond that and at how the true character and optimism of the franchise has been restored.

When the climax of the movie came, that precious moment that is supposed to move hearts and drop tears of joy and excitement, that moment was as casual and without meaning as the rest of the movie. In the end, there was no clear stake, no threat, no tension in this cartoonish plot. Only real value of this movie is production value, but it's also the final nail in the coffin for SW.","displayName":"Joan G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/616378785778443/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:30:38.922Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:30:48.446Z","user":{"userId":"978442131","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joan G","accountLink":"/user/id/978442131"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"A nice try for trying to save the last 2 movies but it doesn't compete with the classic at all.","displayName":"Mathias K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10218534469931418/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:30:29.006Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:30:35.823Z","user":{"userId":"978442130","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mathias K","accountLink":"/user/id/978442130"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Before I watch the movie I knew what's going to happen. I've read the leaked plot on the Reddit. I thought this was some joke made by the fans however it turns out it was movie's entire plot. This movie is supposed to be end the 'SKYWALKWER SAGA'. It turns out J.J. Abrams did not his job well. I do understand the plot-holes in the movie. Considering the last movie made by the Rian Jhonson, it divided the fandom. \n\nJ.J needed more time to avid the plot-holes and great ending for the whole saga. Regardless the weak plot , the CGI and the action scenes were improved than the last one. Also seeing the Jedi master Luke Skywalker the way he's supposed to be, is nice feature that director accomplished. \n\nI'm a huge fan for the Star Wars series, this movie was not ended like everyone else hoped for. Still, it's enjoyable movie for everyone and considering this is end for the saga I'm going to miss it. \n\nIt's better than the Last Jedi for sure.","displayName":"Colin k","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:30:24.580Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:30:24.580Z","user":{"userId":"978442074","realm":"RT","displayName":"Colin k","accountLink":"/user/id/978442074"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It is the perfect closure to the saga.
