No, but JJ was never going to please everyone.  Overall Rise of Skywalker was a very enjoyable movie that really did tie up some arcs across all of the trilogies.  I think they should have pushed the run time a bit longer maybe in order to better explain a few of the newer plot points, but then they're pushing Endgame/LOTR territory and I can see why they might want to avoid that.  I almost suspect Disney wanted to leave some things unexplained for potential later side-story movies similar to Rogue One and Solo.","displayName":"Charles P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T07:38:06.048Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T07:38:06.048Z","user":{"userId":"e0748e45-87f5-4b36-9204-8e214407d984","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Charles P","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Low quality disappointing movie","displayName":"Kris H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2618183734934857/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T07:37:52.645Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T07:38:20.827Z","user":{"userId":"978473394","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kris H","accountLink":"/user/id/978473394"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Good.
