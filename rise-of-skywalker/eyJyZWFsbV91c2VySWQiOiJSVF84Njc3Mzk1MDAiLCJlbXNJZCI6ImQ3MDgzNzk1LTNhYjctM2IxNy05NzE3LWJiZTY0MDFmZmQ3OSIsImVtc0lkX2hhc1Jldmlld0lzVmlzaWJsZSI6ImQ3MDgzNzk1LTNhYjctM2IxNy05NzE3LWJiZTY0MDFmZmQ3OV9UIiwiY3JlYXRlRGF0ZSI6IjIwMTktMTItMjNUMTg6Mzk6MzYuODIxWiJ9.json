Who approved the game like quality of their faces... seriously? It did have it's moments mostly surrounding OT characters and the retcon of the abomination that was TLJ. Of course you can't make everyone happy all the time, unless you are the creative mind behind this universe or a true fan. TLJ created too many issues that left this trilogy beyond repair.","displayName":"Craig D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:39:06.319Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:39:26.806Z","user":{"userId":"973086134","realm":"RT","displayName":"Craig D","accountLink":"/user/id/973086134"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Rise of Skywalker does what it needs to do.","displayName":"Peter M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1440708536/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:38:56.819Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:38:56.819Z","user":{"userId":"907820644","realm":"RT","displayName":"Peter M","accountLink":"/user/id/907820644"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It was an epic conclusion. Hands down the better film of the sequel trilogy. It would've been way better if some elements in this episode would've been addressed/introduced in previous episodes so story would be more developed and have more room to play/create. Otherwise, I think most people will be satisfied with this episode.","displayName":"Cylas I","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:37:46.131Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:55:20.694Z","user":{"userId":"41d43a0c-264f-4144-9437-d18839db25d9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Cylas I","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"It was terrible.

Will attract new fans and demonstrates that the star wars universe is actually pretty dark. Reminiscent of KOTR... strong performances from Ridley, Driver and of course McDiarmid.

Felt like watching a YouTube video with cuts every 3 seconds. Mad Max Fury Road was a single long action scene that had more downtime than this. \n\nBetter than Episode 8, but still worse than Episode 2, which is WILD.

Non-stop action but still feels like Star Wars. The Emperor finally seemed as evil and powerful as he should have been all along, and Kylo Rens storyline was satisfying.

After Rian Johnson's headache that was The Last Jedi, JJ Abrams had the difficult task of redeeming an incredibly famous series as well as end it, and he did a great job. Characters are back and as fun as ever, the story is interesting, and the conclusion was satisfying. Overall, Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker is a great conclusion to the Star Wars Saga as well as a great movie in general.","displayName":"Random D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:35:17.847Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:35:29.903Z","user":{"userId":"977306835","realm":"RT","displayName":"Random D","accountLink":"/user/id/977306835"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Thank you for the beautiful movie.
