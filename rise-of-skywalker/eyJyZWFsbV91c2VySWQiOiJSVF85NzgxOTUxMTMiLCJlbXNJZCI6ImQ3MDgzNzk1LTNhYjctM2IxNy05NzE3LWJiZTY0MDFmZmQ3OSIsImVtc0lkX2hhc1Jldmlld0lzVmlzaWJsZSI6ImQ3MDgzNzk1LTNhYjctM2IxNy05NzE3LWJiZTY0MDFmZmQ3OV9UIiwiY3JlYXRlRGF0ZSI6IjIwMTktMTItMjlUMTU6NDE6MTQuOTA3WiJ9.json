This is such a bloated, painfully long disappointment to the saga. Abrams throws in so many fan servicey things that never end up contributing to the narrative as a whole. The Luke Skywalker segments especially are so absurdly dumb, I laughed, and the last long battle scene is so void of any real high stakes, I ultimately tuned out and wanted it to be over as soon as possible. The first half is actually not that bad. It's a bit bland compared to Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Force Awakens, but still has a sense of adventure. The second half of this film completely dies out though and becomes a mish-mash of moments and ideas that never give a satisfying conclusion.","displayName":"John M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/144800364/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:41:05.520Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:41:05.520Z","user":{"userId":"782158336","realm":"RT","displayName":"John M","accountLink":"/user/id/782158336"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The storyline fell right into place!","displayName":"Mario Da Silva","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:40:37.663Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:40:37.663Z","user":{"userId":"a5814104-134f-46f0-8ed3-935e7935d11e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mario Da Silva","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The story line kept me on the edge of my seat.
