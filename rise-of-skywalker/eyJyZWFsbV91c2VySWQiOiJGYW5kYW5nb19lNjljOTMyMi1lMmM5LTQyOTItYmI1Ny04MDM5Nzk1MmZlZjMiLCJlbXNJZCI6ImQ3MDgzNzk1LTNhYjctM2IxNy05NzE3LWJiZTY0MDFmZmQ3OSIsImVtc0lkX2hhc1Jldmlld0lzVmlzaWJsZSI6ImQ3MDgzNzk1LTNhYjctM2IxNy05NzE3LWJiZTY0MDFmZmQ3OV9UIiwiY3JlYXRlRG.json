It fed everyone's nostalgia and need for a satisfying resolution while also telling a new story. Yes, in hindsight it had faults, but there was no way that any movie could live up to all of the expectations of the thousands of fans that these movies have amassed over decades. It was however one last action-packed and emotional story for the characters and the beloved actors who brought them to life. 4.75/5 stars","displayName":"Stef B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:22:30.774Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:22:30.774Z","user":{"userId":"e07177cc-9686-4ef7-8a13-5537c15487ab","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Stef B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I really liked the movie. It summed everything up nicely in the time allowed. Wish it could have been 4 hours or split into two. There was a lot of story to tell. Hope it’s not the last one that will be really sad.
