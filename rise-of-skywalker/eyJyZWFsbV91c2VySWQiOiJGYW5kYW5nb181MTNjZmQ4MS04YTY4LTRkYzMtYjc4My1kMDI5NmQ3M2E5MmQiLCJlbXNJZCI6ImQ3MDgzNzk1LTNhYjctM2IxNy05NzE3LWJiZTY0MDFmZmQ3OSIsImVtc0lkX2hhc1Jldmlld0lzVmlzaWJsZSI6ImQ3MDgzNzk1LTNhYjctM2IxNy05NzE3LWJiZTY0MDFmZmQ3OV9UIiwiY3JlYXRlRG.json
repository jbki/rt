It is extremely fun without nitpicking it to death. It has some MAJOR pacing, plot, fan service issues, but the major arc of the franchise between Kylo Ren and Rey reaches a satisfying conclusion (with one small exception) in a pretty great final act...which is fun, but obviously as a Star Wars fan there was a lot to be desired in terms of storytelling logic and consistency.","displayName":"Mike E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2851164634946414/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:17:57.404Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:18:04.437Z","user":{"userId":"978480192","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike E","accountLink":"/user/id/978480192"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best Stars Wars ever!   As a young boy I saw the original in the theater in 1977 and feel episode 9 tied up the last trilogy very well and tugs at your emotions and nostalgia.

Abrams did a wonderful job of straightening out Rian Johnson's many many mistakes in The Last Jedi. What could have been had he not had to do that? This movie was so much fun and wonderfully paid service to fans. There were moments I laughed and a few where I couldn't help but cry (here's looking at you Chewie).
