Apparently anyone can have the force & anyone can be a force ghost. Completely goes against the history of Star Wars & the history behind the force. Storyline focused on the wrong character. Kylo Ren/Ben Solo deserved more. Too much of a political agenda. The ending truly destroyed the movie.","displayName":"Chelsea G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/671034530036717/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T05:26:40.288Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T05:26:47.790Z","user":{"userId":"978161768","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chelsea G","accountLink":"/user/id/978161768"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"}]}
