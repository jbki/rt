Other than Snoke and Luke passing, there is little need to see the movie. Luke was a redeemed character and the way he should have been in TLJ. This film was fun, emotional, energizing, and a fitting end to this chapter. Not perfect but, what movie is perfect these days. Great job!","displayName":"Jason P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10152862692138298/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T04:34:14.206Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T04:34:23.934Z","user":{"userId":"978472929","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jason P","accountLink":"/user/id/978472929"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My wife loved it and didnt like the two before this one.
