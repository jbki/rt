The pace was frenetic with high and low moments. \n\nHow do you satisfy fans by both honoring the past and present characters in one movie? In short, you can't. However, the Rise of Skywalker gives it an admirable try and will leave you entertained. \n\nThe final trilogy is a solid addition to the Star Wars universe, but Disney would be wise to follow the Kevin Feige Marvel model loosely planning out a storyline that connects while letting different directors create their own Star Wars movie.","displayName":"Garrett H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T18:54:20.556Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T18:54:20.556Z","user":{"userId":"978465997","realm":"RT","displayName":"Garrett H","accountLink":"/user/id/978465997"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"The Rise of Skywalker though a visual delight fails to deliver a epic conclusion of the trilogy with a rushed pacing and unusual plot choices.","displayName":"Kevin B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000485976592/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T18:53:46.537Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T18:53:49.549Z","user":{"userId":"907253074","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kevin B","accountLink":"/user/id/907253074"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The people hating on this are just jumping on a bandwagon with no real reason to hate on it.

Here it is. My review of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. It is not a must see. I wish it was otherwise, but there it is. It does tie up all the loose ends, but one. There are cameos all over the place and the dialog, at times, is hookie. A few feel good moments that you cheer for and a couple that you might cry over.\nIf you must see it in theaters because, like me you have seen them all in a theater at one time or another, there is No NEED to see it on opening weekend.\nHope this helps you plan your movie going plans.","displayName":"John","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T18:53:04.664Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T18:53:04.664Z","user":{"userId":"8d2da725-68c1-4a9a-ba19-ff8e17fe8915","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"John","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It wasnt anything special.
