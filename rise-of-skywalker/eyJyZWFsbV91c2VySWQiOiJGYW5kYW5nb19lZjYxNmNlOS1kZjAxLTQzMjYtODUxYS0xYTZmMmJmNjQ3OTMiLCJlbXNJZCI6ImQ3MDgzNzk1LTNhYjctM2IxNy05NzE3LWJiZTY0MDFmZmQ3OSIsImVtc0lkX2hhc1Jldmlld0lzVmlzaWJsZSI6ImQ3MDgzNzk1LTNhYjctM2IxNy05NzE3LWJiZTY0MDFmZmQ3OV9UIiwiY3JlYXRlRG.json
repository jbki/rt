It ties up all the loose ends from the past star wars movies. The acting was very well done. Is rey a nobody or was she a sith? grandaughter of the emperor. I grew up watching the star war movies and for me this was a natural conclusion to the series. It introduces a new heroine. I loved how(spoiler alert) princess leia aka carrie fisher , harrison ford and mark hamil all reprised their roles in the final movie.","displayName":"Wendy K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T00:56:43.303Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T00:56:43.303Z","user":{"userId":"712db58c-7170-4625-b1d0-65157260769c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Wendy K","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good Star Wars movie..all over the place trying to tie up loose ends from the last Jedi","displayName":"Delon H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T00:55:03.007Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T00:55:03.007Z","user":{"userId":"01D60852-75E7-4DA6-B33D-42E7B7D22A96","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Delon H","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was amazing!
