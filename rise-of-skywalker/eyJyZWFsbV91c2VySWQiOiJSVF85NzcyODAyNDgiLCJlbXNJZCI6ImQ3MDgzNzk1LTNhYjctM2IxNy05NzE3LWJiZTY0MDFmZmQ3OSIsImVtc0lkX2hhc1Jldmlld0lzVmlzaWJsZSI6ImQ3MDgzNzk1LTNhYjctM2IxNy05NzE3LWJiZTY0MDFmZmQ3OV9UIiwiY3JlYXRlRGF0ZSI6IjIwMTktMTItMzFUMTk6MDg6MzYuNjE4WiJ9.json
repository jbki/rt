I just couldn't get past the numerous issues present in this movie, including: \n\n- Characters of color were depicted with negative racial stereotypes. \n- Characters present in the last two movies were reduced to bit parts in favor of new characters or characters played by friends of JJ Abrams. \n- All the named female characters from TFA and TLJ were reduced to bit parts. \n- Few characters were given character arcs, and beloved characters were reduced to plot devices for other characters. \n- Characters depictions were both misogynistic and misandryist.\n- The plot was rushed to the point of being nonsensical. The movie was so jam-packed it was impossible to process anything before the next three things had happened. \n- The numerous plot holes distracted from the main story and contributed to the nonsensical plot. \n- The movie came off as if someone made a checklist of every complaint made by Reddit and Twitter, tried to fix them, and then filled in the plot around those fixes. \n- JJ Abrams claimed the movie had LGBT+ representation, which turned out to be a 2 second kiss that was easily glossed over. \n- Fanservice moments are forced into the plot in ways that neither advance the plot nor make sense. \n\nOverall it feels as if Abrams and Terrio were too busy fitting in new characters, planets, and fanservice moments to remember to write a story that makes sense for the characters they already have. While there are moments that are individually satisfying the end result is a wholly unsatisfying and disappointing end to the Skywalker saga.","displayName":"Ann F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T19:07:13.520Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:07:18.500Z","user":{"userId":"978454031","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ann F","accountLink":"/user/id/978454031"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved it.
