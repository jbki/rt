Itâ€™s sad that Disney was unable to create a cohesive overarching story line for the sequel trilogy as there are quite a few plot holes.

The movie is very nostalgia heavy and is a good farewell to the Skywalker saga.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:24:18.871Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:24:18.871Z","user":{"userId":"260343389","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260343389"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The conclusion of the Skywalker Saga is everything you want in a Star Wars movie: heart, action, fun, a bit of nostalgia, and all sorts of twists and turns.
