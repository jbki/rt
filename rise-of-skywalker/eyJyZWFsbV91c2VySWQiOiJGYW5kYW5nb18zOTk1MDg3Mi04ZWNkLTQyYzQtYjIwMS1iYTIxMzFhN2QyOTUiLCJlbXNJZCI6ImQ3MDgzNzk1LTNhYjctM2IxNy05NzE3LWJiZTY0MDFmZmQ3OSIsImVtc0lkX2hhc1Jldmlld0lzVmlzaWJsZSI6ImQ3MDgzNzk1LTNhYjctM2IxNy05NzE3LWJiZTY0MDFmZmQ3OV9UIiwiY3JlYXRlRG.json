Rights many of the wrongs of the Last Jedi, which is by far the worst film in the entire franchise (Holiday Special, Ewok movies and prequels included). It's a fun ride the whole way through.  Not without several \"Well how the hell did that happen?\" moments but, suspend disbelief and remember it's a Star Wars film and is a space fantasy film for the whole family with crazy creatures/aliens and locations where good is supposed to triumph over evil in a galaxy far, far, away as long as there is heart.  This film has heart and is a good sci-fi adventure which is all I wanted.  Left the theatre feeling good and not sick like I did with episode 8.  Best movie of this trilogy!","displayName":"Jason P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:25:25.647Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:25:40.897Z","user":{"userId":"842152571","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jason P","accountLink":"/user/id/842152571"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Predictable plotting and messy script erratic and frantic pacing.
