You can tell JJ was just checking the boxes of things the fans wanted, bad edits and rewrites in the movie. Canâ€™t believe they did Rian Johnson so dirty after how intellectual and character based his movie was. Overall this movie asked the fan to make assumptions and jump from A to Z with multiple aspects of the film.","displayName":"Matt","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T15:22:41.204Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T15:22:41.204Z","user":{"userId":"F9C7991C-F7BB-474D-802F-E8729932FCE4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Matt","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"13h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I am old enough and fortunate enough to have seen most of the Star Wars movies in the theatres.
