I've been a huge Star Wars fan since 1977. I didn't like The Force Awakens and I hated The Last Jedi with a passion. Going into the movie I really thought I was going to hate it. I expected The Holiday Special at best and the world's biggest nightmare before Christmas at worst. Although the movie did have a lot of problems, it exceeded my expectations.","displayName":"Jessica F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001671392522/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:42:39.276Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:43:18.195Z","user":{"userId":"959427933","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jessica F","accountLink":"/user/id/959427933"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"So the Skywalker saga ends with the Skywalker line completely destroyed, RoTJ's ending turned into a bad joke and Palpatine's decidedly Sith granddaughter stealing both the name and the home of Luke.\n\nThis is political, sick and gorss.

It was epic and everyone should see it at least once. JJ Abrams gave this saga the closure it needed. The only negatives I can think of would all be nitpicks. I cried, I laughed, I cheered, I was at the edge of my seat. I bet there are going to be people who say this movie is terrible. and I feel like either those people don't like to have fun or want to be very edgy and have a different opinion as others. I am excited to see where they take the main Star Wars story line next. This is coming from a HUGE Star Wars fan.","displayName":"A Fun and Epic movie!","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:41:58.131Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:41:58.131Z","user":{"userId":"701EE4BB-6A01-4C9B-B23F-4BA2D6AB7686","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"A Fun and Epic movie!","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie was utter garbage. The worst SW movie I've ever seen and one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only good part of the movie was Ben and Rey's dynamic and Ben Solo, but they did him so dirty in the most disrespectful manner possible to the entire skywalker family. Do not waste your money on this garbage. Donate your ticket money to AITAF (Adam Driver's nonprofit) instead. He basically held this trilogy on his shoulders. He was the only reason any part of this trilogy was worth watching, but most especially the last movie. If anything deserves your money, it's his cause. Not Disney.","displayName":"Victoria D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:41:57.666Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:42:31.406Z","user":{"userId":"978453437","realm":"RT","displayName":"Victoria D","accountLink":"/user/id/978453437"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"As a movie, it's rushed and sloppy. The characters are uninteresting and the script is near lifeless.\nAs a conclusion to the sequel trilogy, it's incoherent. If The Last Jedi ignored Chekhov's Gun, then this one shows what happens when that gun misfires. \nAs a conclusion to the Skywalker Saga, it's pointless. It's just the same ending as the last trilogy except with a worse script.\nIt was beautiful, but had nothing of substance. In fact, the break-neck pacing might give someone a headache.","displayName":"Ben W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:41:56.648Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:46:50.631Z","user":{"userId":"938428758","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ben W","accountLink":"/user/id/938428758"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Star wars movie i loved it brought a great end to the skywalker saga i'm looking forward to new star wars movies that may have rey in it","displayName":"Naweed R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2312487002323250/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:41:55.491Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:42:01.343Z","user":{"userId":"978453532","realm":"RT","displayName":"Naweed R","accountLink":"/user/id/978453532"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Once again critics get it wrong.
