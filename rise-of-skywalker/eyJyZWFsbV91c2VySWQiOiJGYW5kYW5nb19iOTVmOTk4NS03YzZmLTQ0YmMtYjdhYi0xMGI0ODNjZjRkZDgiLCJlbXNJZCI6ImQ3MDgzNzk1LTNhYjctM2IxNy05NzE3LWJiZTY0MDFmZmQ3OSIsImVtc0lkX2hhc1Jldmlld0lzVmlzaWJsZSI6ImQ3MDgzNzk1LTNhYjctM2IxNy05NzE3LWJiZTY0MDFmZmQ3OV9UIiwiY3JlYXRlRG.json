I personally wasn’t a fan of last Jedi and thought it went too far from the idea that the story is ultimately about the skywalkers so I was happy to have more attention on that. That brings me to the one thing I didn’t like- sorry I still think Rey should be a skywalker but did think the direction of her being a palpating worked and am overall ok with that. Overall it felt very nostalgic and was the campy adventure with interesting storylines and amazing special effects Star Wars is known for. It didn’t try to be anything else and anyone who expected otherwise needs to remember that is how the first three were. I enjoyed having lots of focus on Rey, Poe and Finn and enjoyed the arc for Kylo.
