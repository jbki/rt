I loved the movie, every part of this movie put me on different stages, tons of emotions, I laughed, I cried, I felt the sadness and the joy, there were a lot of crossed feelings for sure, but at the end took me were everything started and I felt the peace in my heart wondered what's next... for now I suggest patience masters and we'll see...

Pacing is off, the emotional notes are largely unearned. It answers long-standing questions unsatisfyingly, and then brings up new unsatisfying questions which it never bothers to answer. There are a couple of good action scenes, in a couple of really cool Concepts, but overall the plot is lazy. If I didn't know better I would think that JJ Abrams had never written a script before.","displayName":"Chris S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1477440485/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:12:35.166Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:12:42.526Z","user":{"userId":"794279029","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris S","accountLink":"/user/id/794279029"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Is better than The Last Jedi, but that's a very low bar.

Second act was good, a few weird decisions and a couple blatant plotholes. Third act started to look amazing, but then was completely undermined by the ending. The ending not only contradicted the previous films but contradicted itself moments before.","displayName":"Joel W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:12:18.849Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:12:26.064Z","user":{"userId":"976950720","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joel W","accountLink":"/user/id/976950720"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It tried to do the opposite of everything I hated from The Last Jedi, which was not focusing on old characters and plots, Rise Of Skywalker tried to connect the Original Trilogy and the prequels with the movie, and I loved that.","displayName":"Santiago V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10218555365187216/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:12:11.167Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:12:18.685Z","user":{"userId":"978454194","realm":"RT","displayName":"Santiago V","accountLink":"/user/id/978454194"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Star Wars!
