Paper thin plot. Way too many characters, including brand new characters, who are instantly forgettable. Awkward/shoddy inclusion of Leia. Would say the special effects make it worth seeing but not even fancy visuals save it. Watched the Return of the Jedi following this just to do a comparison, as it is generally considered the worst of the original three, and it's near Citizen Kane compared to the sophomoric effort seen here.","displayName":"P.
