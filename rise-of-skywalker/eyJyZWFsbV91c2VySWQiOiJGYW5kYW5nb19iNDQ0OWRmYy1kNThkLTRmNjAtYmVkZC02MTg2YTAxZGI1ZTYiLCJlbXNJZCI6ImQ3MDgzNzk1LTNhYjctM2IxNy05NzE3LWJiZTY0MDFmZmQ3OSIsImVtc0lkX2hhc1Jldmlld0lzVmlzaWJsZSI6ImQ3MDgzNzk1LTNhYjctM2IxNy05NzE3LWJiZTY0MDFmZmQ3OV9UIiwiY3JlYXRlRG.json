The speeches are hollow, the events are hollow, everything is hollow. I have a hard time understanding how or why people love this story so much.  The initial three movies, I can say how and why I love them.  These movies, they seem to be just moving on the inertia of love for the originals, along with some vague notion of \"passing down the torch.\"  The middle trilogy was not good, but at least they made sense, forming a cohesive whole.  These new movies just seem to liquidate memories into cash.  They do not make sense plot wise, they do not make sense in terms of keeping a coherence in ideas, they do not make sense in terms of the Star Wars universe, they simply do not make any kind of sense at all.","displayName":"Lion K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T23:17:16.481Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T23:17:59.732Z","user":{"userId":"977680347","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lion K","accountLink":"/user/id/977680347"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I just loved every second of this film!

I would say JJ Abrams did probably his best work considering he had to clean up the disasters from the last move.  I am a hardcore Star Wars fan and felt like this movie closed out this 40+ year story successfully and will go down as one of the better Star Wars in the series.  PLEASE DON'T LISTEN TO THE CRITICS AND GO SEE IT.    I was expecting the worse after the last movie and Abrams and the entire cast delivered.
