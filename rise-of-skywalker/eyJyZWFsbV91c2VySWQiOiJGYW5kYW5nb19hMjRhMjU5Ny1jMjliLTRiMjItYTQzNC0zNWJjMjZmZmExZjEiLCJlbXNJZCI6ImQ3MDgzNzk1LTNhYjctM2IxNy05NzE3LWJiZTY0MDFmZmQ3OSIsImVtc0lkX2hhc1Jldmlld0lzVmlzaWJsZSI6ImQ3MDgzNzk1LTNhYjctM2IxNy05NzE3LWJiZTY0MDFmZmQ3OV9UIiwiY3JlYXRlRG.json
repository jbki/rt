The story was still badly written and the acting was subpar. However it did have to  follow up on an even worse film, The Last Jedi, and it certainly gave it a good shot at trying to fix the problems that the previous instalment created. It was entertaining enough that I'd recommend seeing the film but I don't think it's good enough to deserve your money. If your gonna see it you should wait till it's cheaper to view.","displayName":"Keir C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T20:06:03.165Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T20:06:12.945Z","user":{"userId":"977400381","realm":"RT","displayName":"Keir C","accountLink":"/user/id/977400381"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a Force-fed fan-feast, stuffed with all the fixins and presented on a silver platter. This final chapter surprised and engaged me with it’s nostalgic character moments and frenetic action. Although often preoccupied with retconning much of the previous film, it delivers the goods, while answering some questions along the way. Abrams had quite the turkey to carve. However he succeeds at resolving this 43 year old journey, through charming the audience with respect for the material. Although a messy film, for the most part it’s incredibly satisfying and delicious to devour. I probably ate WAY too much, but it doesn’t matter. It’s a tasty bird, and am going back for seconds. 8/10 ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T20:04:53.315Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T20:04:53.315Z","user":{"userId":"901127406","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/901127406"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great ending to this series’s","displayName":"Steve","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T20:02:43.208Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T20:02:43.208Z","user":{"userId":"03CBA96B-94D7-486C-A784-138D94E5E773","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Steve","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great movie a must see","displayName":"Jesus C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T19:59:30.216Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:59:30.216Z","user":{"userId":"A112779B-C9A8-4A4D-A136-FDDB0EB979BB","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jesus C","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Disney had a pretty easy job when it bought Lucas Films.  All they had to do was to tell a decent original story in the Star Wars world set up by Lucas.  But rather then using the same world and changing the story, Disney chose to tell the same story and change the world.  The result is both predictable and incoherent.  It's predictable in the sense that the viewer is left feeling as though he or she is watching the same story that Lucas told 40 years ago.  And it's incoherent in the sense that the new elements of the story don't fit within the world of Star Wars.  Disney makes no attempt to explain how these new elements fit or even to make the new trilogy's world internally consistent.  Abrams also made no attempt to incorporate any of the story elements that Johnson introduced in The Last Jedi, but overall it was probably a good decision not to try to polish that turd.","displayName":"Joe M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/12318791/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-31T19:55:10.959Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:55:34.239Z","user":{"userId":"835358956","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joe M","accountLink":"/user/id/835358956"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Love the old school story integrated into the new.the original story and characters is what made it great\nnot the new characters. let's make Star Wars Great Again.","displayName":"Donald M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T19:55:02.240Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:59:09.424Z","user":{"userId":"C06CF882-8ADC-404E-927F-0A0F96050270","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Donald M","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"They did the best they could after episode 8 provided nothing.
