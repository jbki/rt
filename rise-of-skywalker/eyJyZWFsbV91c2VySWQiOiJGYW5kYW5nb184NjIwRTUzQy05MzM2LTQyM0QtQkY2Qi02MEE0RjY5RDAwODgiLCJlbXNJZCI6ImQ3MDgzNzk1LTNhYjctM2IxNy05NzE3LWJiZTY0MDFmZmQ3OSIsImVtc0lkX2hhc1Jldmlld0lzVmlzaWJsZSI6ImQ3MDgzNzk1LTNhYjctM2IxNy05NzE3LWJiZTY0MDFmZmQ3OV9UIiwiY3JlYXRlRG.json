Because this movie was terrible!  The premise involving Palpatine being alive was absurd and lazy.  The plot was boring and overcrowded.  The bulk of the screen time was devoted to boring video-game fetch quests.  Characters and plot points were introduced in one scene and either trivially resolved or lazily ignored within minutes.  There were so many plot holes and instances of sloppy, lazy writing.  The characters and themes were often very inconsistent, both within this movie and in relation to the two that came before this one.  Any creative assets that hadn't already been squandered in the first two movies were squandered in this one.  There were no consequences for mistakes.  Deaths and other disasters were reversed multiple times.  Do I really need to go on?  This is just such a blatantly bad movie.  Disney had no plan for this trilogy and in terms of quality, it backfired completely.","displayName":"Mike M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T08:17:00.824Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T08:17:53.774Z","user":{"userId":"901286607","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike M","accountLink":"/user/id/901286607"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great plot, action and tie together the story of past lineages","displayName":"William cullen","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T08:07:45.727Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T08:07:45.727Z","user":{"userId":"43c7b4ee-a8e7-4365-93f2-fb82889c28bf","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"William cullen","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Typical Star Wars formula, gives you what you want if you are a fan and on a grand scale.","displayName":"Gregory B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T08:06:32.299Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T08:06:32.299Z","user":{"userId":"8F0F419A-827D-4257-9A06-37E1ED0D4E00","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Gregory B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The force pulled me out of my seat","displayName":"Cottrell","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T07:54:32.166Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T07:54:32.166Z","user":{"userId":"2600ED3B-5B1E-4038-BD9C-85A4E0E45741","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Cottrell","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"JJ did the best he could with the garbage left over by Rian Johnson, much much much better than TLJ.","displayName":"David R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/614160540/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T07:53:29.117Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T07:53:32.408Z","user":{"userId":"857902063","realm":"RT","displayName":"David R","accountLink":"/user/id/857902063"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was amazing seeing the characters we have grown up with and love, at the end of their story.
