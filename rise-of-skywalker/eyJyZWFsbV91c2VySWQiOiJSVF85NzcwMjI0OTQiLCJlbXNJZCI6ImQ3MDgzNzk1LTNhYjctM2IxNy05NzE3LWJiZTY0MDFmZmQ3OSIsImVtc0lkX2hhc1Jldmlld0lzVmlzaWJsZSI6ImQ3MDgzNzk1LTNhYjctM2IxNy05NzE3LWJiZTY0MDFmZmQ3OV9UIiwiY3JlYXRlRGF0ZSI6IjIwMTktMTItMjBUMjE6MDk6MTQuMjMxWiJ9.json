Somewhat chaotic, covering a lot of 30yr backstory shortly but providing a clear arcs for our new characters to grow.  As part of the whole Skywalker Universe: It is sad that 3 movies worth of arc was shoved into a single movie but I think that lies at the feet of JJ Abrams.  Going back and watching Episode VIII after time had passed, it became clearer that the goal of VIII was to strip the mythos/legends of the Jedi from their true purpose as they pertain to the Force. This paves the way for Ben and Rey to demonstrate what a true Jedi's role is.  Since the message was somewhat lost in translation between VIII & IX, IX suffered from having to clarify Luke's life lessons.  All in all, a solid ending assuming Disney doesn't get so greedy that they try and resurrect the bloodline from Ben and Rey's last scene.","displayName":"Timne B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10130915/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:09:13.118Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:09:20.457Z","user":{"userId":"912325506","realm":"RT","displayName":"Timne B","accountLink":"/user/id/912325506"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great close to the saga.
