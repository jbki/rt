I really can’t understand the negativity directed at this film. It was a lot of fun from beginning to end. This film is packed with humor, action, adventure, drama, and tons of Star Wars callbacks. It’s not heavy handed in any respect. Just pure joy and awe... This film made me feel like a kid again. I felt privileged to share the theatre with a diverse audience representing a wide range of ages. The children were left smiling ear-to-ear. The professional critics are way off on this one.

I wasn't expecting that. I really enjoyed the movie. It's super super fast paced, they crammed a lot of story into 2.5 hours. So be ready to hit the ground running because once the movie starts it doesn't slow down until it's over. \n\nThe best part I thought was the story. Shit made sense and didn't seem \"forced\" like in TLJ. Glad Poe got more story time and actually developed more. Even the Finn / Rose dynamic is now more palatable and not just in your face. \n\nThe saddest part I think that might turn people off is the pacing. Because SO MUCH happens so quickly, they could have easily gone to a three hour running time. And I think the biggest problem people will have is just the sheer volume of information crammed into the 2.5 hours. There's a lot to unpack. \n\nIt's clear Abrams wanted this story spread out among three movies. With that being said, I think it's a solid Star Wars movie. I'm not sure yet where it ranks with the others yet. Have to watch it a few more times before I make that call. \n\nLots of fan service though and I'm perfectly okay with that. \n\nGo see the movie! It's the last big Star Wars movie we are gonna get for a few years.","displayName":"Thomas F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/500500725/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:43:37.901Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:43:42.084Z","user":{"userId":"949776354","realm":"RT","displayName":"Thomas F","accountLink":"/user/id/949776354"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"La pelicula tiene un desarrollo pesimo, con un bombardeo de informacion justificado en conveniencia del guion y ocurrencias de las cosas porque si.
