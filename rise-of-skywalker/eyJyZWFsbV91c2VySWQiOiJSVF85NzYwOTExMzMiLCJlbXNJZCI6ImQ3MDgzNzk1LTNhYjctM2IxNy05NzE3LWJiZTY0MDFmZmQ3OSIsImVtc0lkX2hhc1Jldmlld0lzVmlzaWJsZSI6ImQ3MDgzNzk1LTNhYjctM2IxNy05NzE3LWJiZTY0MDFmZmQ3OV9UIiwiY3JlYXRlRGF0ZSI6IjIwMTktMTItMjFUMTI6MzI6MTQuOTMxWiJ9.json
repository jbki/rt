The effects and music were phenomenal, but the story and script were awful.  The many intense moments had no build up to them so you didn't care about them.  There were many last minute saves where some cheap, easy, and quick solution was used, or some outside force came in to save.  The script was so simplistic it could have been written by an 8 year old and had a LOT of \"you can do it\"  type speeches.   The movie was garbage, better than Last Jedi but still garbage.","displayName":"Philip D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T08:59:19.088Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:04:36.274Z","user":{"userId":"976750620","realm":"RT","displayName":"Philip D","accountLink":"/user/id/976750620"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Ok movie.. kind of a sad way to end the story!","displayName":"Robin R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T08:37:09.078Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T01:39:53.165Z","user":{"userId":"7245A9BB-048D-484D-8F1A-0F24115DA78E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Robin R","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"}]}
