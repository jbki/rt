And there were robots made of balls and robots with only one wheel.  There were many, MANY extra-large guns, and goofy looking aliens scattered about like it ain't no thing. The baddies lost and the goodies won, which was especially nice as it certainly looked like the mouldy old man had it in the bag at one point. There were bigger waves than I've ever seen, which was enjoyable, especially when two people chose that spot for a fight made of fire-swords! One spaceship landed actually on fire and they all got out and had bants about it, while very many others burned in sadder ways, especially the one the monkey was on.  But then he wasn't so that turned out ace! I thought all the lead characters were great folks, just the kind of people I'd like to hang out with, except for that they would probably get me killed.  If you like all these things you will love this film.  I did.","displayName":"Joseph C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/705592345/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:59:56.734Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:00:05.098Z","user":{"userId":"952664709","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph C","accountLink":"/user/id/952664709"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I was 14 when the first Star Wars movie was released.

I walked out of the theater rather impressed at how they were able to save beloved characters, add in cool force powers, and actually pulled off a decent ending.","displayName":"Max","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:59:39.454Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:59:39.454Z","user":{"userId":"5e90fd3d-9242-4829-8ebe-62226473bade","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Max","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a great end to the Star Wars saga","displayName":"Jeffrey N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:59:27.707Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:59:27.707Z","user":{"userId":"47388CEC-49C1-4D19-A397-399B36775546","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jeffrey N","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"ok not great though better than last jedi but pails in comparison","displayName":"c m","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:59:22.423Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:59:40.469Z","user":{"userId":"976291109","realm":"RT","displayName":"c m","accountLink":"/user/id/976291109"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"much better than the last movie but lacked emotional connections.","displayName":"tb","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:59:10.271Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:59:10.271Z","user":{"userId":"0a5cd1d0-0978-481c-8766-59c6ead7fb55","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"tb","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I thought it was good, not great like several of the other Star Wars movies.","displayName":"Scott","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:58:55.308Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:58:55.308Z","user":{"userId":"8e4e8ba1-0b6f-4014-9122-29df1ba664c4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Scott","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Star Wars movie of my lifetime, born in '85.\nRogue One was good but an add on to the 9 movie sequence. \nThis movie is the payoff we were all hoping for.","displayName":"Eric B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000103635469/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:58:39.040Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:58:46.364Z","user":{"userId":"952221983","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eric B","accountLink":"/user/id/952221983"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"}]}
