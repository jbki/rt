It is incredible. I don't think it is ret-con(ing?) at all, in fact, I spent much of the last two years (until I had to stop because I couldn't take the negativity from the loudest of the haters) trying to explain how I felt that they planned all of this more than they let on, and how it was all going to play out. It seemed clear to me, and I believe if you gave truth serum to JJ and Rian, they would probably tell you that they had a plan from the beginning (maybe Colin wasn't on board and that's why he had to go?). Regardless, if you love Star Wars and don't get your jollies from being a contrarian or at least insist on going into this film with a pessimistic attitude, then I think there is a pretty good chance that you will really love this movie. I know I did. I'm going to miss SW during this hiatus, and I hope the plan is to make a lot more movies and TV series very soon.","displayName":"Jeff G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T20:50:12.476Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T20:50:19.335Z","user":{"userId":"662103966","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeff G","accountLink":"/user/id/662103966"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing and fulfilling conclusion to the saga","displayName":"William B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T20:49:58.981Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T20:49:58.981Z","user":{"userId":"109D9CCD-F5B2-4A78-8339-89C8D0136E6B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"William B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely an amazing ride worth the IMAX ticket price.","displayName":"Mary","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T20:48:54.311Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T20:48:54.311Z","user":{"userId":"B612C6E6-C9D3-45F2-AA83-1822264B09D2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mary","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It made up for the error that was The Last Jedi.
