It was like watching a blend of Star Wars and  Frozen. Rushed plot with characters I couldn't  care less about. Movie tried hard to make amends for TLJ in my opinion and I thank them for there efforts in that regard. Cannot pmease everyone and sadly I was one of them. I really wanted this to be great but it was average at best.","displayName":"David W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10220544915521224/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T05:57:26.785Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T05:57:47.407Z","user":{"userId":"978479085","realm":"RT","displayName":"David W","accountLink":"/user/id/978479085"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was a better tie in to end the Skywalker story.","displayName":"CHANS R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T05:55:41.296Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T05:55:41.296Z","user":{"userId":"3C090A64-DB32-48F0-805C-417C58FC1413","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"CHANS R","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"i thought it was fine, what the hell else was they supposed to do after TLJ??
