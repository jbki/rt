But this film might change you opinion on the other films, or atleast be a way better one than the others.\n\nThis movie did almost everything right by my book. It corrected or explained things that felt off or unexplainable in the previous installments(especially The Last Jedi). The problems I had with most characters turned out to be a part of the bigger story, and those who I previously thought were dull suddenly became alot more interesting.  Now that I look back at the other films in trilogy, they make much more sense.\n\nStar Wars to me has always been about the epic battle between the light and the mystericlaland uncomprehensibly wicked dark side, with incredibly high stakes. The mystery behind the dark side has always been something I've been facinated by in the franchise(which is mostly explored in Revenge of the sith, which is why it is my absolute favourite of the films). This is what I've felt like the latest installments has been missing, but not anymore. \n\nSo why didn't I give it a 5/5 star review then? Well, my big problem with this movie is essentially not this movie in itself, but rather the other two that did kind of a poor job at building everything up untill the end.","displayName":"Sammy F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:02:30.084Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:02:42.699Z","user":{"userId":"976409917","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sammy F","accountLink":"/user/id/976409917"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"story felt lazy and overly long scenes gave me too much time to think about all the plot holes.  some elements seemed created solely to allow for later moments and it was hard to ignore how contrived the gimmick felt.  liked the stunts, funnier than previous installments and grateful other characters were allowed more screne time as it made up for the lack of skill in others who were dominant in the past.","displayName":"Erin O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:02:28.928Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:02:28.928Z","user":{"userId":"54780B0A-0420-4023-9BE3-B3CEFDF556A8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Erin O","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
