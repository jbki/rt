Characters were developed well and had sufficient wrap up to call it a final. Felt rushed and felt like 3 movies into 1, not the fault of this move merely the fault of 8 in my opinion. Further plot development needed in 8 to really give a finally the final goodbye it needed in 9. Snoke being killed was a major flaw in the last Jedi and thus Palatine needs to fill the roll which should have been filled by Snoke.","displayName":"adam b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:40:05.517Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:40:05.517Z","user":{"userId":"978441952","realm":"RT","displayName":"adam b","accountLink":"/user/id/978441952"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"It really is not the end this saga deserves.

Emotive scenes that brought a tear to my eye, with plenty of plot twists and surprises. There is a lot crammed into the film and I feel like some of this could and should have been fleshed out in TLJ. BUT I suppose you feel like you're going along on the ride as a result. There wasn't a scene that I didn't enjoy unlike TLJ and so I look forward to seeing this again.

True fans of Star Wars that can see past the out-of-touch critics will likely find things to both enjoy and hate, but this will just add to the hours of debating us Star Wars fanboys love to have with ourselves.
