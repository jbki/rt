It offers all the fan service that was demanded and the result is a predictable and plot-hole filled mess.\nThis film is enjoyable if you can shut off your brain and enjoy it like a fast and furious style movie, or if nostalgia is more appealing than good storytelling.","displayName":"Michael R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T09:54:44.367Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T09:54:50.109Z","user":{"userId":"969820932","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael R","accountLink":"/user/id/969820932"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The movie was really great until the end!
