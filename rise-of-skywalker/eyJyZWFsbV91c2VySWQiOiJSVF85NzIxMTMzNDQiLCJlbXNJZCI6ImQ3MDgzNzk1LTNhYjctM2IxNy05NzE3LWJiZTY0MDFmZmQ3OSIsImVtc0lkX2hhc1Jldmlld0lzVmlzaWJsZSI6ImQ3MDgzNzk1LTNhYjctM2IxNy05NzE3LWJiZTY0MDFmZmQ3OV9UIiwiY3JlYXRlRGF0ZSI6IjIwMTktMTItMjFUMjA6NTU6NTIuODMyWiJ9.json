It gives you whiplash jumping from scene to scene. Its character development is both forced and rushed. No doubt to cover the lack of development from the past 2 movies. It is better than The Last Jedi but that doesn't say much. Don't waste your time or money.","displayName":"Brandon B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:54:45.146Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:54:47.332Z","user":{"userId":"978461006","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brandon B","accountLink":"/user/id/978461006"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I like the movie , but if this is the last of all STAR WAR , I wanted something new I didn't know before .","displayName":"ken k","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:54:37.578Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:54:37.578Z","user":{"userId":"20460fb7-2952-43d7-bf1e-3e8e3db5b4e0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"ken k","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"It felt cheap and contrived, itâ€™s like they completely tried to erase the last movie ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:54:21.068Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:54:21.068Z","user":{"userId":"931976014","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/931976014"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"}]}
