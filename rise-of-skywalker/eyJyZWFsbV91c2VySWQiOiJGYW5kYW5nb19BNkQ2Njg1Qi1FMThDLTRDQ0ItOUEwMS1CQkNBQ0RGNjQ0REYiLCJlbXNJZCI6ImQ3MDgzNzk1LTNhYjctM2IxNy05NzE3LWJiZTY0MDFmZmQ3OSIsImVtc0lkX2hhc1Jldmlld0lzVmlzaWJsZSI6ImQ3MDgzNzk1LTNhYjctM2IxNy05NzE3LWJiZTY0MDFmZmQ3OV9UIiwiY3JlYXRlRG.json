The characters have way to much power and seem more like gods than Jedi. In my opinion, they've destroyed the whole star wars series with this movie, but the acting was good and I'm sure the younger kids who haven't seen all the movies would enjoy this. I literally felt a sick feeling while watching this movie.","displayName":"Blake B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:56:09.087Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:56:09.087Z","user":{"userId":"978471002","realm":"RT","displayName":"Blake B","accountLink":"/user/id/978471002"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I am mixed about this new trilogy.  I liked this movie a hell of a lot better than \"the last  jedi\", which to me is the worst one in all 9 movies. this trilogy did not get me to like the characters as much as the other 2 trilogies.  Yes the prequels acting SUCKED, but it was the story and the characters I loved, along with the action and special effects.  I really didnt care to much in the Rey/Finn/Poe characters, they jsut didnt grab me like Ahn/Luke/Leia and Anakin/Kenobi/Padme did.  again, yes the acting was poor in the prequels!  there were things loved in the new trilogy but ALOT of bad.  I loved seeing Han/Leia/Luke again (CHEWIE!! and Lando!!) But to me the new triology seemed more like Star Trek scifi!  The Aliens and planets just seemed like Star Trekkie!  No thought behind their creation!  Lucas had an imagination and also the old school props dept!  I was soooo excited to see Force Awakens but sort of disappointed, last jedi was a total let down and this one I really didnt care.  I waited to see if until today!! From ROTJ to TFA I was their the first night, the Last Jedi I saw the next day but was in Japan at the time.   JUst not thrilled about it anymore.  I still watch the original religiously!  The prequels once in awhile but the new ones (TFA and TLJ hardly ever!  I quess I am getting old!! I was 4 yrs old when the first (Episode 4) one came out!! \nBut, I did love Rogue One (alittle slow but great) Solo was OK (woody harrleson jsut didnt fit the part to me! he will always be WOODY!).  But I do like the Mandalorian!
