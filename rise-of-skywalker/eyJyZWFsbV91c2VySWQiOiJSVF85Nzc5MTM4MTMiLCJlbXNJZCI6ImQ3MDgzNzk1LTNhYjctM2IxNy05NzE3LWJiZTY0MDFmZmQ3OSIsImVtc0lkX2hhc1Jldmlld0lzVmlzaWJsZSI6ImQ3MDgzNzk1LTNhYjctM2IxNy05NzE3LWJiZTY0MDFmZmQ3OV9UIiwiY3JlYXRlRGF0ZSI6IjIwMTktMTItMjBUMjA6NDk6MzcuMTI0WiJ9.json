No, it is not a great movie, but I found it to be a worthy and entertaining Star Wars movie. I saw the originals as a kid when I had an ability to overlook the fact that a band of rebels could really overcome an empire. Star Wars has always been about escapism, letting go, and enjoying a story of hope - a story that borders on impossible. For me, the Rise of Skywalker still captured that feeling. This movie absolutely could have been much better if it didn't have to course correct for The Last Jedi and try and squeeze too much into one film. Rian Johnson makes good films... I just don't think his Last Jedi Star Wars story fit the narrative for the Skywalker saga. I am happy with what JJ Abrams was able to put together considering what he had to work with.","displayName":"Michael M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:48:43.394Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:49:09.775Z","user":{"userId":"901119076","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael M","accountLink":"/user/id/901119076"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"coming off of the mistakes TLJ director, this one left some plot holes. but the TROS delivered bug beautiful action.","displayName":"yapette c","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:48:42.249Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:48:42.249Z","user":{"userId":"B5316CCF-AEC6-4F48-8E0C-AFC25EC25097","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"yapette c","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's a great celebration of everything we love about Star Wars.

It did have its flaws, as it felt a little rushed most of the time and did not have many surprises. However, Abrams did the best he could in an attempt to recover the trilogy from the Last Jedi. The battle sequences which filled a majority of the movie looked incredible. Overall, a great movie and a must see for all Star Wars fans.","displayName":"towvader77","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:48:28.284Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:48:28.284Z","user":{"userId":"0E3B3568-8125-4645-AD07-D0891695D72A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"towvader77","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
