Abrams tries to pack so much action into the movie that you dont realize that the story is poorly written and riddled with plot holes. The characters are the same bland, vacuous personalities that no one cares about, although there is some attempt at something resembling character development. One of the worst things that this film and trilogy does is ignore the rules and parameters of the universe in which they are operating. Making up or changing rules from previously established material is the ultimate characteristic of bad storytelling, showing either a laziness to review the source material or a blatant disregard for the source material. Disney seems to think that they can just keep pumping out crappy films and slapping the Star Wars name on them while putting in minimal effort so that they can make as much money as possible. I, for one, disregard completely 7, 8, & 9. Theyre not Star Wars films theyre an easy cash grab for a corporation that has zero creativity or respect for the Star Wars universe. Congratulations Disney Star Wars, you will be remembered as an embarrassing failure â€” the product of a greedy & lazy company run by a bunch of cinematic hacks.","displayName":"Tim","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T15:46:16.501Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T15:46:16.501Z","user":{"userId":"cd9395cd-9c03-45f3-b486-62c4708079fc","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tim","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Awful.

There's too many convenient plot points, massive plot holes, lazy story telling, and eye-rolling cringe-worthy moments. It retcons most of the Last Jedi which I don't mind; but it's execution is poor with a lot of the story beats very predictable. There are entire scenes which are copied from the original trilogy. They clearly did not have a plan for this new sequel trilogy and it's obvious. Watching the sequel trilogy is very jarring; its evident that JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson had very different ideas in mind. \n\nThere are positives - the visual effects, action and score by John Williams are excellent and have been consistently good throughout this new trilogy. The acting is solid across the board. Unfortunately, Rise of Skywalker ends this new sequel trilogy with a sputter rather than a triumph.","displayName":"Justin J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/747315560/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T15:44:50.688Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T15:44:57.324Z","user":{"userId":"859987258","realm":"RT","displayName":"Justin J","accountLink":"/user/id/859987258"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It may have been my favorite Star Wars movie!

The later portion dealing with the relationship of the Emperor, Rey and Kylo was a plodding mess that took me out of the film to look at my watch. The colloquial expressions of the Storm Troopers, also took me out of the film. If you turn of your cynicism off, there are some good pieces.  I think it was better than Last Jedi from tone to the \"humor.\" But, if you think about what is going on, you realize that the story doesn't really make much sense.   I felt that they were jamming as much as possible into the film to just wrap it up,   The redemption of Kylo Ren/Ben Solo was the strongest part of the film -- the rest was just loud noises.","displayName":"Matthew R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T15:41:10.896Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T15:41:14.571Z","user":{"userId":"977748348","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew R","accountLink":"/user/id/977748348"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A great end to the sequels.
