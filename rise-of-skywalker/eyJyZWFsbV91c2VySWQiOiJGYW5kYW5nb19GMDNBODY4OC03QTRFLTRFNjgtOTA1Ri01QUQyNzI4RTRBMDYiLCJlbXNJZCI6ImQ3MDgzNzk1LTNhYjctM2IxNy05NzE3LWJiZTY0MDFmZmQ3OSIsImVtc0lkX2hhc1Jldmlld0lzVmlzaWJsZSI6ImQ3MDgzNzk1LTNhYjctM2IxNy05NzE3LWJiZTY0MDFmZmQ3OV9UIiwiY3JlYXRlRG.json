I felt like I was watching a Disney cartoon made for kids. I've seen porn with better plot. For me, these last 3 movies don't exist in parallel with the originals and the prequels. Deep down I think of them as a separate trio outside of the original universe. This movie in particular destroyed the whole idealogy and beliefs of the first 6. It opens so many plot holes that I can't even list them all. Spoilers from this point on. Don't read if you haven't seen the movie. You were warned. Bringing back Palpatin (aka recycled material) defeats the whole point of Anakin being the chosen one who was supposed to bring balance to the galaxy. Then making Palpatin a representation of all evil by saying he has all the Siths inside him to then be killed by Rey is saying that we killed all the evil there was so now it's only the good guys left. And on this note we can end the trilogy and won't be making star wars movies anymore. That again goes against the whole idealogy of having balance in the force (yin and yang). The balance means having both good and evil. You can't kill 'all the siths' and say we brought balance to the galaxy. This move in particular gets 1.5/10. The whole trilogy is at 3/10. I can see how people will rate this above 5/10 if they haven't seen or been interested in the old materials.","displayName":"Areg M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:50:39.133Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:50:39.133Z","user":{"userId":"B9502BDB-CC1E-4BAF-BF4C-7504D1BEE559","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Areg M","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"By far the best of the sequel trilogy!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:50:32.467Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:50:32.467Z","user":{"userId":"260002179","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260002179"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Best Star Wars of the Saga by far.
