Bringing back Palpatine shows that there was no real narrative thread through this trilogy.  I think that the acting was overall fairly strong, although as a character Rey remained extremely overpowered (she took no fight damage the entire trilogy) and Kylo's story arc conclusion was predictable.  If you are a Star Wars fan than this is basically required viewing, but it doesn't break any new ground.","displayName":"William S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T18:48:22.869Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T18:48:25.612Z","user":{"userId":"976870191","realm":"RT","displayName":"William S","accountLink":"/user/id/976870191"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Overall the movie was forgetable.
