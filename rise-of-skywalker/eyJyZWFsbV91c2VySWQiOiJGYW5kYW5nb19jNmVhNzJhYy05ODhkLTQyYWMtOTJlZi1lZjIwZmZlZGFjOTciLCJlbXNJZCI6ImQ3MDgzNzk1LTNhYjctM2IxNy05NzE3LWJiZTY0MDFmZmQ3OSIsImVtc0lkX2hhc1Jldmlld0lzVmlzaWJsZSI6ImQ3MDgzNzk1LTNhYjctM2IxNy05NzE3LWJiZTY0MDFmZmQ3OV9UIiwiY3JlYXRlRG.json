Despite the somewhat large amount of flaws and issues, I can say that unless you are are a hardcore Star Wars fan, you will enjoy this movie. This does not come from the perspective of lore, as all the Dark Empire references are a treat, but just the fact is that this film doesn't feel like Star Wars. The pacing is strange, and honestly the storyline featured here could have easily been 1 or 2 seasons of a show, or even its own trilogy. I would rank it as my personal 4th favorite car wars movie, but I don't think it deserves its audience rating.","displayName":"CJ F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/447750122810473/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T14:26:43.078Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T14:26:50.043Z","user":{"userId":"978500639","realm":"RT","displayName":"CJ F","accountLink":"/user/id/978500639"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"14h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"No real satisfying resolutions.
