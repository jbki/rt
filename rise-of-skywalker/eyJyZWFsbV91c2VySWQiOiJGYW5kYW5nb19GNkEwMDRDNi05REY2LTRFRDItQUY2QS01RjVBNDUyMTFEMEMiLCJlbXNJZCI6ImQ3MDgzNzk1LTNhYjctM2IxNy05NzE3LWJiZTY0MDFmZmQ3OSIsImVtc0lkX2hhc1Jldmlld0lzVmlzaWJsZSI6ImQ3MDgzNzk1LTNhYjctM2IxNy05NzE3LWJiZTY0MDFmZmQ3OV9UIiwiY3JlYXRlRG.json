It was a great return to the type of storytelling in The Force Awakens, with much better character direction. But, I think Last Jedi just did too much damage to the story arc and they had to wrap it up the best they could. Overall this is the 2nd best movie in this new trilogy, with Force Awakens first.","displayName":"Shawn D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T23:55:28.562Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T23:55:28.562Z","user":{"userId":"0DED3216-0305-4585-9081-96633A370A4E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Shawn D","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Not a huge fan of star wars in general.
