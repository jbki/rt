Star Wars was always about hope--and the ending left me hollow and crying for days. The backtracking done was terrible -- I personally LOVED that Rey was a Nobody -- it shows that you don't have to come from a famous bloodline/dynasty to be special, to have the Force, to be somebody. The fact that that entire point was reversed was extremely disheartening and disappointing. The directionless plot was abysmal, the treatment of Rose appalling, and there was literally NO reason to kill off Ben Solo -- someone who had suffered his entire life with Snoke/Palpatine in his head and traumatized by once waking up to his uncle literally contemplating killing him. He was given a moment of happiness before his death. Children were sobbing in the theater. Five days before Christmas. Thanks, JJ.","displayName":"Nicole K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:44:31.089Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:44:31.089Z","user":{"userId":"978471184","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nicole K","accountLink":"/user/id/978471184"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"}]}
