As a stand alone film it might be watchable. As a  deep Star Wars fan you can't help but see all the inconsistencies and lack of mythos in a story that had so much of that previously. Truly this is a reflection of how Hollywood for the sake of money believed they needed to just red create ROTJ, because I guess that's what fans wanted and got people in seats, the conclusion of this saga is so hopeless for our main characters, that it almost makes me wish this sequel trilogy was never made, but we did get on of the best characters in Star Wars history. Only for him to have the same fate as Vader... personally it was quite a disappointment.","displayName":"Melissa R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:06:50.168Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:06:50.971Z","user":{"userId":"978466089","realm":"RT","displayName":"Melissa R","accountLink":"/user/id/978466089"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved loved loved it!
