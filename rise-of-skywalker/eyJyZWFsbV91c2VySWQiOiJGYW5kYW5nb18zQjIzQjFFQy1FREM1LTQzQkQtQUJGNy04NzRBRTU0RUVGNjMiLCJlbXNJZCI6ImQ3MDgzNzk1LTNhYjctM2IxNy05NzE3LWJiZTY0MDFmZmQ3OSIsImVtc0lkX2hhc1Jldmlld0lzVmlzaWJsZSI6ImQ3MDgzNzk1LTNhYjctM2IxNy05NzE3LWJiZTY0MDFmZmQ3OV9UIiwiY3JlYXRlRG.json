And no, I'm not blaming the fans for the terrible fan se give, this is and has always been on Disney.i feel terrible for those who thought they were going to be a part of something amazing to only realize they were duped into putting their faces on 3 of the most horrifyingly terrible big production movies out there.

This was a satisfying end to the Skywalker saga. True, much more could’ve been done, but the main key element for this film (Carrie Fisher), had passed so there were only so many avenues available to wrap this story and pay homage to Leia Organa simultaneously. I applaud JJ Abrams for his delicate handling of this unplanned for tragedy. Ultimately, (IMO), the true story of this saga was always about faith and hope for a better tomorrow against all odds, and that’s exactly what I felt after the end of this film.","displayName":"Tony R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T10:49:56.136Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T10:49:56.136Z","user":{"userId":"04E853F7-FC69-44C1-8E27-8E90698849A8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tony R","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"It's a movie but not a star wars movie.
