Story veers about haphazardly. Characters seem to have lost what development they had from the previous two movies. Writers appear unable to imagine greater stakes than what was already beaten three movies ago. Still it has fleetingly good moments where you can imagine how it could have been better. Reeks of frightened executives dictating to the writers and director in a failed attempt to avoid the controversy of The Last Jedi.","displayName":"Oldmoviefan77","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:37:22.961Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:37:22.961Z","user":{"userId":"AFCF8650-4849-460B-8DE4-6389C14A6DA0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Oldmoviefan77","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing end the an amazing story","displayName":"Vanina","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:37:11.676Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:37:11.676Z","user":{"userId":"17A37550-22EA-42DE-9731-E77D4B0EF87F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Vanina","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"This is the first genuinely bad Star Wars movie.\n\nDaisy Ridley looks perpetually constipated and only closes her mouth twice in the entire movie.  She is not somebody audiences can easily connect with.  Plus there is never any doubt she will win every fight.  That was clearly established in The Force Awokens.  So it is difficult to muster any concern about what is going to happen to her Rey character.\n\nThe plot jumps quickly from scene to scene in a desperate attempt to not let the viewer realize nothing they are watching makes a lick of sense. \n\nPoor Leia.  The presence of Carrie Fisher is a major distraction.  Her performance is wooden and, for all the amazing effects, for some reason they couldn't make Leia's eyes be directed at the face of the person she is talking to.  And then she (spoiler) reaches out to Kylo with her now formidable Force powers and just makes him be good all of a sudden.  Seriously.  Just like that.  No internal dialog to explain what tf is happening.  Nothing.  He just decides to suddenly be a good guy again... because the Force.  Oh, but the strain of this is too much for her, so Leia lays down and dies.  But her body doesn't disappear like other Force masters... because.\n\nThere is, of course, a big battle at the end.  They fight a secret fleet of star destroyers that Palpatine (yes, he's back) has apparently been constructing somehow in secret on a remote hidden planet.  Also he has an insane clone posse that chant and cheer him on in his evil doings in his secret Sith Cave.  And apparently Palpy is strong enough to take out all the good guys on his own with his kightning powers.  Not bad for an old guy.  \n\nThe good guys, of course, defeat Palpatine's secret army at the end.  And in a throwaway line, it is revealed that they defeated the rest of the First Order (the origin of which is never explained, btw), too.  Yes, the evil group that the good guys have been fighting for 3 films we learn have been defeated via a single line of dialog assuring us the viewers that this has occurred.  We don't actually get to see it happen.\n\nHow was this travesty allowed into theaters?","displayName":"Rick C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:36:12.999Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T22:03:27.155Z","user":{"userId":"978380536","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rick C","accountLink":"/user/id/978380536"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good film not great.","displayName":"Eric P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:36:07.842Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:36:07.842Z","user":{"userId":"EE4B9E7F-DD9B-4008-9BC2-1678E45BE00B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Eric P","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved the movie. However I do feel incomplete and sad. It only makes me wonder how much more story could have been told if Last Jedi was in sync with the story. I know they tried to fix as many of the mistakes as possible but at times it feels rush. We will forever be left to wonder how it could have been.
