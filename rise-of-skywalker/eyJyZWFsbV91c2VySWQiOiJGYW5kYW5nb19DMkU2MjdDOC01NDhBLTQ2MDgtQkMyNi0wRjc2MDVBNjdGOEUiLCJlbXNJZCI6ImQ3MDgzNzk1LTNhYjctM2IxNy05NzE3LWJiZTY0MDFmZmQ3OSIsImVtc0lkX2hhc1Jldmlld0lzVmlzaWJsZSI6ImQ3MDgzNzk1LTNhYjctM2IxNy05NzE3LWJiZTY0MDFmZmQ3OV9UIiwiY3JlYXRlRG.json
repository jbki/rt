This movie would be actually good if not for the first and second movies. The Last Jedi and The Force Awakens were so bad that even this movie can't fix all the plot holes. If this was the only movie of the new trylogy it would be 7/10. Because of those two its 4/10. Also that full memory wipe .... em ... what with the sith transcript? Shouldn't it get wiped as well? And clearing the whole memory system to install one language? Ok. Maybe this movie is bad. Apparently everybody can breathe in the space now. But seriously, If not for 2 previous movies Abrams wouldn't be cornered so much. There was nothing to be saved and he did his best I think. The audience score is elevated tho. It shouldn't be 86%. There is no way that so many ppl liked it. This movie deserves 50%, at best 60%. It is definitelly better than The Last Jedi but it suffers because of The Last Jedi and The Force Awakens.\n\nOk. The audience score is fake. It might be a bug or they did it on purpose.","displayName":"Filip W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2932068623471446/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T13:31:48.127Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:30:02.749Z","user":{"userId":"978458644","realm":"RT","displayName":"Filip W","accountLink":"/user/id/978458644"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"It's like \"let's make a new trilogy in 1 movie, let's ignore all the lore\"","displayName":"Marco F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1248305458536607/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T13:28:25.272Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:51:31.357Z","user":{"userId":"974883990","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marco F","accountLink":"/user/id/974883990"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This could be the worst movie ever made.
