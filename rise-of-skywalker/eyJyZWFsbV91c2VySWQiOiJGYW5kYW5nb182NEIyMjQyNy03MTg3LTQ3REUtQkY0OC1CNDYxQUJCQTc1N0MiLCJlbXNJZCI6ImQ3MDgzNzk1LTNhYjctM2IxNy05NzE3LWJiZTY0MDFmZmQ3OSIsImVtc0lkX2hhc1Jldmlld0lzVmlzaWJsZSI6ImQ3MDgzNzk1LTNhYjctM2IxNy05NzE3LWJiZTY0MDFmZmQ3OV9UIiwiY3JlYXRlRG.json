I knew he could have done a better job if he didn't have to close up a lot of ends, and wrap up the story to repair what damage was done. I liked it and thought it did well. The main critics rated the last jedi highly, so I know not to believe what they think is a \"Good Film\". \n\nMay the force be with you.","displayName":"Travis P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1290537264490664/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T08:43:05.869Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T08:43:10.752Z","user":{"userId":"978473497","realm":"RT","displayName":"Travis P","accountLink":"/user/id/978473497"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it! great wrap uo to a decades old saga","displayName":"Mooretc5","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T08:42:34.461Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T08:42:34.461Z","user":{"userId":"3ba29059-b2ac-4fdd-86c6-e54a53c19efd","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mooretc5","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Horrible movie, waste of time, Rey Skywalker, honestly that's all I have to say.","displayName":"Alex M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T08:41:37.967Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T08:41:37.967Z","user":{"userId":"63B52E2A-8690-4750-999D-730DB5FC72F1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Alex M","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"ONE WORD can describe this film, but I don't seem to have it in my vocabulary at the moment. \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\" is BY FAR the most thrilling and entertaining of the sequel trilogy films, and is BY A CONSIDERABLE MARGIN, the most fan serving film of almost all of cinema (rivalled only by \"Avengers Endgame\"). As far as finales go, the film has a satisfying conclusion (lots of fan service)––milking the relationship between Rey and Kylo for all its worth, which carries the film. However, the epic science fiction spectacle often relies on nostalgia and fan service to conjure up excitement within the audience, but it is EPIC nonetheless. Star Wars as we know it is GONE, and that thought alone makes this film A WIN.","displayName":"Zaufufu T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T08:41:11.188Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T08:41:11.188Z","user":{"userId":"978473491","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zaufufu T","accountLink":"/user/id/978473491"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Spectacular.
