Of coarse the movie will try to play off of the original trilogy at times, but does well at holding on to it's own.  Great finish to the current trilogy.

And serves it up over and over again. This film answers all the questions you want answering. There are some great fan service moments. Even righting some wrongs back to the very first film. The first 30 minutes are superb. The special effects throughout the film are outstanding, comedy moments are perfect. It's very dark in some places and You may want to think twice before taking some very young children.","displayName":"Andrew M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3250981091642613/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T00:22:46.779Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T00:22:55.138Z","user":{"userId":"978454663","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew M","accountLink":"/user/id/978454663"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was amazing!!!!
