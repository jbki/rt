We have completely ignored physics, normal movie pacing, lore, continuity, respect for story telling, paying off unanswered questions and general intelligence of most human beings.

For this lifetime SW fan, this movie was a terribly disappointing end to the Skywalker saga.  Plot twists, surprise cameos, etc. are all pretty dull if they make no sense.  The best thing  I can say about Episode IX is that it's not as bad as episode VIII.  \"The Last Jedi\" was downright appalling and an insult to us SW fans.  \"Rise of Skywalker\" is just an insult to our intelligence.  Check your brain at the door and you might be entertained.  Unfortunately, I wanted more.","displayName":"Bob K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100003703445707/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:26:51.754Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:26:58.907Z","user":{"userId":"931419337","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bob K","accountLink":"/user/id/931419337"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"i thought this movie was amazing.
