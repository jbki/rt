With that said, if you turn your brain off and pretend that Star Wars 1-6 didn't exist, then maybe you will like the visuals and/or the film.  Disney missed the ball on this big time by alienating longtime fans. This sucked. Poor George Lucas. If a George Lucas version exists, I really want to see it. He would never have brought Palpatine back to this story. After all, he did die  in Return of the Jedi, remember? Long live the REAL Star Wars where Anakin is the chosen one for real.","displayName":"BeBe C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T02:05:16.387Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T02:05:41.301Z","user":{"userId":"976947307","realm":"RT","displayName":"BeBe C","accountLink":"/user/id/976947307"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"}]}
