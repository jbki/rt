Which clearly reveals the filmmakers went into this trilogy without a plan.\n\nJJ Abrams attempts to salvage what he can from the previous film - The Last Jedi - that subverted Disney's sequel trilogy and derailed any intended story arc, but there's little left to work with. So what he concocts is a cobbled-together narrative mess flying all over the place, throwing in plenty of nostalgia points in an attempt to win back the old fans it has alienated. But what he serves up are hollow characters, a hollow story, and hollow emotions – with the Emperor Palapatine retconned back from the dead since the main villain (Snoke) was prematurely killed in the last film. And even the set-pieces are a let down.","displayName":"Skilly W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:41:46.870Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:41:56.558Z","user":{"userId":"976986080","realm":"RT","displayName":"Skilly W","accountLink":"/user/id/976986080"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"True to the original formula!
