It was filled with suspense and action throughout, and there were no parts that I disliked. although it was not perfect, it did a damn good job at what it needed to do. The senate was portrayed in a truly frightening but accurate way, and the threat was believable. Over all, this film was a good standalone film, a good conclusion to a trilogy, and a good conclusion to a nine film saga that started forty-two years ago.","displayName":"john d","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:04:32.320Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:05:20.168Z","user":{"userId":"977708229","realm":"RT","displayName":"john d","accountLink":"/user/id/977708229"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Not a perfect finale, but satisfying enough.

Breaks a lot of the Star Wars lore on every scene, why does the emperor is back if the chosen one already killed him? Now we can teleport things that easy? The xwing from Luke was ok all this time and he was not able to take it and save everyone in the last movie? What's the point of erasing C3PO memory if 5 min later it recovers it with no consequences?, whats the point on killing every Skywalker? So a new plain girl can get its place? This is Terminator Dark Fate with star wars theme.","displayName":"Norma S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2555815531138791/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:04:26.574Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:04:36.962Z","user":{"userId":"978460105","realm":"RT","displayName":"Norma S","accountLink":"/user/id/978460105"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My favorite film in the new trilogy.","displayName":"Mark K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10101310841051240/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:04:19.118Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:04:25.263Z","user":{"userId":"978460134","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark K","accountLink":"/user/id/978460134"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Solid ending to the saga","displayName":"Devin S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/473531289965479/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:04:10.943Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:04:18.981Z","user":{"userId":"978460142","realm":"RT","displayName":"Devin S","accountLink":"/user/id/978460142"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Awful script and terrible pacing.
