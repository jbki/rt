I think Star Wars became the THING to criticize. Audiences developed a hyperbolic love/hate relationship with every release. I'm not going to disprove that, I guess. As a life long Star Wars fan, having been watching the movies for almost 3 decades, I absolutely loved this film. It's extremely fast paced, it's packed with details that probably fly over the heads of fans that aren't aware of extra cinematic content, and it features some controversial choices in narratove, but it absolutely soars as a bookend to the Skywalker Saga. I fell in love with the characters all over again, it featured classic comedic relief from new and old characters, its action sequences are superb, and I left the movie feeling completely satisfied. I've seen it twice, and I'll probably see it again before it leaves theatres. To all of you fans out there, ignore the reviews, go in with a hopeful perspective. And may the force be with you, always.","displayName":"Kevin J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10102838477640360/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T09:44:57.714Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T09:45:03.323Z","user":{"userId":"978482807","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kevin J","accountLink":"/user/id/978482807"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was amazing!!!
