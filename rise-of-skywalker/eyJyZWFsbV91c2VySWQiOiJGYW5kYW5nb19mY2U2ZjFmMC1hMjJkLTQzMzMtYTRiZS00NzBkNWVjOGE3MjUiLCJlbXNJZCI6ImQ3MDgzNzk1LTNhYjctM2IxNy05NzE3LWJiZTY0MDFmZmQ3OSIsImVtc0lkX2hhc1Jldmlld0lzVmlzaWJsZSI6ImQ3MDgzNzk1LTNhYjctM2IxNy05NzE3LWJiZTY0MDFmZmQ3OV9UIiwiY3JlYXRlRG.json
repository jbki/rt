It celebrates the relationships that fans have for the Skywalkers and it rewards the fans who have been patrons of the Star Wars franchise since the 70s. The acting from most of the cast members are noteworthy, particularly from Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley. The lightsaber choreography is amazing, although the Red Room fight scene from the Last Jedi is still my favorite. The scenes here, though, are magnificent. The Death Star scene is so beautifully shot; the environment of each planet is beautifully captured (desert planets look like desert planets, tropical planets look like tropical planets). \n\nOn its own, ROS suffers from lack of cohesiveness in relation to the Last Jedi and I think that's where most fans are polarized -- the 50% wanted all of it to be bundled up with a bow on top, while the other 50% simply wanted a fun and entertaining adventure. I belong to the latter half. I enjoyed the film, and will probably see it again. Taking newly introduced elements of the Last Jedi out, though, I can see what Abrams was trying to pull off. But the movie is entertaining nonetheless. And I am happy with the Star Wars I got.","displayName":"Andrea J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000687298129/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T15:09:45.639Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T15:09:51.659Z","user":{"userId":"922573264","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrea J","accountLink":"/user/id/922573264"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"We loved it!
