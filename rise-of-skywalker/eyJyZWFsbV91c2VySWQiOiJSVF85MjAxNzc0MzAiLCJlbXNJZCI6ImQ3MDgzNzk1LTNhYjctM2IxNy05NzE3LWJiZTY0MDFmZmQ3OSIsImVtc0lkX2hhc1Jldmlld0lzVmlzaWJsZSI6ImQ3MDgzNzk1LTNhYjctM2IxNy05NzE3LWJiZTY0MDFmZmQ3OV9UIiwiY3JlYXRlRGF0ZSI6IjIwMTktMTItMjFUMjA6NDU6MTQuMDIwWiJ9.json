In fact, it is cowardly — afraid to say or do anything new, unique or innovative. It’s professionally put together but visually bland, fast paced but somehow boring, overstuffed yet empty and unwilling to slow down and find anything resembling joy. Mostly it’s unimaginative, corporate board room approved pablum filled to the brim with lowest common denominator fan service, recycling plot points and plagiarizing from better films as it checks a box, checks another, points at a reference, ad nauseam for two plus hours. There’s little in the way of humor, emotion, character development or internal conflict, just a series of predictable MacGuffin chases before the inevitable victory hugs preceding the ending credits. Totally safe and totally forgettable. I’ll be “lightspeed skipping” ahead to another, better movie.","displayName":"Ace","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:45:06.065Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:45:06.065Z","user":{"userId":"DDAC5424-F5AD-4810-9F26-EB5F64C4D949","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ace","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Felt like a rushed scavenger hunt but the chemistry between Rey and Kylo made up for most of it.","displayName":"Kelcey H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:45:05.386Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:45:05.386Z","user":{"userId":"978460975","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kelcey H","accountLink":"/user/id/978460975"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Rushed, horrible plot.

With the Rise of Skywalker I believe they tried to appease their unhappy core fan base. The movie is clearly put together to answer questions and address problems created by prior movies. It will not make everyone happy because for some reason some people actually enjoyed the last Jedi, this movie seemed to do all it could to counteract mistakes made in it. I would recommend the movie to the core fan base like me.","displayName":"WRWJR","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:44:35.533Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:44:35.533Z","user":{"userId":"103CF9C1-5760-47CB-8CFE-C534F4050C03","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"WRWJR","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"The inclusion of Palpatine was a horrible idea, none of the characters see any lessons learned or growth like in TLJ, the breakneck pacing hinders the film, just overall bad execution from JJ.","displayName":"Jacob F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002252036786/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:44:32.282Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:44:39.433Z","user":{"userId":"909208163","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jacob F","accountLink":"/user/id/909208163"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It’s Star Wars!

Thanks for the insults to my intelligence - film critique itself is not a science, it's just another opinion and some may polish their columns with flowery words and references but they remain just that.
