Had a relatively neat story arc that wrapped up all the loose ends and salvaged the storyline after Ryan Johnson's demolition derby of all things Star Wars. Actually cared a bit for the characters for the first time in the new trilogy and the final scenes were actually pretty awesome. Overall well worth watching.","displayName":"Andrew B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T16:18:09.387Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T16:18:18.797Z","user":{"userId":"976968554","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew B","accountLink":"/user/id/976968554"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"10/10! The best of the new trilogy and up there for the series as a whole honestly. Packed full of action, classic awe inspiring \"star wars\" moments and laughs. Forget the critics squabbling over wether or not this movie is \"a disservice\" to the previous film (The Last Jedi) and *please* stop trying to interject social commentary into these movies. It's Star Wars! It's not right that we live in a world where people are afraid to criticize a movie because they'll get labeled \"anti-progressive\" by the social media group-think mobs. Why does everything need to be so political these days lol. Narratively speaking, the previous film had objectively poor storytelling and did little to advance the plot of the trilogy overall. It also did little to advance the development of these great new characters we were given in The Force Awakens. The Rise of Skywalker not only course corrects all of this, but adds to the overall narrative in new and intriguing ways!!","displayName":"James  S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T16:17:59.157Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T16:17:59.157Z","user":{"userId":"978487102","realm":"RT","displayName":"James  S","accountLink":"/user/id/978487102"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A good conclusion to the series, and way better than the prequels.

I've seen all eight episodes, also Rogue One and I also went to see the reissues of episodes 4, 5 and 6 and I felt that episode 9 didn't live up to the hype or the anticipation. The only reason that I might recommend it is if someone has already seen the first eight episodes, then go and see it, that way you'll at least have seen the entire Star Wars saga. If you haven't kept up with the previous episodes, then don't waste your money. I'm sure that I'll get lots of loyal Star Wars fans that will disagree with me but that's my opinion.","displayName":"Ken","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T16:11:45.537Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T16:11:45.537Z","user":{"userId":"f002b74c-50da-42f1-b949-f91150303206","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ken","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Very enjoyable forget what some of the nerds and critics say","displayName":"Geoffrey B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T16:11:09.539Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T16:11:09.539Z","user":{"userId":"df38f13f-93d1-4cb0-8737-065b3a29797a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Geoffrey B","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"She made the right choice.","displayName":"Mark","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T16:10:08.435Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T16:10:08.435Z","user":{"userId":"f2184acb-470d-4369-abf1-d16840cdb94c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mark","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"}]}
