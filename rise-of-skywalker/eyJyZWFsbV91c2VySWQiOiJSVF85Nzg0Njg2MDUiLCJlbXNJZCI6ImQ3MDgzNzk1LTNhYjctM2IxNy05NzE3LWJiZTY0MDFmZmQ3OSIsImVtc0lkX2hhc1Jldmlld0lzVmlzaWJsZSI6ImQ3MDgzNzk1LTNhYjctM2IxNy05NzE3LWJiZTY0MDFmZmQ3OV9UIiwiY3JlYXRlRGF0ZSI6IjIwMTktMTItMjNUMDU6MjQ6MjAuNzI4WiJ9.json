For me it was satisfying and I left feeling a pretty good end to the saga. While it does have its issues with pacing, some minor story choices, and nit picky things, it still finds a way to make you smile throughout the whole movie. If you appreciate callbacks, Easter eggs, and good amounts of fan service(especially with the originals) you will enjoy this movie! Sadly its not as amazing as it shouldve been to bookend the saga, but I still found many many things I loved about this movie. Go see it especially if you like Star Wars!","displayName":"Kendrick L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T05:23:39.984Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T05:23:39.984Z","user":{"userId":"bcadb142-a299-4b92-89ef-d6c617e6a804","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kendrick L","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"how many times can they tell the same story!","displayName":"Margaret S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1231055050/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T05:23:30.999Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T05:23:35.641Z","user":{"userId":"910700683","realm":"RT","displayName":"Margaret S","accountLink":"/user/id/910700683"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved it! Great bookend to the Skywalker saga!!! After the disappointment of Last Jedi, Rise of Skywalker has redeemed it. JJ Abrams did a fantastic job, it had great cameos, humor, and it finally picks up and uses the character story lines setup in Force Awakens. There are parts that seem to jump around fairly quick and doesn’t give you much time to process but at least there isn’t a big chunk that’s not relevant to the movie plot like in Last Jedi.

No movie is perfect, but this is a clear home-run and a half. JJ Abrams masterfully took everything we know and love about each episode of Star Wars and told an absolutely incredible story that makes so much sense and answers the fans' gnawing questions. The Skywalker Saga is finished with style thanks to the brilliance of Abrams, the cast, and crew. As a 2nd generation fan of 20 years, The Rise of Skywalker warms my heart and makes all of these years so worthwhile. I have so much love and gratitude to George Lucas for creating this galaxy far far away 42 years ago. Thank you.","displayName":"Jake H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1244916135674718/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T05:23:17.957Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T05:23:30.822Z","user":{"userId":"977952267","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jake H","accountLink":"/user/id/977952267"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie was amazing definitely must see","displayName":"Michael B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T05:23:08.713Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T05:23:08.713Z","user":{"userId":"3C2A67FF-139F-44A0-8C5F-11994AB48AF3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I wish the movie was at least 3 hours long, I was expecting a specific character to be in the movie, and there wasnt two songs in the movie that I wanted to hear either.
