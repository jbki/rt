There was too much of nothing, I don't want to give spoilers, the doctor sticking his finger where it don't go was more tolerable then this train wreck. What is so hard in following the formula that was set before, Disney just went about it the wrong way, and made a poor expensive attempt to rectify the problem, but it is too late. I hope Disney  wakes up, and listen  to George Lucas, or cut their losses and stop messing up a legend. You know it's  a Disney movie when a lightsaber knocks you out vs dismembering a person üôÑ. Try starting a Disney  rated R division, get gritty like all of the stories you acquired were ment to be.","displayName":"Joey M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2477482698967073/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-22T03:29:12.756Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:41:28.655Z","user":{"userId":"978138840","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joey M","accountLink":"/user/id/978138840"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a awesome plot twister!!","displayName":"Sandy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T03:29:12.157Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T03:29:12.157Z","user":{"userId":"732C7DA2-CC30-42A6-B2D2-4438B132E488","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sandy","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!
