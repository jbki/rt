The flaws are a bit obvious as Abrams is trying to end the trilogy the way he wanted it started even though the last film doesn’t quite follow the path he laid down.

Unfortunately, Disney have zero respect or affection for the original trilogy as the new trilogy was either entirely pointless retreading or retcon of original films. It’s a shame that studios constantly underestimate an audience’s intelligence and feel that throwing a lot of money on the screen is all that audience’s expect. The two stars are for the technical achievement and the fantastic John Williams score - the characters and plot are all thin and designed to be consumed and disgraced like fast food. This is the McDonald’s of film making.
