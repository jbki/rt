Visually very cool and attractive.  As a Star Wars story it leaves much to be desired.

It was a nice action/sci-fi movie. Wasn't that great a Star Wars movie. Too rushed. Too many unforced errors. Too many ways that it appears (whether it was the creators intentions or not) to dismiss Last Jedi. Too many ways that it harmed character development in the name of fan service. I'm sure it will be a crowd pleaser to many, but as a wrap up for this series it stumbled and fell flat.","displayName":"Robert M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/707804045/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T22:38:26.346Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T22:38:47.877Z","user":{"userId":"849904536","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert M","accountLink":"/user/id/849904536"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"a good save from JJ I think. he was given a hospital pass but did a good job.
