I'm a Star Wars fan. That means it is quite literally my right and half of my fun in seeing the movies to whine and bitch about the stuff that's stupid. When The Force Awakens came out, I LOVED it. I saw it a couple more times and saw some more flaws. Hated that Rey didn't get the hero's journey we all deserved, despised Moz screaming Han's name and thus selling them out to First Order spies, but loved everything else. The questions that Abrams set up were great. it was nostalgic and yet new. I never understood how fans who hated Kylo Ren/Ben Solo for being \"a baby\" could be fans of either Anakin or Luke. He's a great antagonist and he isn't replaced by senior citizen or robot with breathing problems. \n\nThen came The Last Jedi. Saw that in the theaters about three times because I was so torn by what I was seeing. In the end I felt the movie had a few moments I loved, but overall I very much disliked every decision they made to downplay TFA and what took place. \n\nNow we come to The Rise of Skywalker. The only thing I can say that I hated about the film is the title. It should not have been called The Rise of Skywalker. It's misleading and overall pointless. But this movie fixed the terrible decision making of the second film in this franchise without dismissing it outright. Considering what JJ had to work with, he did a brilliant job.  It will make you laugh, cheer, cry and feel anger, but it was well done and it managed to make sense of saga that lost it's way long before Disney purchased the rights to Star Wars. \n\nIf you hated this film, you haven't given it the chance it deserves. I'm excited to drag my family to the theaters to see it. I'm looking forward to witnessing it at least twice more in the theaters. \n\nThank you JJ Abrams (even if you won't admit the second one sucked) for both TFA and TROS. I never doubted you for a second.  (ALSO my tickets were purchased at Megaplex in UT, so screw Rotten Tomatoes if they try to say my review isn't verified. We don't all buy our tickets through Fandango's garbage website)","displayName":"Rusti I","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1392172764/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-21T07:05:33.218Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T21:26:52.237Z","user":{"userId":"876509915","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rusti I","accountLink":"/user/id/876509915"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Comes no where close to be able to compare to the other movies","displayName":"Zachary","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T07:05:32.846Z","updateDate":"2020-01-04T00:43:03.494Z","user":{"userId":"47CF4033-EC4D-430F-977F-EFAF70D08F0E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Zachary","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Frantic with little time to take in what was happening.  Drops questions from last jedi, EU material and even from the characters in the movie itself all so that it can end sooner. While I have problems with Last Jedi, I did like what Rian Johnson was trying to do. Unfortunately rather then build on the story presented from the previous movies, JJ decides to instead negate the previous film to bring the trilogy back to where he wanted it. In doing so he creates plotholes in both Last Jedi and Force awakens. I love the actors in the three films, set design and choreography were both top notch. Nearly every problem in this film is tied entirely to writing and direction, and I feel sorry for everyone who was involved in this film who might get misplaced blame for it's issues. in all honesty, The Last Jedi would have been a better ending for this series of movies.\nEdit: Waiting for the day when Rotten tomatoes will verify tickets that werent' purchased through their parent site. I personally know no one who purchases tickets through fandango.","displayName":"Stephen M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000073248827/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T06:51:07.120Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:40:44.026Z","user":{"userId":"954305205","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stephen M","accountLink":"/user/id/954305205"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"The movie was rushed, not original and had many holes.
