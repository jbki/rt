Not to be confused with formal human history books.  Great movie, enjoyed every minute of it.  I'd rate it 2 in the series, behind A New Hope.  Only because I saw ANH at the theater in 1977, as a 12yr old, so it has more sentimental value.....","displayName":"Stephen D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T17:07:40.108Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T17:07:40.108Z","user":{"userId":"31f43f9d-36b4-4284-b3c4-5b12a0bd5d3b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Stephen D","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Loud but not very spectacular","displayName":"Frances s","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T17:06:34.728Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T17:06:38.255Z","user":{"userId":"da8450c1-bdd2-450a-93bc-8f0bb31364a2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Frances s","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Our whole family absolutely loved this movie.

But the plot is pretty stupid.  The characters are thin and do things that don't make sense.  The movie was mildly entertaining but at no point was I on the edge of my seat.  Unfortunately it just ends up being another Star Wars movie that I don't think I will ever watch again.","displayName":"Darien G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T17:06:07.939Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T17:06:07.939Z","user":{"userId":"49824f06-fbdc-401d-8d8a-0a9b5af83f9f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Darien G","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Way over the top, way too far fetched,  they invent stuff that never happens.

There are certainly some moments where I would have liked to see something different but the movie delivers a solid wrap to the Skywalker Saga which is not an easy thing to do.  Plenty of light-hearted moments that come with Star Wars mixed with drama and plenty of action.  Great lightsaber battles which is always a key.  Really enjoyed the film and our whole family (me + wife and kids aged 4, 7 & 9) enjoyed it as well.","displayName":"A H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T17:03:38.323Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T17:03:44.633Z","user":{"userId":"901216250","realm":"RT","displayName":"A H","accountLink":"/user/id/901216250"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"}]}
