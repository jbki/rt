I really enjoyed this film. The actors were good, I didnt get too lost in the story. However, there were some blaring issues with it that took away from the story.\n1) I did not like the death of a certain character. It happens when every character has seen the error of their ways....they die.\n2) Why cast Keri Russel if youre going to hide her face the entire time? Tribal markings or tattoos on her face wouldve been better. JJ.A simply shouldve given that role to an unknown who needed it more than KR.\n3) Rey is not a  Skywalker, not in the bloodline. I did not agree w/ the decision of the character taking that last name\n4) Finn never reveals what he always wanted to tell Rey. He brings it up. It is brought up again, then forgotten. Elementary screenwriting mistake.","displayName":"Angela C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:54:49.030Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:54:49.030Z","user":{"userId":"8a1f0788-a41c-481e-99db-7921bb1ae901","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Angela C","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"A poorly conceived and executed mess. Really embarrassing. I was ashamed. Mid-3rd was somewhat entertaining, but ending was an insult. Actors tried their best, but Disney's horrible script wasted these characters. I even question the action choreography ... noticeable errors .. e.g., storm troopers falling down before being shot.","displayName":"Duane R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002444812728/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:54:41.670Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:59:07.372Z","user":{"userId":"913028902","realm":"RT","displayName":"Duane R","accountLink":"/user/id/913028902"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Loved the movie!
