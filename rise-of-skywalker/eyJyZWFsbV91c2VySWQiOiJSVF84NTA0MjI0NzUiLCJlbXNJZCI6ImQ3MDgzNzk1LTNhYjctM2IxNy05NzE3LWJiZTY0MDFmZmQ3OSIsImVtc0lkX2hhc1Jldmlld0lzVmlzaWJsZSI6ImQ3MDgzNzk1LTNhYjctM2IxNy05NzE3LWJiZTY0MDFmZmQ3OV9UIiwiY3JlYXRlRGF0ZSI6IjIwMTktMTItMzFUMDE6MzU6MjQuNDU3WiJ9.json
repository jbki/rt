Its the same garbage all over again with silly characters and cgi to the max. The entire film looks like a video game. The only redeeming thing was the nostalgia and flashbacks of the real characters that made star wars great. This new version is terrible and a waste of your time and energy. Go see Uncut gems.","displayName":"davidson i","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T01:34:03.985Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T01:34:03.985Z","user":{"userId":"978175752","realm":"RT","displayName":"davidson i","accountLink":"/user/id/978175752"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Highly recommend this movie.

Rey becomes the Jedi warrior she was born to be, saves the Empire from the Evil Palpatine.  Cameos by many old favorites will soften your heart. J.J Abrams did a great job getting that much story into 2 1/2 hrs. Will definitely see this several times.","displayName":"Cindy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T01:29:44.394Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T01:29:44.394Z","user":{"userId":"1ba600b8-df19-4d90-af09-08bfb949dc56","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Cindy","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I've seen it twice now and truly liked it better the 2nd time.
