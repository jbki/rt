Boring with plot holes everywhere. This movie destroys the original 3 movies making the events pointless. \nLook, it's a watch once and never look back type movie. Should you go to the cinema, well that's up to you, however I don't think we should be awarding crappy work with our hard earn dollars. \nI will say that Rian had messed the direction so bad, it would have been a tough job for JJ to clean up, yet I could have come up with a better plot myself.","displayName":"Serg J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:58:55.034Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:59:04.311Z","user":{"userId":"977824458","realm":"RT","displayName":"Serg J","accountLink":"/user/id/977824458"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This movie felt more like a Star Wars movie out of the this Sequel Trilogy. What I mean by that the 3 main characters finally went out on a adventure together for the 1st in this film and then later separated to their own character quest adventure: much like the Original Trilogy characters did in those movies. After watching this movie I asked myself if I was entertained? Yes, I had a blast watching this movie with all the feels like I had with the Original Trilogy gave me as a kid!","displayName":"RocStarrJEDI","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:58:32.646Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:58:32.646Z","user":{"userId":"19203DE7-DCD8-4BBB-BDB6-C6DC69A7A4F0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"RocStarrJEDI","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I find it hard to believe anything could be worse than last Jedi.

While I really liked the Last Jedi, I'm really happy they corrected some of the poorer points of that movie (Rose, Rey's parentage, etc.) and expanded on the Rey/Kylo connection. Definitely the best if this trilogy and a fitting ending. Really strong performances by the main cast other than Poe, who was pretty lackluster in my opinion. Loved the return of Landon and the send off of Carrie Fisher.","displayName":"Paul A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:57:30.400Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:57:36.476Z","user":{"userId":"976398791","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paul A","accountLink":"/user/id/976398791"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Want my money back!!!
