However, there were some plot holes that were never summed up (since this is the last one in the series after all) and the interaction between other characters seemed rushed.  Even the Knights of Ren just randomly came out of nowhere with no real backstory.  This movie should have been made into 2 separate movies with other plot lines explained more and character building.  There was NO character development other than Rey and Kylo.","displayName":"Christina","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T11:50:44.096Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T11:50:44.096Z","user":{"userId":"40be6143-5594-4c5f-938b-cd6c16467837","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Christina","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"So good!!!

It almost seemed like it was cartoonish.  Ray certainly was the best of the lot and yes,  being able to bring Carrie Fisher into the film in such a major role was indeed a plus.  They did a great job of that.  It was such a disappointment.  Skip the 3D and DX seating and it might be a better film.","displayName":"L M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T11:49:37.241Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T11:49:38.539Z","user":{"userId":"69092cae-1bc4-4833-9186-ace2e2d18b48","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"L M","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Not a perfect movie but I enjoyed it very much.
