Revenge of the Sith\n2. The Empire Strikes Back\n3. The Rise of Skywalker\n\nI honestly felt like from the moment it started until it ended I loved every second of it, for me it was such an interesting story (I was 100% hooked in). I haven't felt this way about anything Star Wars since Revenge of the Sith, for me it's all about the story and this story was very was engaging. It was subject matter that actually mattered to me as a viewer and Star Wars fan, It literally exceeded every possible expectation I could have had for it. I honestly can't even fathom that anyone couldn't love it. I felt like JJ pulled the whole thing together and saved the whole final trilogy from being an epic disaster (after the Last Jedi, which I like but is my least favorite Star Wars film out of all of them), I only hoped for decent (I got near perfection). \nI felt like this was the ultimate Thank you üôè to us Star Wars fans that have been there since the beginning, almost a love letter to us to say \"Thank you and we appreciate you\"!\n\nI can't fathom any negativity toward it in ANY way.","displayName":"Robert J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/157301418894397/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:21:18.790Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:21:24.228Z","user":{"userId":"978453327","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert J","accountLink":"/user/id/978453327"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Things that would have made this 5 stars for me: Anakin showing up in ghost form & Rey being a clone of some sort.
