The film was so greatly done by JJ Abrams and Lucas Films, along with George Lucas himself.  The plot was very well written.  The script kept my mind on the screen the entire duration of the film.  Why did I even waste my time watching all the spoilers on YouTube?  All the YouTubers out there know who you are that try to ruin it for the audience.  I’ll rate this film of the recent trilogy as my favorite.  Is it my favorite Star Wars overall?  Absolutely not!!!
