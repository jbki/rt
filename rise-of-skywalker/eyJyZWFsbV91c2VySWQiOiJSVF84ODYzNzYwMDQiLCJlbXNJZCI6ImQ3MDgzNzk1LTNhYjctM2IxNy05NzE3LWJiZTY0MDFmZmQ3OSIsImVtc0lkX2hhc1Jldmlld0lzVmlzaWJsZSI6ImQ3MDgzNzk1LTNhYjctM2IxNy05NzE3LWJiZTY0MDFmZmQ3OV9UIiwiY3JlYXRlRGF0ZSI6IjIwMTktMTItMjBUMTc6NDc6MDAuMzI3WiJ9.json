I had low expectations going in here because of the first two movies which I thought were just OK. Many of the things that frustrated me about the first 2 were corrected in this one and I appreciate that. I'm surprised some reviewers are saying this was the worst Star Wars ever, they are dead wrong.","displayName":"Michael Z","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10211254695423944/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:46:54.205Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:46:59.034Z","user":{"userId":"977321933","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael Z","accountLink":"/user/id/977321933"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's epic, a space opera at its finest as it should be.","displayName":"Edgar C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/111815020190154/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:46:54.129Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:46:56.728Z","user":{"userId":"978215096","realm":"RT","displayName":"Edgar C","accountLink":"/user/id/978215096"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Absolutely horrendous end to an already terrible sequel trilogy.","displayName":"Nathaniel M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001424976175/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:46:53.093Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:47:00.584Z","user":{"userId":"913542142","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nathaniel M","accountLink":"/user/id/913542142"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"All I can say, the movie was awesome and had it's epic moments but also bring Tissues because it's a train full with emotions.","displayName":"Abel L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/846669722457480/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:46:43.603Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:46:54.424Z","user":{"userId":"978451570","realm":"RT","displayName":"Abel L","accountLink":"/user/id/978451570"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I'm not sure what movie the 'Critics' saw, but it cannot have been the same movie I saw.  I have re-read many of their reviews and have determined that they could quite possibly be trolls trying to elicit a reaction, or, possibly they don't understand the rich legacy of what has come before it.  Quite simply, this was without a doubt my favorite of all of them.  I know, this is a risky thing to say, I get it.  \n\nDon't get me wrong.  On it's own, it is good.  But, as a part of the larger story, it was perfect.  Enjoyable on every level.  I made the mistake of reading some early reviews and waited throughout the movie for those observations to materialize, which they didn't.  Maybe it was good that I wasn't expecting much, because I sat in my seat after the movie reflecting on what I just saw, not shocked, just happy.  It was an intelligent movie with heart and I applaud those that made it.  Maybe there is some truth in the saying \"If you can't do it, become a critic\".\n\nExcitement, it had it in droves.  Passion, for a Star Wars fan, yes, more than any before it.   Did it answer questions?  Yes.  Did it have action?  Of course, it is a Star Wars movie.  Did it require you to think with some intelligent introspection?  Yes, which is something that has been missing in many current movie formulas.\n\nI won't judge anyone that doesn't get it (yes I will), but I will say that I have every intention of going again.","displayName":"Mark A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10218550237444996/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:46:37.169Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:46:46.193Z","user":{"userId":"978451306","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark A","accountLink":"/user/id/978451306"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"would only have changed one thing.
