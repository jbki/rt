Shame on you Disney.  Cringe Jokes all around the movie, Finn never told to rey what it wanted to say, emotional fellings with rey, rose, and the deserter Girl... Anoher Droid who always say dont touch me? For what reason that droid? he never was usefull , at the end was rey who tell the resistend wheres palpatine.","displayName":"Pedro F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10155460945917960/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:34:09.845Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:34:15.277Z","user":{"userId":"976967546","realm":"RT","displayName":"Pedro F","accountLink":"/user/id/976967546"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great conclusion to a trilogy that had so much potential but misfired due to The Last Jedi.  If only JJ Abrams could have directed all three movies.  Abrams did a fantastic job giving fans what they want and doing his best to tie up the loose ends that The Last Jedi created.  I feel that he truly understands what makes Star Wars special to so many, and didn't try and take it in some crazy direction of his own.  I thought the Rise of Skywalker was very well done and helped me find new love for the newer movies of the franchise. I left the theater feeling really good this time, unlike the feeling I had after seeing The Last Jedi.","displayName":"M S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:33:56.956Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T22:04:01.470Z","user":{"userId":"977426949","realm":"RT","displayName":"M S","accountLink":"/user/id/977426949"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I thought it was really well paced.
