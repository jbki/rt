In an attempt to answer almost every question that is left unanswered in past movies the pacing of this movie is very quick, at some points uncomfortably so, especially at the beginning of the movie. However, the story is engaging, the actors remain phenomenal, the characters make sense again, the special effects are extraordinarily well done, and there are plenty of emotions to be thrown at the audience. The ending may leave some unsatisfied as Abrams and Disney take the safe way out of the Skywalker Saga. Nonetheless, it should be a worthy flick for many fans and if not the best, a good conclusion to a saga that has affected many.","displayName":"Josh B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/542566746104017/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T17:55:41.382Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T17:56:21.269Z","user":{"userId":"976949614","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josh B","accountLink":"/user/id/976949614"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Don't listen to these critics go see it!!!!!","displayName":"Clint H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/581801847/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T17:55:31.729Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T17:55:35.700Z","user":{"userId":"920260083","realm":"RT","displayName":"Clint H","accountLink":"/user/id/920260083"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"rushed and crowded with story.","displayName":"Brent","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T17:55:17.048Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T17:55:17.048Z","user":{"userId":"4741E144-5850-4C46-8989-88AE853E54D5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Brent","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Poteva essere lo Star Wars più bello di sempre.","displayName":"Chiara S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10220695801565672/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T17:54:25.709Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T17:54:51.274Z","user":{"userId":"978470783","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chiara S","accountLink":"/user/id/978470783"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Story and plot were choppy.
