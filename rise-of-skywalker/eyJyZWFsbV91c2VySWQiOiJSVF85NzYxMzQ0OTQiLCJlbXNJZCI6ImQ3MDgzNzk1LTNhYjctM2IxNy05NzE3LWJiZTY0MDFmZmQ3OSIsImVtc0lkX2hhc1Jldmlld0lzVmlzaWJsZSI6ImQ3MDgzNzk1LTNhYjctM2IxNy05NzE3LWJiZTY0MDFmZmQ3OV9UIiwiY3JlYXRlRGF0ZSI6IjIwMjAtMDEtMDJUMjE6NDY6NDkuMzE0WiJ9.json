The film had a perfect mix of suspense and action, with great fight scenes, as well as interesting conversations. Finding out who Rey is and watching Kylo's resolution were also quite satisfactory. There were also a few surprises that made tears of joy spring to my eyes... No, it didn't quite live up to the original trilogy, or even the prequels, but neither was it a waste of money. I will definitely watch it again when it's available as a DVD.","displayName":"TeeHi","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T21:34:51.668Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T21:34:51.668Z","user":{"userId":"5151b2a3-2026-49b7-92e2-06a58f7eaea0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"TeeHi","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Best Star Wars in a long while. Best ever? Heck no. But it is certainly better then the last one and all the prequel ones. Starts fast, goes fast, and the ending gave this old nerd a good bit of closure.

The trilogy of trilogies is over, and I'm happy for it.","displayName":"David","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T21:34:43.690Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T21:34:43.690Z","user":{"userId":"D8E99A7A-CBD4-41DC-BFCF-30AEFCA16E0E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"David","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"}]}
