Poorly constructed script, confused with situations played. With a bad message. Bad jokes. JJ tried to undo episode 8 and the original trilogies. Why did we have the whole skywalker story if Anakin wasn't the one? Star Wars has always been a message of hope movie. BEN SOLO dies in a stupid way after redeeming himself. In the end no skywalker was happy. Ben and Rey kiss, he dies and then she's partying with poe and finn, it gets totally meaningless. Finn had evolved at eight and retreated at nine, it was just Rey and Rey. And Rey is so perfect that he doesn't need anyone in the end. It adopts the name ok. Honestly .... Horrible. Even the kids didn't like it.","displayName":"Deborah P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1258160681061626/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:43:17.506Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:49:01.052Z","user":{"userId":"978442150","realm":"RT","displayName":"Deborah P","accountLink":"/user/id/978442150"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Solid movie, jj Abrams did well with the shit show he was left from Johnson, answers all questions and wraps up the saga well.","displayName":"Stefan T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2473164576229667/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:42:30.228Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:42:35.371Z","user":{"userId":"978442200","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stefan T","accountLink":"/user/id/978442200"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The plot was so ridiculous!
