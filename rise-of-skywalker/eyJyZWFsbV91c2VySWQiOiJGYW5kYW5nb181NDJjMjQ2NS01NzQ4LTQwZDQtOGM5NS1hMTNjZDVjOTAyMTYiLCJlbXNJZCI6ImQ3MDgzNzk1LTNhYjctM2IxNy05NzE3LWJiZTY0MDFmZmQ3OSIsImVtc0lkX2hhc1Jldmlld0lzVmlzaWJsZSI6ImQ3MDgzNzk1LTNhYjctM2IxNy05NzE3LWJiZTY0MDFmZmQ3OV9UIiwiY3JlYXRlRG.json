JJ and his team answered long-lost questions that fans have been speculating on for decades. The film is not without error, but how the film develops with plot and characters will satisfy the Star Wars itch we've all had, which makes up for the imperfections along the way.","displayName":"Brian M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/761425423/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:28:13.915Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:28:24.514Z","user":{"userId":"795194683","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian M","accountLink":"/user/id/795194683"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Feel that the director likes to rehash storyline and tricks from this and other franchise's he has worked on.","displayName":"Joe S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:28:07.924Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:28:07.924Z","user":{"userId":"76354394-dacc-4d10-96f0-29c3671ea7dc","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joe S","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent conclusion to the Skywalker saga.","displayName":"Rich","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:28:07.570Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:28:07.570Z","user":{"userId":"646caeb5-a4a8-45dc-8333-490cba035e96","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rich","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I actually enjoyed it...
