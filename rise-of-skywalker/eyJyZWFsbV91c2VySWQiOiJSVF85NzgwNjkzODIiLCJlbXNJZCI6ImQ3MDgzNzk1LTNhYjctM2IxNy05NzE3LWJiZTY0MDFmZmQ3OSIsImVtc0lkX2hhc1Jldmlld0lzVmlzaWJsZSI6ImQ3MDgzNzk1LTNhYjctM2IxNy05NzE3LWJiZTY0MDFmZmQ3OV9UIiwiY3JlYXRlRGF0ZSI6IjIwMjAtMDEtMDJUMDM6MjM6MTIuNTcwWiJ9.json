The movie ends the continued questions that arise in the two previos movies and manages to deliver a somewhat satisfactory ending to the plot as a whole and to each of the different character arcs (Rey, Fin, you know...). In the end the movie manages to make me feel that it is indeed the end of the galaxies history, but we'll have to wait and see what Disney has to offer, if it comes, to continue with the story of the galaxy far, far away.","displayName":"Federico R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T03:23:02.933Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T03:23:02.933Z","user":{"userId":"978497488","realm":"RT","displayName":"Federico R","accountLink":"/user/id/978497488"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Disjointed, not as good as others","displayName":"Marcia F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T03:22:06.346Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T03:22:06.346Z","user":{"userId":"899dba7b-5fad-4fd4-baf7-06d8d78a14c6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Marcia F","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A solid conclusion that treats the old guard as the flawed heroes they are, while passing the mantle to the new generation.

Can't stop crying. They single handedly ruined the new Star Wars without thought or care to how they should have been. The originals were about hope, love, and how good prevails evil. All 3 of these new movies leaned on the bad winning, despair, and in the end, it left fans with NOTHING good to hold on to. Oh, and they basically did all the old movies in reverse and flipped them to the dark side. Those writers never deserve to have the honor of writing again. George Lucas, it hurts so bad. Please make it stop, I beg you.","displayName":"Cathleen S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1110241659/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T03:19:25.491Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T03:19:32.646Z","user":{"userId":"814388578","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cathleen S","accountLink":"/user/id/814388578"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"It didn't serve as a third film in a trilogy should.
