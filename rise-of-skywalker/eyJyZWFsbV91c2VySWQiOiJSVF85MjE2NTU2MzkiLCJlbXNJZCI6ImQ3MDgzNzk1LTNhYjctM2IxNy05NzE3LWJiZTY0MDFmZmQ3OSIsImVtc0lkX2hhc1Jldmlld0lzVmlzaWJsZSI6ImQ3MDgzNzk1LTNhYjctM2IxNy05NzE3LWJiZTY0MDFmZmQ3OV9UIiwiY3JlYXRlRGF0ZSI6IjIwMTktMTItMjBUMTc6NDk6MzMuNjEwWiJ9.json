I did not feel that this movie went out of it's way to retcon Rian Johnson (outside of one small scene).  If anything, JJ did his best to carry as much of that narrative forward as he could. It's definitely a bit of a narrative mess and has a lot of plot conveniences (a LOT).  BUT, it's a ton of fun, brings quite a bit of closure, and left me overall satisfied.","displayName":"Andrew W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1321637878/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:47:51.118Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:47:54.884Z","user":{"userId":"924563085","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew W","accountLink":"/user/id/924563085"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
