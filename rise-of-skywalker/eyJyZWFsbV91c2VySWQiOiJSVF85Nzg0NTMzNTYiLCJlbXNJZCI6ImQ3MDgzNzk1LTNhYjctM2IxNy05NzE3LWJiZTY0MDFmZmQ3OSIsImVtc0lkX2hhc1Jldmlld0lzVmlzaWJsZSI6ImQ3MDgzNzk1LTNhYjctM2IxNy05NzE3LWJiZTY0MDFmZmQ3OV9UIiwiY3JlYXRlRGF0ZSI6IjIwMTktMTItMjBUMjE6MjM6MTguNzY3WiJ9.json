Opening night left me a little sour with the fast pace, new force abilities, and amount of nostalgia. However, after a second viewing, I understand the direction of the film more, have learned new, small details I missed, and appreciate it so much more for what it is. The pace is a non issue the second time and lets you appreciate the fun ride this film is. It's a solid conclusion to my favorite franchise","displayName":"Davidson C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:23:05.566Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:23:07.188Z","user":{"userId":"976930492","realm":"RT","displayName":"Davidson C","accountLink":"/user/id/976930492"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Compared to the last movie my husband and I loved this movie.

The plot of this film is totally and utterly contrived in every sense and in every aspect from beginning to end. \"Forced\" being a keyword to describe how arbitrary plot devices are forced into the story, forcing the characters from A to B. Positives include: The relationship building between the main cast, the DM cinematography and JW score and the attempt at diverting from the upending of Rian Johnson's TLJ is welcomed. But, it is too late. Rather than pulling Star Wars up from that cliff edge JJ let it slip through his fingers - intentionally or accidentally. Maybe if he had control of the entire trilogy, at least it might have been a coherent mess. Ultimately, this film alters the Star Wars universe more than even TLJ. It undermines over 40 years of world building, law and lore that cannot and will not be undone. It is a shame, and a wasted opportunity.","displayName":"Kookie K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:22:52.548Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:22:57.731Z","user":{"userId":"978453104","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kookie K","accountLink":"/user/id/978453104"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"[SPOILERS] Wow, just wow this movie is so damn disappointing. I can't actually believe that this is the end to the skywalker saga. I feel like the whole Rey is a palpatine twist didn't belong in this movie and I felt like it was rushed they should have given more time to see how Rey faces the fact that she is related to palpatine, a lot like how we saw Luke face the fact that Darth Vader was his father. I also feel that Leia's death was just so anticlimactic and that the scene had no emotion at all. Oh and yeah how is palpatine still alive? Cause he doesn't seem to be a clone cause his body is being moved by some kind of machine, if he was a clone couldn't he just be able to walk normally; wait wouldn't he be younger too?
