Would have been better had they fleshed out more of the story as a two part finale over two movies instead of flushing it all in one. Overall I walked away from this film feeling satisfied as a Star Wars fan. Lots of powerful emotion - thanks to that John Williams score and some fan service that I appreciated.","displayName":"Neil G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157477943950090/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:27:13.398Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:27:26.124Z","user":{"userId":"978454279","realm":"RT","displayName":"Neil G","accountLink":"/user/id/978454279"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"First of all, dont listen to critics. The movie a lot fun and fans of Star Wars will be happy. However, the movie movies around a lot to different locations. It seems that J.J. was making two films. One focused on fixing the Star Wars movie and also focus on new material. There is a scene at the end movie that should have never existed.

He did the best he could with the pieces he got from the Last Jedi. Now that this trilogy is over it's very clear (and they have said in interviews) that there was no overarching plot set up when they started this trilogy. Not having a plot and going with different directors is what ended up making this last movie so...disjointed. It really feels like JJ is trying to stuff two movies worth of info into one and in the end the movie feels overstuffed, rushed, and nonsensical. It's no where near as bad as the Last Jedi, but I honestly probably won't watch it again for a very long time.","displayName":"Scott S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:27:00.533Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:27:11.626Z","user":{"userId":"978229661","realm":"RT","displayName":"Scott S","accountLink":"/user/id/978229661"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Too much going on, not great.","displayName":"Lucas H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/131531821635404/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:26:57.972Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:27:19.439Z","user":{"userId":"978454300","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lucas H","accountLink":"/user/id/978454300"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Very disappointing for hardcore fans, although casual audiences will love it.
