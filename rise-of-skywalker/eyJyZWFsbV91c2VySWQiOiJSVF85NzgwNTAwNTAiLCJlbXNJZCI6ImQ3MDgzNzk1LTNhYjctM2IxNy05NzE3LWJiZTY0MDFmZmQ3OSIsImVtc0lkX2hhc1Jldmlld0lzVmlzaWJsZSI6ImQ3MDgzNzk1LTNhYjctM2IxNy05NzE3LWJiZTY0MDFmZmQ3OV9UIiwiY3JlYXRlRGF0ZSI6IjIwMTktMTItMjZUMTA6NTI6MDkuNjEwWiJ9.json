Don't go in hating or with all of the judgment. Clear your mind and watch. Then see how it makes you feel.

The haters are pretentious knobs who just want to be controversial.","displayName":"Louise K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10159113334754308/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-26T10:51:02.886Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T10:51:17.155Z","user":{"userId":"978479533","realm":"RT","displayName":"Louise K","accountLink":"/user/id/978479533"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Been a fan of Star Wars since I was 5 years old and this trilogy finale was a fan's dream come true.
