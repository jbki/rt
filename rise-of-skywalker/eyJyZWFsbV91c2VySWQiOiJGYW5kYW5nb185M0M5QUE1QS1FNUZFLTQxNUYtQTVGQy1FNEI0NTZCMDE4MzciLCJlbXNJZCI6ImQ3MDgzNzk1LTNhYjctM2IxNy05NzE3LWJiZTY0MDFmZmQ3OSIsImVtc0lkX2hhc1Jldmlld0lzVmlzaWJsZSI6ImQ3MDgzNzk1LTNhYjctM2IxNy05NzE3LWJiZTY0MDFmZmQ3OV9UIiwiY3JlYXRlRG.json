Made me cry. This is true SW! It is worth to mention that as we reach the end we can see that JJ somewhat respected the cannon: of course with many changes, the main storyline of the expanded universe, previously approved by George Lucas as published in old books, was preserved. Congratulations Disney for this turning back from that piece of sh** wich was Episode VIII, the only SW film I just watched once and even regreted that. Episode IX, by its turn, is worth tears, makes us believe there is still hope in Star Wars universe, as long as Rian Johnson is not in charge of it.","displayName":"Cadu R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10211041506382080/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:12:43.751Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:12:56.933Z","user":{"userId":"976997565","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cadu R","accountLink":"/user/id/976997565"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"First, I loved the Force awakens, and I enjoyed the last Jedi, despite the terrible story Arc and the movie itself being generally irrelevant to the trilogy.   I'm also team Kylo from the beginning in part because I like the sith more than Jedi but also because Driver is a Marine.   \n\nNow that you know where my opinion is based, about the movie itself and then the trilogy as a whole.   Keeping in mind this is a Disney movie, certain things are expected, in your face light over darkness, the strength of kindness and compassion, how being kind to everyone and everything helps you, teamwork and people being people and togetherness.  It checked all the Disney boxes.\n\nIt was long.   Like it felt like two movies, but more on that in a minute.   If you have a little blatter don't drink anything for a couple hours preshow. The plot felt like a good ending to what started in the Force awakens.  Unfortunately there was some floundering in the story Arc in some of the first and nearly all of the second movie.  That left a lot of ground to cover to wrap things up in ep9.   That led to some \"that was to easy\" moments where characters just magically found what they needed to move forward.  But overall, I enjoyed it.  \n\nHad Disney had a single director (JJ, not Johnson), fleshed it out completely, streamlined ep7, split ep 9 in half and made the first part of 9 and the relevant parts of 8 one movie and extended the later part of 9.  The trilogy would've been amazing.  Overall as a fan, I can overlook 8 and enjoy the Star wars universe for what it is.  Thinking back from Anakin and his alleged miracle birth, also alleged that Palatine may have used the Force to create him.  The overall 9 episodes (minus ep8). Generally mesh together well as the story of bloodlines, dark vrs light, redemption for the unredeemable, and becoming who you want to be regardless of your birth.   \n\nMany people won't like 9 because it feels rushed, jumping from one thing to another with almost nonstop action.  Bear in mind though EP 9 is basically what 8 should have been and then EP 9.   Also the force abilities of certain characters are a bit much but considering the abilities of Nihilus and other major sith characters it's a thing I guess.  Also parts of the movie, take place in a Nexus so they are more powerful.   \n\nAll in all, could have, would have, should have been better but 8 made that nearly impossible.   9 was probably the best it could be considering what it had to work with.   I was satisfied with it.","displayName":"Adam P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1469396596562866/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:12:42.788Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:12:49.944Z","user":{"userId":"978453242","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adam P","accountLink":"/user/id/978453242"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"TFA and TLJ (both of which I didn’t care for, to be clear) painted this movie into a corner that was almost IMPOSSIBLE to get out of, something the internet’s made abundantly clear over the last two years or so. I’m not saying it was a perfect film, but, considering, they made about as satisfying a conclusion to the dumpster fire of the Sequel Trilogy as could be expected. I didn’t think this would be a flawless film, and it wasn’t one. If you go in with low expectations, you should have a blast.","displayName":"Isaac N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:12:27.270Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:12:27.270Z","user":{"userId":"E049F7DB-2367-4527-B8FA-F0CC011C9E75","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Isaac N","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The Movie was a failure from the opening crawl.","displayName":"Jonathan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:12:17.872Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:12:17.872Z","user":{"userId":"91659c18-75cf-4211-bd2a-8995b8824e62","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jonathan","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"It was a lackluster ending to a 42-year journey. They must have made a wrong turn at Albuquerque because this film was all over the map. There were some great set pieces and the cameos were almost the price of a matinee ticket, it was rushed and lacked focus. Basically, you can watch TFA and then skip straight to Rise of Skywalker, it basically crammed two films worth of plot into 2:15. Not bad, but really not worth the hype.","displayName":"Matthew S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2859822124036756/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:12:17.331Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:21:47.380Z","user":{"userId":"978453235","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew S","accountLink":"/user/id/978453235"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"When it wasn't trying to retcon all of the Last Jedi stuff, it was a lot of fun.","displayName":"Garrett H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/561706522/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:12:13.501Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:12:18.205Z","user":{"userId":"848985088","realm":"RT","displayName":"Garrett H","accountLink":"/user/id/848985088"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Had some flaws with pacing, sometimes a little wonky- but none the less, a great romp with my favorite characters old and new.
