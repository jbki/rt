They seem to be upset that the movie basically ignored and got rid of all the garbage and stupid plot devices from The Last Jedi (as evidenced because these same \"critics\" gave The Last Jedi a baffling 93%). \n\nIn reality, Abrams did an unreal job of pulling the story back together to somewhat being cohesive—ditching Rian Johnson's dumpster fire of ‘subverting expectations'. \n\nLightsaber battles, great special effects, easy on the CGI, nostalgic homages and throwbacks to the series.... along with some surprises and twists along the way bring this story full circle to a fitting and appropriate end. \n\nMy only complaint is that Abrams didn't get to do the last movie as well, as that would have allowed for some of the plot devices to be explored a bit more instead of having to wast time backtracking and undoing the absolute stupidity of The Last Jedi. \n\nThankfully Rose is basically written out of the script a la Jar Jar Binks style, and redemption is found for some of the other characters Rian Johnson ruined. Listen to the fans on this one and go see it!","displayName":"Jon K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10156668809753244/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T05:55:35.213Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T05:58:01.554Z","user":{"userId":"977351191","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jon K","accountLink":"/user/id/977351191"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A nice ending to the Skywalker Saga.
