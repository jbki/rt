A complete cash grab that didn't add anything to the story. I was holding out that this movie would tie everything together and make the other two necessary for this grand finale, but it was a complete let down. I will say that I started to care about the new characters a little bit in this one, but C-3PO had the best performance. That should tell you something.

I had fun and enjoyed the lore expansion - but it's obvious that J.J had to \"clean up\" after Ryan Johnson who just drop all the things J.J set up in the force awakens. Therefore the opening becomes rushed and the movie seems a little cramed.\n\nBut i feel J.J finally made an ending that fine, nothing revolutionary but fine.","displayName":"Lasse K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10152178817444388/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:16:28.616Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:16:35.734Z","user":{"userId":"972857806","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lasse K","accountLink":"/user/id/972857806"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is everything that a devoted Star Wars fan would want to end the masterful saga.
