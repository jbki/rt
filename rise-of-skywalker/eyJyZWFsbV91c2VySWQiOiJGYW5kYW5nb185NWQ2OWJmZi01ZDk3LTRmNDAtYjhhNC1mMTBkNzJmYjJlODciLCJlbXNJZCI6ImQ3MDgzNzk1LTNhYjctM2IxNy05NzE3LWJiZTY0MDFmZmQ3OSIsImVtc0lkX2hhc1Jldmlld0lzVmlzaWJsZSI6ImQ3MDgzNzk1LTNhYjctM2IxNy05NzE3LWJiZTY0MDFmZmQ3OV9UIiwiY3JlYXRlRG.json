Each scene was more preposterous than the last. The plot was convoluted. The acting was terrible. The Jedi powers were made up to support \"what just happened and why\" plot points. My 16 year old son walked out telling me that he never wants to see another Star Wars movie again and he doesn't get why I took him with me. I always go to movies with the belief that it has to be seen for what it purports to be and suspend my disbelief. It was impossible to enjoy!","displayName":"Jonathan K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:33:46.705Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:33:46.705Z","user":{"userId":"978466220","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonathan K","accountLink":"/user/id/978466220"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Good movie, can't deny, but could be better if someone teached rey actress how to fight any kind of martial art, everything else is ok thumbs up!","displayName":"Neto C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:33:46.653Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:33:55.686Z","user":{"userId":"975571124","realm":"RT","displayName":"Neto C","accountLink":"/user/id/975571124"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"I thought the carpet on the theatre floor was more entertaining. I had given up on these movies quite a while ago, and thought okay, it's the last one, here's hoping. Someone else mentioned cheesy. I think that's best description. I was laughing out loud at so many cheesy, MSG-laden ridiculously written and poorly acted scenes. The last third of the movie improved marginally enough to make me not regret actually walking out. I'd still rather have had that time back in my life and would have preferred watching it as a background movie on TV so I could be doing something more entertaining, like reading a book. Amazing to me how, The Expanse, a TV series, can so completely blow this dated attempt at SyFy out of the water with no comparison. They could have done a lot better with all that money and tech.","displayName":"Teresa M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:32:43.966Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:33:00.410Z","user":{"userId":"978265120","realm":"RT","displayName":"Teresa M","accountLink":"/user/id/978265120"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Definitely worth seeing but the ending left me sad.
