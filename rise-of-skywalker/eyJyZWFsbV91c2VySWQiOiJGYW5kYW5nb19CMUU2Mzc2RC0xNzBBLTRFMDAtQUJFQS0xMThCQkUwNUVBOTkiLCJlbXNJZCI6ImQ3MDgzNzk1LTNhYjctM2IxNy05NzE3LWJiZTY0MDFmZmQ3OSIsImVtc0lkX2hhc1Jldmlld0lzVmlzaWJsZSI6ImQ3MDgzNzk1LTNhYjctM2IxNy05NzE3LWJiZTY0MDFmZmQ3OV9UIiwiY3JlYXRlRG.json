I wanted to love it, the first time I saw it I was completely locked in trying to not miss anything...and its just not a movie that rewards you for paying attention.\n\nCould almost feel the screenwriters trying to please the fans, as opposed to telling a compelling story.  It tried to have emotional moments without actually following through on any real tragedy.  The return of an old supposedly-dead villain was...pointless and unexplained.  The twists were the same - running back to the safety of old ideas without adding any new fresh emotional context.\n\nJust a complete mess, and singlehandedly took the Star Wars franchise off of the \"Must See in Theaters\" list for me until further notice.","displayName":"Danny P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T02:59:00.475Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T02:59:00.475Z","user":{"userId":"976510368","realm":"RT","displayName":"Danny P","accountLink":"/user/id/976510368"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The family and I watch this final of the original episodes.
