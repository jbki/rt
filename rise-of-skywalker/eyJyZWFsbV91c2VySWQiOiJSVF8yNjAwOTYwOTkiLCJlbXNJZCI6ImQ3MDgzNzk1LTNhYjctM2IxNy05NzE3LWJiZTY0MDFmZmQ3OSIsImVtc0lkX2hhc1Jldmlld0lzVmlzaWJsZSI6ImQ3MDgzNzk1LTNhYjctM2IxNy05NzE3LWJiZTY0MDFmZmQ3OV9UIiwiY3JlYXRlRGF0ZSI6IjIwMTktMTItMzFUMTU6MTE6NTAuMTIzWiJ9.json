The movie was great! Abrams did an amazing job with the film. Yes its probably a little different than what George Lucas would probably do, but the movie still hit all the right spots for me when it comes to Star Wars.","displayName":"Jathan R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T15:11:46.471Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T15:11:46.471Z","user":{"userId":"1a0aaf77-4701-497e-8e78-64b048ff1e6b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jathan R","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was great and it ended better than I thought it would.","displayName":"Michael P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T15:11:45.311Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T15:11:45.311Z","user":{"userId":"2f38e3fe-b42f-4351-b39b-78e8c0e17eeb","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael P","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Gives meaning to the sequel trilogy and ties all the movies together.","displayName":"BombadCoder","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T15:11:31.373Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T15:11:31.373Z","user":{"userId":"1ac43b0f-6b5a-4641-a162-0f7c38719b21","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"BombadCoder","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I'm a Star Wars fan so I liked it a lot. I think the director did a great job telling another Star Wars story. The struggles and character development were exactly as I would have hoped for the end of the saga. The environments were deep and interesting as expected. I loved the work done on the background aliens, which I'm always looking for, I was super happy to see the Ewoks again. Overall really fun to watch and I'll be buying it for the collection.","displayName":"Rebecca","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T15:11:23.519Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T15:11:23.519Z","user":{"userId":"a889838d-452d-47de-a758-c6d8510bfa43","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rebecca","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Story was great.
