Are the first 30 minutes of this film jarringly fast-paced? Yes. Are there a few moments in the film that happen because the plot needs them to? Yes. But both of those issues were created by The Last Jedi, and Rise of Skywalker did its best to fix everything ruined by that film. \n\nThis film is a Star Wars film, which is more than I can say about half of Disney's attempts - Solo, and Last Jedi. \n\nMy Tentative Score: B/B- \n\nI will update this review after my second viewing, and maybe again after a third.","displayName":"Alex W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:11:09.948Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:11:11.983Z","user":{"userId":"978436708","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex W","accountLink":"/user/id/978436708"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"LOVED it!!
