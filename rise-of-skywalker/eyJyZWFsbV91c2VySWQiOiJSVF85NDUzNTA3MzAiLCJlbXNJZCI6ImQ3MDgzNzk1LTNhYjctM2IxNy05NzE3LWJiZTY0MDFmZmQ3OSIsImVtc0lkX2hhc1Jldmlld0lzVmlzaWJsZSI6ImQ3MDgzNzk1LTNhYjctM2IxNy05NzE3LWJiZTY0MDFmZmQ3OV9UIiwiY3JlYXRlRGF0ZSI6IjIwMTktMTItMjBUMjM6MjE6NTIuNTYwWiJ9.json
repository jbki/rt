Had a lot of nostalgic nods, answered most of our questions and tied up loose ends. Thought it was the best movie of the trilogy. I wish it explained more back story of the Sith but that is my only complaint. I think many people will not be happy because its Star Wars and no matter what they do or how they make the film will not live up to the ideal their head. Disney did a good job. Go into the movie with real expectations.","displayName":"Jennifer F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:21:33.728Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:21:33.728Z","user":{"userId":"d9816d79-336d-44ae-be64-8060065a1d84","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jennifer F","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I felt anger, watching this convoluted plot hole ridden film.  Sure it's flashy and has a semblance of Good ideas, Yet does nothing with them.  As a star wars fan my disappointment was far beyond even the sith.  There is almost no imagination heart or soul, Just nostalgia but done poorly. The film and even the disney trilogy have no semblance of identity just re imagining. To me this is not star wars it's fan fiction.","displayName":"Aiden M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000554880389/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:21:24.531Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:21:30.862Z","user":{"userId":"914001295","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aiden M","accountLink":"/user/id/914001295"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Breathtaking at so many moments.
