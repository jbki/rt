It retreads familiar ground that we have seen before, many times. The storyline with Rey and Kylo Ren, such as it is, comes to a predictable end with a more or less satisfying close, with JJ Abrams rubbing his lens flare stink on everything. That aside, the real value Star Wars is in the theatrical experience that Lucasfilm faithfully delivers—the sets, costumes, special effects and sound are all top notch. See it, if only to pay one last nostalgic tribute to George Lucas' cinematic legacy.","displayName":"Jesse B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T05:30:54.946Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T05:30:54.946Z","user":{"userId":"5a311ae6-d2ee-4dd8-9c07-1bb64eb77108","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jesse B","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great story, fun, a little disjointed at times.","displayName":"Carto","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T05:28:36.274Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T05:28:36.274Z","user":{"userId":"405c61d3-20d3-4d07-8330-84f632ab3160","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Carto","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I enjoyed this movie more than it's predecessor but not as much as the Force Awakens.
