I almost always know that if I do opposite of what the critics say, I will see a good movie. Rise of Skywalker was a fast paced, action packed movie that was a million times better than the Last Jedi. See it, you won't be dissapointed.","displayName":"Travis B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T18:37:17.498Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T18:37:28.983Z","user":{"userId":"977703299","realm":"RT","displayName":"Travis B","accountLink":"/user/id/977703299"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A lovely end of the saga looking forward to what's next","displayName":"Rodger S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T18:36:08.558Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T18:36:08.558Z","user":{"userId":"C6FD795B-BBDF-4F3A-B0D0-0426AED02BCE","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rodger S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"So much to love about this movie!!

When episode one debut I took my son! It has been a personal and family affair to follow the saga of Star Wars for over 40 years! When you get to my age at 62, and see the passing of the saga heroes, the clock of time starts ticking louder! This film meant more to me than anything that would be rated strictly from a film standpoint.","displayName":"mjvr2c","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T18:34:47.435Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T22:05:33.464Z","user":{"userId":"02c7e14d-30c3-4ead-ba96-6081012a27f9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"mjvr2c","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was a nice closure of the Skywalker storyline.","displayName":"Skew Baby","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T18:34:43.824Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T18:34:43.824Z","user":{"userId":"6CF22D69-208B-4B8D-87CA-B194D485C3C6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Skew Baby","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved the story.
