Now it absolutely could've been better, but with the unfortunate passing of Carrie Fisher, they did the best that they could do, and I was honestly worried because of her passing, and I'm nothing short of impressed with how they filled it.","displayName":"Gabriel D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2491588917796077/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:57:49.449Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:57:59.060Z","user":{"userId":"978466568","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gabriel D","accountLink":"/user/id/978466568"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"EXCELLENT!

JJ and Chris Terrio failed in nearly every aspect in this movie's screenplay, a movie that is basically a large exposition dump that makes not a lick of sense. It pained me to watch this. I wanted to like it very much, i hoped the critics were wrong. But the entire film i found myself facepalming over how ridiculous, corny, and dissapointing it was from beginning to end. Ian McDiarmid is the standout (as expected) and once again shines in a turd of a movie. The actors did their jobs well all around, and there were some really good looking scenes and setpieces here and there, but ultimately fail to hold up the baffling story and direction. Sorry what they did to your ideas George Lucas.","displayName":"Jared K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:57:39.315Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:57:39.315Z","user":{"userId":"978466518","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jared K","accountLink":"/user/id/978466518"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Thank you for fixing the last movie!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:57:29.015Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:57:29.015Z","user":{"userId":"974932878","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/974932878"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Phenomenal.
