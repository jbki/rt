I found it quite enjoyable and look forward to rewatching it.","displayName":"Lindsey M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10107343626196092/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:18:20.994Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:18:30.193Z","user":{"userId":"978466667","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lindsey M","accountLink":"/user/id/978466667"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good ending for the sequel trilogy.
