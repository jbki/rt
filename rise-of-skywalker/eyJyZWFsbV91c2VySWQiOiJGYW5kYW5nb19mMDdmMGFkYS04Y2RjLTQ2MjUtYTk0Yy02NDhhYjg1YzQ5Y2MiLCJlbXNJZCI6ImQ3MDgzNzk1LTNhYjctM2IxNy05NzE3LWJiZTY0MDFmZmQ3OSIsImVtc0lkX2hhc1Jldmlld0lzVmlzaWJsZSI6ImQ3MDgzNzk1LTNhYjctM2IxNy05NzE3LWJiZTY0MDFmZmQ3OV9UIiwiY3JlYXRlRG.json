It was a great ending - especially, given the fact they didn't pre-write all three movies in the third trilogy. They wrapped it all up nicely. My main complaint was that there was just too much going on, so things moved at too frenetic a pace. But, that happens when you don't write them all ahead of time.","displayName":"Matt M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/36604526/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:43:23.379Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:43:33.464Z","user":{"userId":"802487279","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt M","accountLink":"/user/id/802487279"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Im still contemplating how bad this film (and naturally in turn the disney SW trilogy) truly is. You find yourself questioning many moments throughout as it fails to draw you in while simultaneously insulting your intelligence even in a film universe where suspension of disbelief has already been established.\nIm truly astonished at how poor the story telling is (if you could say there was any at all). Its basically a series of unbelievable action scenes strung together with a plot that appears written an hour before they began shooting.","displayName":"Luke C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10162710343930440/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:42:55.307Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:43:02.546Z","user":{"userId":"978489783","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luke C","accountLink":"/user/id/978489783"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Meh. Thoroughly mediocre, with nothing at all new, interesting or surprising to say. Lots of \"greatest hits\" moments, lots of emotional manipulation without evoking any genuine emotion. I was mostly bored when I wasn't annoyed with characters acting stupid or immature. The previous installment was a much better movie -- at least it was trying to add something new to the SW universe, not just more of the same old same old that's been repeating itself for 40 years. This one, I've already mostly forgotten.","displayName":"benbenberi","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:41:46.664Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:41:46.664Z","user":{"userId":"d805c1dd-c1c0-4b8a-aa5b-41bb0b527e2e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"benbenberi","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"More action than the last one, excellent movie","displayName":"Josh","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:41:21.954Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:41:21.954Z","user":{"userId":"5e933b7a-86a1-46eb-8d9c-ca68574a5aa4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Josh","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is made for the Star Wars fans who love the original and prequel series, go in to this movie looking to have fun and for an amazing journey and you won't be disappointed.","displayName":"Yahsu S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2630622810301758/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:41:14.907Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:41:22.869Z","user":{"userId":"978195113","realm":"RT","displayName":"Yahsu S","accountLink":"/user/id/978195113"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"}]}
