Special effects on top the game as usual......but.... as a Star Wars fan I wasn't pleased at all with the twist! The story is supposed to be of the Skywalker family.

I was one of those disappointed by TLJ.  There were moments in this movie that I loved and moments that made me go \"wtf\" and at one point I laughed out loud during what was not a funny moment.  I just found it to be ridiculous and the laugh just spilled out of me.  \n\nWas this a glorious end to the Skywalker Saga?  No, but it is passable after you've thought about it and discussed it with friends.  It is not the dumpster fire that others are making it out to be.  \n\nThe cast were great, but adding so many new characters to the last chapter of this trilogy was maybe not the best idea.  I'd watch it again.","displayName":"Louvia L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:23:37.587Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:23:37.587Z","user":{"userId":"a8df761d-3fe0-4b0b-a0b8-ea519466a560","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Louvia L","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was ok, they closed this chapter.
