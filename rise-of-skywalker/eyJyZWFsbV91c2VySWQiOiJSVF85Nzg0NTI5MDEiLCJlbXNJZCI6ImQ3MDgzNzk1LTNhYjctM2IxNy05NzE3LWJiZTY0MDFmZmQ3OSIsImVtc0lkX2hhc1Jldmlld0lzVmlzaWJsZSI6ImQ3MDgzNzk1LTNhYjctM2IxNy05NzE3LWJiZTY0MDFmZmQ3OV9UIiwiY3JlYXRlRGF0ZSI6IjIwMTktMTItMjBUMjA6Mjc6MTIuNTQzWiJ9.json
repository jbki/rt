So much could have been done, but despite too much content, nothing is truly resolved. There's no balance in the force, no explanation of how Palpatine survived or who the Knights of Ren were, or Poe's background or even Fin's for that matter. Even though Rey's family history was revealed, it wasn't fleshed out which is kind of how the whole movie went, everything that happened was glossed over very quickly. Rose was insultingly sidelined (ghosted would probably be a better term for what JJ did to her) & the new characters were so short on screen time that they still felt like strangers by the end.  All the way through it felt like a slight attempt to recreate ROTJ but the end made it clear that's exactly what it was, thereby removing the new identity this trilogy had been carving for itself. What was truly unforgivable for me was what JJ did to Kylo at the end, it was needless & pandering to the old fan base whilst ignoring the new.","displayName":"Jessy S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2056479434426047/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:27:10.509Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T23:40:44.724Z","user":{"userId":"977005404","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jessy S","accountLink":"/user/id/977005404"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Epic conclusion to the Skywalker Saga!

Point blank. There were so many loose ends, we DON'T know what Finn wanted to tell Rey when they thought they were going to die, we know Rey is a Palpatine but it would've been good to get a background of her actual parents. Kylo Ren should've survived...him and Rey joining forces would've lend for a stronger conclusion. \n\nAnd, since now Kylo is passed on...it would've been MORE POWERFUL that Solo and Ren join Luke and Leia in that last scene force ghost reunion, that would've spoken more of \"family\". \n\nThis movie gets me to doubt that the producer was solid on her objective to portray not only the issue of finding yourself, but also of the issue of honoring the past movies before. \n\nIt wasn't completely terrible, but not the story line or ending that would hold weight for me. I still think the original trillogy was way better.","displayName":"Alexandria L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/572041109641642/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:26:56.248Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:27:12.568Z","user":{"userId":"975036548","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alexandria L","accountLink":"/user/id/975036548"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Plot hole after plot hole, such a waste and so disappointed","displayName":"Andy H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:26:53.096Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:26:59.024Z","user":{"userId":"977271049","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andy H","accountLink":"/user/id/977271049"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Force awakens and last jedi had a better opening scene. this opening scene was worrisome. all over the place. and too many character at once. it made the dialogue obviously bad. previous supporting characters were insignificant and the new characters had no purpose.
