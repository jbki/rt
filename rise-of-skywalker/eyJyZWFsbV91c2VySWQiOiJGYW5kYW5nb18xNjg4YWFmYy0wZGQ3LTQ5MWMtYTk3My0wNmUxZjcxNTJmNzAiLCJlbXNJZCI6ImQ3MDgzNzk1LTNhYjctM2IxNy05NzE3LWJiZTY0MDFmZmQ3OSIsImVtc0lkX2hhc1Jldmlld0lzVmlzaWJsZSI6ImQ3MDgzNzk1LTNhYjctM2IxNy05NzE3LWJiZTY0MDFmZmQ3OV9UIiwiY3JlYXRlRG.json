Which, as a Star Wars fan, I really appreciate. It's essence is all Star Wars, as it is the culmination And climax of all previous Star Wars stories. All in all, this goes down as one of my favorite Star Wars stories. Now that I think about it, it might be my Most favorite.","displayName":"Zach F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/213711436313521/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:42:45.601Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:48:55.439Z","user":{"userId":"978460951","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zach F","accountLink":"/user/id/978460951"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I've had a lot of emotions about this one.  I left feeling that the movie did what it could to wrap up the saga in the restraints put on it by both Disney and pressure from fans to 'fix' Last Jedi.  There was a lot of action, the CGI was amazing in IMAX 3D and a lot of throw back references to the original series.  I laughed several times and there was an endearing charm to many moments, which is then balanced out by a new level of sinister/ominous moments every time Palpatine is on the screen.  I appreciate that they tried their best with the Leia scenes, yet it felt contrived, choppy and awkward.  \n\nI am trying to fight this internal urge to measure a movies worth by it having a happy ending.  Star Wars has never been Star Trek, it is hardly a utopia so its inherent darkness leaves several of the movies ending in a way that seems more of a stalemate than a true happy ending.  The force is balanced and yet this doesn't seem to be a deserving ending to the Skywalker Saga.  The whole thing is painfully tragic.  There doesn't seem to be any kind of justification for the suffering the Skywalker's had to endure.  I personally watch movies like this to escape the truths of harsh realities, but not everyone is like that and so my issues with the movie will not be everyone's.\n\nThe movie itself was entertaining.  The movie's place in the saga wraps things up.  The movie, however, has tainted the journey as a whole, making me feel unsettled about the story in a way that makes me wish episodes 7-9 just never existed.\n\nI could go on about more polarizing issues but this is my first review on this forum.  There is so much to unpack.  Also as a disclaimer, I was a Reylo Shipper so that may make my opinion on the whole thing a little less credible to some of you ;)","displayName":"Katrina W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10162659699410556/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:42:43.570Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:12:18.251Z","user":{"userId":"978460581","realm":"RT","displayName":"Katrina W","accountLink":"/user/id/978460581"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I really enjoyed the movie.
