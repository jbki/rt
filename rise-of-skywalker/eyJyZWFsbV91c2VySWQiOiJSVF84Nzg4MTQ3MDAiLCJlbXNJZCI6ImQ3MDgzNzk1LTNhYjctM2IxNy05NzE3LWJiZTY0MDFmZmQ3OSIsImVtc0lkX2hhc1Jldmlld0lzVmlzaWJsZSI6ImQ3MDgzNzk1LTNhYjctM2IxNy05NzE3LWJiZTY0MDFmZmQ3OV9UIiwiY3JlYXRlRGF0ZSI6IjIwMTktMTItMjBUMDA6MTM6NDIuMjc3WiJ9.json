However saying that as a big fan of the franchise I found the movie to be quite enjoyable and good to pass the time. Also Daisey Ridley and Adam Driver gave really good performances with what they were givem. But as a final chapter of a 42 year old saga, it doesn't really touch the feels where it should.","displayName":"Josh H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:12:36.854Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:21:24.170Z","user":{"userId":"978440801","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josh H","accountLink":"/user/id/978440801"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"I went in with no expectations and came out with a \"oh well\" feeling. As a EU/Legend fan I can follow these new force powers that are learned, but how exactly are they learned? \nThe movie is a mess and the sequel feels like two children fighting over a toy, which clearly also become obvious. \nJ.J. are literally giving multiple middelfingers to Ryan throughout the movie.\n\nPalpatine didn't die. No way he is dead. \nIt was so poorly executed and ruined the meaning of the first 6 films in the saga.\n\n1 star for the visual effects and 1 star for J.J. having to fix Ryan's bad decisions, though that shouldn't justify what has been done.","displayName":"Kim D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10219223531892042/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:12:21.523Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:14:51.293Z","user":{"userId":"978442288","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kim D","accountLink":"/user/id/978442288"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Fun, albeit very rushed movie.

Director JJ had a lot to clean up, (from episode VIII) and given the enormity of the task, did deliver a reasonable film to satisfy most StarWars fans.  For my personal taste, cinematography with its FX was compelling for a space-fantasy film, not too much to overstimulate the sensors, just the right amount. The actors performance, was great, Adam Driver in particular, exceptional.","displayName":"Genaro C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/540893312/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:11:36.473Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:12:00.433Z","user":{"userId":"913292152","realm":"RT","displayName":"Genaro C","accountLink":"/user/id/913292152"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"For the finale of Star Wars, lackluster can't describe it enough without spoiling the 'plot'. It brings beloved roles to little more than cheap tropes, just shadows of the legacy George Lucas has brought my (and many others) childhood. It shows poor treatment of not only the original cast, but it's own characters' main arcs are just completely ignored. The key points in the sequels that brings the dislike and heated debates are culminated in this film. It's a clear Disney princess story and nothing more.","displayName":"Chris S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:11:10.502Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:11:10.502Z","user":{"userId":"978442294","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris S","accountLink":"/user/id/978442294"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great star wars movie.","displayName":"Jose V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:10:11.253Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:10:20.413Z","user":{"userId":"976935389","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jose V","accountLink":"/user/id/976935389"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"First things first, this movie is not perfect. \nNor is much of it logical when you look more deeply into it. But honestly, if you are coming to Star Wars looking for logic, you're looking in the wrong place. \n\nStar Wars is as a crazy, wild, magical franchise about good space wizards fighting evil space wizards (let's be honest that's what it can be boiled down to). \n\nThis movie does an excellent job with the hand it was given, which considering the reception of the previous movie was not an easy one. Most of the emotional beats land, characters are expanded upon, questions are answered and most of the action is superbly filmed. Adam Drivers performance in this movie is also a stand out by far.\n\nSo, to summarise. If you are open minded and approach this movie in acceptance that it is a STAR WARS movie, you will find a film that delicately explores the line between good and evil and provides a very satisfactory ending to this popular franchise. If you don't, well enjoy hating on a movie that truly doesn't deserve alot of the hate it has and will undoubtedly receive.","displayName":"Megan S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1969615489741243/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:09:58.294Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:10:04.069Z","user":{"userId":"977610797","realm":"RT","displayName":"Megan S","accountLink":"/user/id/977610797"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Yes it was a bit rushed, unfortunately the Last Jedi threw away what was to be a story arc, and tried to finish the trilogy on the 2nd movie.\nThis one had to make up time in the 1st half to get the story back on track.\nMany WOW moments and teary moments. Action packed and truly worthy of the Star Wars Name.
