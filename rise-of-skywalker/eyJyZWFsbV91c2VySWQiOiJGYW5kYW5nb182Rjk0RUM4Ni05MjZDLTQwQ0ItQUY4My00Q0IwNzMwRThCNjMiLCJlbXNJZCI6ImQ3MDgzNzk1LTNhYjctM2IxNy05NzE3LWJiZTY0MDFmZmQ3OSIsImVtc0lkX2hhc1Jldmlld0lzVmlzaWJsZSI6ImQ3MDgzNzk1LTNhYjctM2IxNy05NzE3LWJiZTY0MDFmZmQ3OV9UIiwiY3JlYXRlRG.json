I didn't have high expectations from the start having seen what Disney and Rian Johnson did to the previous movies. This served me well as I found the Rise of Skywalker to be quite disappointing in terms of storyline, consistency and its ability to explain itself within the Star Wars universe and its link to Canon.\n\nThankfully I didn't waste any of my own money to watch this movie, though it sadly is time that I'll never get back.\n\nThis is a real disappointing ending to watch could've been a great trilogy of movies had Disney not destroyed it and for that I blame George Lucas for selling the rights without condition.","displayName":"Mat S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10158033514055208/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T05:44:50.641Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T05:44:57.509Z","user":{"userId":"978497744","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mat S","accountLink":"/user/id/978497744"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Rise of Skywalker uses nostalgia and a broom with a dustpan to be rid of the last jedis misdeeds. All the while introducing new characters for the 3rd movie in a row whose names you'll forget 4 seconds once they're off screen. One story arc on particular does stand out and felt real and believable; while another character continues to have no flaws, problems, or hero's journey. The scenery and atmosphere continue to amaze in certain moments but is drowned out by a forgetful 2 hour scavenger hunt. Most 5 star reviews seem to be fans that don't want to be honest that this trilogy will be forgotten and not count as canon star wars films in the years to come.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T05:44:18.771Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T05:46:01.814Z","user":{"userId":"260349620","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260349620"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"it's a fun movie but it could be better because the script is not well developed","displayName":"Renan A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2933919079953495/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T05:44:14.262Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T05:44:24.344Z","user":{"userId":"978497747","realm":"RT","displayName":"Renan A","accountLink":"/user/id/978497747"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Feels like what should’ve been of episode 8 and 9, smashed into one.
