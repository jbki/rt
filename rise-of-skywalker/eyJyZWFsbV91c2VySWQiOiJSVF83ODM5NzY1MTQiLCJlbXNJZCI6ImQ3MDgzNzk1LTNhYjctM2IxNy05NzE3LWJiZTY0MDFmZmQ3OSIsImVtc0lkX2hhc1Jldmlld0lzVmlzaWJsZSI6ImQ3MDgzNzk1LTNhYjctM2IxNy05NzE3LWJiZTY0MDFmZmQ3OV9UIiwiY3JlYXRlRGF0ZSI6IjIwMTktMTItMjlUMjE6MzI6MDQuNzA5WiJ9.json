Very sloppy and lazy writing. Massive plotholes the ruined the immersion of the film. It was the equivalent of doing a presentation the night before it was due and asking your friend for help that took the class five years ago and got a C. Overall, some arcs were resolved. Many were forgotten. Very disappointing, but a relief that this is over.","displayName":"Joseph A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/565863218/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T21:31:38.669Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T21:33:29.977Z","user":{"userId":"789815687","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph A","accountLink":"/user/id/789815687"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"absolutely loved it!","displayName":"JENNIFER M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T21:30:59.180Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T21:30:59.180Z","user":{"userId":"6A9B59DD-3E18-448E-987A-708D9BC633A2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"JENNIFER M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I liked how they tied up a lot of loose ends.
