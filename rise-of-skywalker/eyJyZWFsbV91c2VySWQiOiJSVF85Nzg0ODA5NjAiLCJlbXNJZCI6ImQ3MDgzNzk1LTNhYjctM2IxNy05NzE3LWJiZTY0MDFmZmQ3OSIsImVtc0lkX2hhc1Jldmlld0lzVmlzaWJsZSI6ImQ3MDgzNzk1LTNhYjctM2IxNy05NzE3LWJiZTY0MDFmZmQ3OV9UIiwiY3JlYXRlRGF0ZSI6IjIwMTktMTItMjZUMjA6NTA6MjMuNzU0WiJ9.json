The characters of Han, Luke, and Leia were represented well and their legacy was part of a satisfying ending.  However, the story of the relationship between Rey and Ren was more confusing than satisfying.  Their connection was displayed as supernatural, yet it turns out they aren't even related?!  It would have been better if it turned out that they were brother and sister.  Then, the scene where Rey lies dead and Ren comes back to life to save her, then Ren dies was just forced.  The ending felt rushed and predictable.","displayName":"Dawn M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T20:49:28.477Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T20:49:28.477Z","user":{"userId":"43e3f9d7-7239-4f5c-9090-8582c7e68119","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dawn M","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"As a stand alone movie, it's weak. As the conclusion to a trilogy or a trio or trilogies, so so disappointing. The plot is unimaginative, the script/acting are awful. The absence of a overarching plot connecting the three new movies, let alone the other installments, is painfully obvious. The Marvel franchise has raised the bar of what audiences expect from movie series. I just wanted it to end.","displayName":"David B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T20:48:41.823Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T20:48:51.506Z","user":{"userId":"975552935","realm":"RT","displayName":"David B","accountLink":"/user/id/975552935"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I thought the movie would be boring because of how long it was but I was wrong this movie is great and it is action pack.

The previous Episodes 7 & 8, ruined beloved characters, such as Luke Skywalker & Han Solo.  They also threw the Force \"Rules\", created by George Lucas, out the window, by giving the Rey character instant high-level Force powers & abilities, all without the training and experience necessary to become a strong Jedi, according to Lucas' 6 prior movies.  This movie, by bringing back The Emperor, ruins both Luke Skywalker's & Darth Vader's character arcs.  Their sacrifice was now for nothing, since they apparently didn't defeat the Emperor.  So only super-powered Rey can do it 30 years later.  It was just stupid and insulting.  The stand-alone films, Rogue One, and Solo, were pretty good though.","displayName":"steven s","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T20:47:03.182Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T20:47:03.182Z","user":{"userId":"0c085f73-fdbd-4cd0-ba79-0ee6449e2a44","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"steven s","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"I felt like they tried to cram in too much.
