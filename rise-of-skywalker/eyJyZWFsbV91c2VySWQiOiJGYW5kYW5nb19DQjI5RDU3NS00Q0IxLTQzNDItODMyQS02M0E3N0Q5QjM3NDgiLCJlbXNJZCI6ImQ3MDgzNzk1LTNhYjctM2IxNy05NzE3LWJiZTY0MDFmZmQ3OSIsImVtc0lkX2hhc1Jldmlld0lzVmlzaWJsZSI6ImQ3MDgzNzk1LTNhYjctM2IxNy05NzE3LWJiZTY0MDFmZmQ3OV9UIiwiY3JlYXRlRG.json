But a few things I felt amiss\nSpoiler alert\nI feel like they hinted that rey might use a staff version of lighsaber like darth maul's  ie during the training she was more comfortable to use her staff than lightsaber and acquiring leia and luke lightsaber, can combine both, but was ultimately ignored. Still confuse as in why they hinted possible  love triangle between rose, rey and the storm trooper guy but was ultimately ignored with no resolution..

In a world where you will never please everybody, The Rise of Skywalker exceeded my expectations, grabbed my attention from the first to the last scene and even extracted my tears.
