That is unprecedented for any Star Wars film and goes to show the absence of any hype for this movie.\n\nThis deflated hype is expected, the poor reception for The Last Jedi, the commercial failure of Solo and the slew of bad press surrounding this movie left everyone with a sour taste in their mouths for Disney Star Wars. Regardless, I took the 11:59 PM showing mainly to get it out of my system.\n\nThe main question on everyone's mind is: \"Would this be as bad as The Last Jedi?\". The answer is \"No\".\n\nIts a lot worse.\n\nIn comparison, The Last Jedi was a masterpiece. It had a cohesive and unique plot with a sense of urgency showed on-screen, a variety of cool and memorable scenes, strong themes throughout, character development (for better or worse) and a resonant message at the end. The Rise of Skywalker had none of these.\n\nWhen Kathleen Kennedy said that making the sequel trilogy was difficult because there was no source material to work with, I didn't expect her to take a trip to fanfiction.net for inspiration. Because everything that happens in this movie feels like its from a bad fanfic. There's no character development at all, no sense of progression, characters spout exposition as their only lines of dialogue and Force powers are thrown around willy-nilly.\n\nI'm going to venture into spoiler territory, so stop reading if you don't want any.\n\nThe movie starts of jarringly, with a transmission from Palpatine getting everyone's attention. If you didn't watch any of the trailers and didn't keep up with the marketing, this is completely out of left field. Palpatine was not hinted as returning in the other two movies and it already feels forced. It should also be worth noting that the transmission itself isn't in the movie (its in the Fortnite tie-in).\n\nPalpatine's presence in the movie serves two purposes, taking away the spot of main bad guy from Kylo Ren and giving Rey a lineage. Both of which were points we were left on in The Last Jedi. And it completely undermines the point of that movie, namely, that it doesn't matter what your lineage is, you are defined by the choices you make. Rey's family were nobodys and she became a hero despite it. Kylo's family were heroes and he chose to remain bad despite it.\n\nPalpatine's plan is really just another Return of the Jedi. I've made thousands of Star Destroyers, and they're all Death Stars. He even fires one on a planet to destroy it. At this stage, the plot has been done to death, that seeing another planet destroyed invoked no emotions.\n\nThe first act involves the crew looking for an item that would lead them to where Palpatine is hiding. Its filled with what the film maker's want to convince us is witty banter, but its actually Oscar Issac's frustration leaking into his character because I get the vibes that he genuinely does not want to be here. Its actually quite amusing, albeit unintentional. Through a series of plot contrivances, fake-out deaths and Rey magically learning the two most powerful Dark Side techniques (Force Lightning and Force Healing) without any training or knowledge of how to do it, they get the McGuffin and go to Endor to the Death Star wreckage to find a wayfinder to take them to Palpatine's hideout.\n\nThe second act sees the crew meeting up another group of people who deserted The First Order, and that's the full extent of their character development. Rey goes to the wayfinder and 1v1s Kylo Ren. Now this is the only positive of the entire movie. We have Kylo Ren, with no injuries and having not killed or fought anyone just moments prior, versus Rey, who at this stage has full Jedi training and an arsenal of Force powers at her disposal, and Kylo wins the fight. Of course, he's stopped by Leia using the Force to call him but leaving a message at the tone, that Kylo is momentarily stunned and Rey gets the upper hand and stabs him. She uses her Force healing on him before going to face Palpatine.\n\nThe third act is the fight against The Final Order where the army of thousands of Star Destroyers are defeated by the rebellion like a bunch of punks. Kylo Ren sees Han Solo in a vision and gets the motivation to go help Rey. Rey is facing off against Palpatine who just floats around saying to kill him so he may inhabit her body. Kylo shows up to help and Palpatine sucks the life from from both of them and yeets Kylo Ren into an abyss. Rey gets the determination to fight Palpatine and is supported by the voices of Jedi long past. Palpatine uses Force Lightning on her and she deflects it with not one but TWO lightsabers and it bounces back on Palpatine and kills him. Rey quite literally pressed X to win in 5 seconds. She then dies, and Kylo comes out of the abyss to heal her, giving his life in the process. The movie spend so much time redeeming Kylo and not only did he not contribute to the final fight but he dies for no reason. Rey then goes to Tatooine to live and takes up the name \"Rey Skywalker\". Where Han was alone so he got the name \"Solo\", Rey was supported by the Skywalkers so got the name \"Skywalker\". I didn't think the series would revisit one of its most ridiculous moments, but there they were.\n\nAnd that's about it. There's nothing worth remembering here. Where The Force Awakens had a variety of cool practical effects and some memorable lines, The Last Jedi had cool scenes and a genuine message, The Rise of Skywalker had nothing. The final fight between the two fleets isn't memorable because it takes place on a foggy planet with no defining features. Where The Force Awakens' lightsaber fights felt raw because of the excellent audio work, this movie's one lightsaber fight felt dull because of the lack of resonant sound effects and the random decision to cut in the middle of it to something else. Where Palpatine is a joy to watch in the Prequels and his cartoonishly evil persona is interesting in Return of the Jedi, here hes boring and does nothing but spout expositions and explains his evil plan in detail. Where Finn had an interesting character arc in The Force Awakens and was wasted in The Last Jedi, he's further wasted here, contributing nothing to the movie and the movie even forgets that he wanted to tell Rey something. And where Rey's powers were unexplained in the last two movies and her skills were unbelievable, here its at its all-time worst. She knows the two most powerful Dark Side techniques having had no training in that Side whatsoever, which characters had to work for and others sacrificed their entire identity just for the potential for that power. Anakin turned to the Dark Side just for looking at the power to bring back people and here Rey learns it out of nowhere. Force Lightning was only ever used by Palpatine, but here Rey uses it as a random burst of power. They faked us out with the deaths of both Chewbacca and C-3PO only to bring both characters back with the power of plot armor. They took the Force and removed any form of mysticism and wonder and turned it into superpowers with no defined limitations. They took one of the most beloved and well known franchises in history and turned it into a joke.\n\nStar Wars is dead, and The Rise of Skywalker was the final nail in the coffin.","displayName":"Dmitri M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1165862910/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:22:27.467Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:22:39.947Z","user":{"userId":"872292108","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dmitri M","accountLink":"/user/id/872292108"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Practically a mea culpa for the damage done in Episode 8.
