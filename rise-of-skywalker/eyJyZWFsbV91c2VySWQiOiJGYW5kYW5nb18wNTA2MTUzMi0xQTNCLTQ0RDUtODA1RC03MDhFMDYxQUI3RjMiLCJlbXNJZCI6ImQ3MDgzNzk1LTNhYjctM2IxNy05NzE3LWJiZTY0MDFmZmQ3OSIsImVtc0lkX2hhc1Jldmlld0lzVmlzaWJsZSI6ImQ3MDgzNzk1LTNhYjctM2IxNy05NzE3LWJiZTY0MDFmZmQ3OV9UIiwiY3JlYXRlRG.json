The new little droid. Amazing action and CGI. Interesting new characters (I'm looking at you, Zori). \nThe meh: First 20 minutes are a senseless mess of everyone yelling at each other and jumping too quickly to conclusions. Too many new characters with too little screen time and no backstories. (I'm guessing they are priming the pump for additional creative side-projects and Disney plus.) Kylo Ren's arc was predictable. No surprises there. Rey is good at action, but the emotional base was forced. One of the climatic battle elements was just silly from a tactical POV.","displayName":"TFTDguru","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T14:49:39.421Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T14:49:39.421Z","user":{"userId":"3ca5e910-fb75-4675-8bbc-2b66f6f9cb59","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"TFTDguru","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I'm not one of those trolls or bots.
