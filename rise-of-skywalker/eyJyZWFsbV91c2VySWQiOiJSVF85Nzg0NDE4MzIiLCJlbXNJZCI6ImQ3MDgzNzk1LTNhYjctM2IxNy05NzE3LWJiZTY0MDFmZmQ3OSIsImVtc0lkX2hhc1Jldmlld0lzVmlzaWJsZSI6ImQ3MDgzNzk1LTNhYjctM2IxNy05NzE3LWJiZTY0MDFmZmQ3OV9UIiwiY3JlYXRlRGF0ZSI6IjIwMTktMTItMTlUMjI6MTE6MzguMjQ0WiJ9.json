It was overly rushed in spots and other parts left a lot to be desired. There were a lot of easter eggs sprinkled throughout for hard-core fans, but it felt pandering after a while. The three things I did enjoy about the movie was the canonization of the amber (yellow-orange) sentinel lightsaber, that Force ghost Luke was much better than crazy hermit Luke, and that the series is finally over so no more damage to the Skywalker family line can be done by Disney. The Star Wars universe is rather fully established, so give us original stories in those settings...maybe something organically will happen giving us a new, well-loved and widely accepted trilogy that this last trilogy was unfortunately not.","displayName":"Timothy F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1923392347690532/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:05:42.330Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:05:50.330Z","user":{"userId":"976967658","realm":"RT","displayName":"Timothy F","accountLink":"/user/id/976967658"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"As a stand alone film it may be ok...  But as part of the joined up wider Star Wars universe, it took a massive dump on all 8 of the prior movies.  They developed some force powers to use for this one movie.  As a result blew a large plot hole in all the prior movies!  Star Wars needs to learn from Marvel and develop joined up stories.
