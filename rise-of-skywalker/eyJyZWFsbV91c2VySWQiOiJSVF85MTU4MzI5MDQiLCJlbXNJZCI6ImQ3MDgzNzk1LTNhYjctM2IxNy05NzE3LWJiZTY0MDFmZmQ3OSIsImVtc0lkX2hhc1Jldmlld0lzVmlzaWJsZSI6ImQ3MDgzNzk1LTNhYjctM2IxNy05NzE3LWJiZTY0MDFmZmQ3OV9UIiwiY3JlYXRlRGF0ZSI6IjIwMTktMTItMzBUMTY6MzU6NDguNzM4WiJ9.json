There are some great twists, expected and unexpected cameos, and a wonderful end to Rei's character arc. Much like Venom, one should go the theater and see a film for themselves before trusting the critics. So do just that, have a nice night out, and enjoy some Star Wars this holiday season.","displayName":"Noah A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/996767987364920/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T16:34:58.715Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T16:35:29.424Z","user":{"userId":"978492415","realm":"RT","displayName":"Noah A","accountLink":"/user/id/978492415"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"It was action packed but I didnt understand the plot.","displayName":"Vera","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T16:33:49.862Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T16:33:49.862Z","user":{"userId":"532b27a7-4c02-4ef9-b59e-0d7e98b200c0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Vera","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Entertaining.
