From beginning to end the movie doesn't make much sense. Acting is really weak. The whole Emperor Palpatine thing makes zero sense and is really stupid.\n\nThe movie clunkily moves along from one scene to the next with no real reason for the events happening other than if they didn't there wouldn't be a movie.\n\nI had high hopes for the Disney franchise after Rogue one...oh well. Mandalorian pretty sweet though.","displayName":"Damian C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/128161191148183/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:42:40.561Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:06:13.452Z","user":{"userId":"976645396","realm":"RT","displayName":"Damian C","accountLink":"/user/id/976645396"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"In my opinion this movie was very good it was not a perfect movie but it was a very fun movie","displayName":"avishay a","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:40:39.381Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:48:41.921Z","user":{"userId":"978450903","realm":"RT","displayName":"avishay a","accountLink":"/user/id/978450903"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome movie.
