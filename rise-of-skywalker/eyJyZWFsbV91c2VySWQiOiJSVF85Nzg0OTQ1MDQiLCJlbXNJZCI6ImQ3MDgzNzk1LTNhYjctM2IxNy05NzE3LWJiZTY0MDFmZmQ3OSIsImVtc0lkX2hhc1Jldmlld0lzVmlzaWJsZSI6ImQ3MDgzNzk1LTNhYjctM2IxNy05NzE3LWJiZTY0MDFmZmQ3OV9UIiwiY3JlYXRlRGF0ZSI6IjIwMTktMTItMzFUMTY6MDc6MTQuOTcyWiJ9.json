I enjoyed seeing some old fan favorites and the references to past movies.  But some things were completely made up and went against character development to drive the plot to completion.  I thought Leias passing was handled as well as possible.  Overall, I suppose it was a satisfactory ending but so much was contrived to get there, I left feeling the movie was flat and disappointing to a long -time fan.","displayName":"Jan J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T16:05:21.869Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T16:05:21.869Z","user":{"userId":"691477f5-6eda-4b16-98ef-48f50c34b0c9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jan J","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"First rate special effects, mediocre movie.

It leaves openings for continuing other characters' story arcs, in whichever media they choose.  As a film itself, it does a great job of playing with your entire range of emotions, from happy to sad, anxious to excited, laughter and suspense.  I'd recommend seeing this to even those that swore off the series.  This film is the redemption arc.","displayName":"Robert M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T16:05:02.707Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T16:05:02.707Z","user":{"userId":"24f6cf4c-b492-4b69-9c87-70ee59827943","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Robert M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I waited 42 years for this movie and was not disappointed!!
