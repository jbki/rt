It's not the great, but it's probably the best we could have hoped for. \n\nThe complete lack of story advancement, and character development (or basically anything at all) in TLJ are, in my opinion, to be blamed when you look at this 2 hour and 21 minute film and think certain parts of it were rushed, lacking, or absent. Basically, JJ had to cram all of what should have been in ep 8 into this film in order to conclude the saga.\n\nIt's sad, it's a shame, but overall I think we got the best film we could have hoped for under the circumstances.","displayName":"Marcel D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/658232632/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:33:53.121Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:33:59.814Z","user":{"userId":"802851053","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marcel D","accountLink":"/user/id/802851053"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was the best Star Wars movie.","displayName":"Kelly","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:33:50.598Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:33:50.598Z","user":{"userId":"5e66f1b7-9570-4c90-a47a-e16bbb60459b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kelly","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved the movie!  I really don’t understand why all the criticism.  OK so it was not perfect, but the movie was great!  For me if a movie makes me laugh, cry and gets me excited then it is a good movie.  This movie was capable of waking up all emotions.  I was sad to see that Ben Solo died after he had managed to escape the dark side, but We have to understand that he was once a bad guy and during such times he was responsible for the deaths of many innocent people/aliens.  And we all know that bad guys never get a happy ending and they never get the girl.  Why is everyone asking what Fin wanted to tell Ray?  Isn’t it obvious?  He was in love with her.  I’m glad he didn’t get to tell her because it was very clear that Rey had a love connection with Ben Solo and it would have been awkward if Rey and Fin shared a romantic scene after Ray and Ben shared their first and final love kiss. It would have ruined the romantic scene with Ben and it would have taken away from his sacrifice to sacrifice his life to bring her back.  I was happy to see that he died as a Jedi as he desamorares when he died.  Sigh.... .. .  Such a good movie!  I’m just sad because I want more.","displayName":"GariGuz","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:33:45.267Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:47:54.550Z","user":{"userId":"C099711E-96CC-4EC7-97FA-943A1D320B14","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"GariGuz","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"}]}
