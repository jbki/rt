Some nice sense of finality, though I might be mistaken, at sone point we do hear all the voices of the notable Jedi from the previous movies in the Saga. Fun popcorn movie, simple though the writing does make it hard to take serious and invest emotionally at times, rather any emotion usually comes through dependence on nostalgia and knowing that this is supposed to be the end of the Skywalker saga.

Expecting to sit this one out, I listened to a ton of reviews including spoiler heavy analyses.  I broke down and saw it this morning and have to say that I really enjoyed it.  Went through 2 hankies!  Definitely the most emotional I've gotten watching the sequel trilogy and that's what makes this film stand out.  The criticisms are totally valid in terms of throwing everything in, breakneck pace, ret-cons, etc. but, my personal response was very positive.  [I actually think the spoiler heavy analyses I listened to beforehand helped me understand what was going on.]  I felt this was the first of the ST films that had the new characters front and center and they shone for me.  The chemistry that was so evident in the first act of TFA was on display here.  This conclusion really showed how negatively the left-turn made by Rian Johnson affected the trilogy.  Really wished this could have been broken into a Part I and Part II.  A truly pleasant surprise.","displayName":"Alexis C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:44:53.235Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:44:53.235Z","user":{"userId":"978453399","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alexis C","accountLink":"/user/id/978453399"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Tied together a lot of loose ends and closed some holes.
