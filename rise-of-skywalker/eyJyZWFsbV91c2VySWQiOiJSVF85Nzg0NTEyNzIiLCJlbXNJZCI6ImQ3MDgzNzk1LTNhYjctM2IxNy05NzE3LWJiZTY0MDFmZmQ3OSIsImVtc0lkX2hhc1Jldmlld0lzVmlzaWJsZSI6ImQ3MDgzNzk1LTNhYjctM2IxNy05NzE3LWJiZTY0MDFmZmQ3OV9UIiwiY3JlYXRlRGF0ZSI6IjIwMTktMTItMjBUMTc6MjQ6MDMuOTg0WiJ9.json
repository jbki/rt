I was so hoping to see something that brought the trilogy together.  But it was a mixed up no sense plot that hurts the other two movies!  There is no emotion in this movie.  I should have felt something but nothing.  Waste of great new and old characters!!  Only good thing about it is the score and special effects are really good in spots.  Other than that the plot is mind numbing.  Don't wast your money.  I'm so sad about this.","displayName":"will T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:19:34.394Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:20:45.423Z","user":{"userId":"960766514","realm":"RT","displayName":"will T","accountLink":"/user/id/960766514"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Darth sidious was the best part of the film.

The film is busy. It has a lot going on. Too many new characters, new planets in a fast-paced mind-screw of action and story plot, the film should be more adequately called the \"Rise of Palpatine\".\n\nWhere was Anakin Skywalker?\nOr Luke even?\nThe Knights of Who?\n \nJust poor pacing in a rushed job to get done and at the same time try to \nfix the mess of Ryan Johnson's crap story TLJ. It's hard JJ I get it.\n\nI'm 48 years old and this story arch has been apart of my life since I was 5 years old. Disney could and should have done a better job for fans. Don't get me wrong there are positives, like great light saber duels and space battles that are awesome effects shots, but the films pace and story plot are choppy at best.\n\nI left the theater feeling like my head had just been dragged through the spice-mines of Kessel and then crushed in a garbage compactor.  \n\nGreat concern I have with the future of the franchise from a Galaxy far far away . . . \n\n- Russell\nRockstar Magazine","displayName":"Russell D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10152370243918454/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:18:58.405Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:21:16.550Z","user":{"userId":"978451139","realm":"RT","displayName":"Russell D","accountLink":"/user/id/978451139"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
