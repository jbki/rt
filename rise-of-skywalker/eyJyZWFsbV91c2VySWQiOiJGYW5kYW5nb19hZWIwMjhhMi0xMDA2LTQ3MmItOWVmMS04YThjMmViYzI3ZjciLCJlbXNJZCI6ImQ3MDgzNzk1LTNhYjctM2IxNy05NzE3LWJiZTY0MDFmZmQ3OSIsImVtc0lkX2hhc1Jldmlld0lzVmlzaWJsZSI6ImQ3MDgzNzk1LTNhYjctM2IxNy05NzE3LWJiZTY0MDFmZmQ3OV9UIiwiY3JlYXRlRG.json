Critics are wrong about this one. Plot somewhat predictable but who cares? This is Star Warsâ€”no sex and very little mano y mano violence. Cinematography was very appealing.

I grew up on Star Wars and no this is not like the original trilogy, it is a new movie and new story line, but the way the that it tied in pieces from the other movies was fantastic.

This is one of my favorite movies and nothing can change my mind.","displayName":"Maddy L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/831963820589334/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T23:38:07.337Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T00:04:31.175Z","user":{"userId":"978485176","realm":"RT","displayName":"Maddy L","accountLink":"/user/id/978485176"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie.

I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either.  It was enjoyable enough but there were just too many plot holes and a lot of things in the movie weren't explained or just didn't make sense.  In the previous trilogies the Force gave certain characters special abilities but now, in this movie, the Force can do literally anything, including healing wounds and bringing people back from the dead.  Rey is more likable in this movie then the last two but they made her character too powerful, she's more god like then human.  In the end I felt like I was watching a superhero movie instead of Star Wars.","displayName":"Joanne T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T23:34:31.500Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T23:34:42.628Z","user":{"userId":"978484937","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joanne T","accountLink":"/user/id/978484937"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing!
