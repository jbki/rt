I got to see my childhood hero one last time, but the film rings so hollow, and I feel like I should have been enjoying it more than I was. I liked the interactions between Rey, Poe, and Finn, but the plot has too many stupid things happen. While some of those are impossible to work around without completely remaking Episode VIII, there are quite a few things that could have been entirely avoided if the characters acted more rationally and logically.","displayName":"Alex S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1015005595211239/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:39:48.609Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T01:19:51.211Z","user":{"userId":"970960697","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex S","accountLink":"/user/id/970960697"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Plot needed more backstory leading up to the movie.

But The Rise of Skywalker is a welcome course correction from Episode VIII. The humor is abundant, but it's more grounded and organic this time around, not slapstick or cheap. The characters are given greater depth than before, and more opportunities to interact. Loads of fan service, but it hits the right notes and rarely feels contrived. Episode IX is swinging for the fences, giving the audience what they want and nicely capping the Skywalker Saga. If you can forgive the breakneck speed and forgive its awkwardness in places, longtime Star Wars fans will remember what they loved about this series. Emotional and satisfying. I cried.","displayName":"Alex T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10109223286671380/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:39:08.291Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:39:16.066Z","user":{"userId":"978453445","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex T","accountLink":"/user/id/978453445"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"It was colorful and flashy but the pacing was terrible. I have so many canon issues with this film I can't even list them without ranting. George's vision for Star Wars was tossed out the airlock. Campbell's monomyth? Everything Star Wars is based on? It's like JJ Abrams said, \"What's that? Don't need it.\" Why is a Palpatine being hailed as a Skywalker? Why does no one, living or Force-dead, offer any support to the actual, redeemed, Skywalker? Why is my hero dead? Why is my heroine alone once again?  Nothing about this makes any sense. Oh, and that ending? I cried about it for nine hours. I couldn't sleep. I've lost interest in food. I'm wandering around like a lost soul.  I'm still going through the stages of grief. My love for Star Wars has been knocked down to just a, I like Star Wars. And that's really depressing.","displayName":"Danielle K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000032266586/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:39:06.877Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:39:14.086Z","user":{"userId":"907604599","realm":"RT","displayName":"Danielle K","accountLink":"/user/id/907604599"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I Love STAR WARS But The Story Of The Last 3 Movies Are Not Good At All, Of The 4 Offspring Of Luke And Leia Skywalker They Only Show One So Where Is The Other 3, So I'm Gonna Leave It At That","displayName":"Oscar","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:39:05.190Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:39:05.190Z","user":{"userId":"156C2040-EB5B-49CA-A566-DE480F46CAFD","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Oscar","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was so good!
