It was so much more like the original three movies...really thought they did a great job with it. Also thought that bringing back all the originals was the best!!

It had great action sequences, emotional moments, and delivered an entertaining star wars experience. I think it is a good wrap up for the sequel trilogy, although I would make a few changes involving some of the climactic scenes to make it a better close to the entire saga.","displayName":"Fox E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T20:24:48.173Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T20:24:48.173Z","user":{"userId":"f8eeed50-ddbc-4da1-95f0-a32b64605f1e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Fox E","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"8h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Would have been great to have more runtime to flesh out plot points but there is only so much you can do in 2-2.5 hours.","displayName":"JT S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1455670886/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T20:24:29.139Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T20:24:34.746Z","user":{"userId":"895506585","realm":"RT","displayName":"JT S","accountLink":"/user/id/895506585"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"8h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Hmmm it wasnt disappointing but at the same time it wasnt the big finale i thot it was gona be. For what it was I enjoyed it a lot. The throwbacks to early movies was a really nice touch. The final battle btw Rey and Ren should've been more epic as well as the showdown with the Emperor. But a nice ending to over 40 years the Skywalker saga.","displayName":"vincent t","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T20:22:49.315Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T20:22:53.043Z","user":{"userId":"921674685","realm":"RT","displayName":"vincent t","accountLink":"/user/id/921674685"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"8h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was amazing ! and if you're a Reylo fan the movie is going to make you very happy , huge props to those who worked on this movie too because they did the impossible!","displayName":"Abdiel","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T20:22:47.241Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T20:22:47.241Z","user":{"userId":"7a77740c-bf3b-485e-8675-0269d8360bd3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Abdiel","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"8h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Take out all the hype and expectations of being terrible.
