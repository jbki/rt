People who hate it are those who want something to complain about in life.  Answers many questions and leaves some room for the next movie.  No, Rose Tico doesn't need her own movie or to be the primary character of a SW movie.  No, Poe and Finn don't need to get together.  It's a great show as is... enjoy it as such.","displayName":"NewYork Joe","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T00:20:43.602Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T00:20:43.602Z","user":{"userId":"e2a7cc0f-6c54-4f65-9288-9d2dc3bd6a0a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"NewYork Joe","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great ending to the series.
