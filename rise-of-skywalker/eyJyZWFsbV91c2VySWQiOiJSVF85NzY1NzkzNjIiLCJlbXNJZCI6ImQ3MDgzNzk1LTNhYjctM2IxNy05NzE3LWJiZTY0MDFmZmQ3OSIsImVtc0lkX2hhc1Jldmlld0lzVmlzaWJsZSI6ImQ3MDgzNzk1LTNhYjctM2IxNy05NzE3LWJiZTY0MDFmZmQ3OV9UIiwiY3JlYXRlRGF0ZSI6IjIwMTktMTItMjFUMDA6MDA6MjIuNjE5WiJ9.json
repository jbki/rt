JJ manages to do something pretty good and sometimes speactacular out of a really bad situation.

Abrams did a good job with this. It certainly works better the second watch. It is perhaps the most fast paced Star Wars film ever, and every time you get settled it keeps going. What doesn't work for this film is how out of nowhere the plot comes in. I think that the sequel trilogy fails at having a throughline plot, but succceeds in having fun, entertainable moments.","displayName":"Jonathan K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/462093351350646/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:59:33.238Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:59:43.277Z","user":{"userId":"978454560","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonathan K","accountLink":"/user/id/978454560"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Very rushed.

I'm a big Star Wars fan (Empire Strikes Back is my favorite) and this was a good end to this new trilogy. \n\nWhat I think certain critics and reviewers are misunderstanding about this movie is the goal. They're expecting some deep, thought provoking movie. This movie is meant to be fast paced, visually striking, with tons of exciting moments. It does this very well. Are there flaws? Sure. Is it enjoyable to watch as long as you aren't trying to over analyze every detail? Definitely.","displayName":"Micah B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:58:58.444Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:59:07.936Z","user":{"userId":"365175451","realm":"RT","displayName":"Micah B","accountLink":"/user/id/365175451"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Disney kowtows to the worst elements of the fandom and renders an exceptionally dull concluding chapter.","displayName":"Michael K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100003044910915/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:58:36.602Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:58:43.843Z","user":{"userId":"916251441","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael K","accountLink":"/user/id/916251441"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing movie.
