This 9th movie manages to be an epic conclusion that was both eventful, and produced an epic trilogy. The movie suffers because of its fast pace, and lack of emotional impact(because of the fast pace). Many of the jaw-dropping moments which are amazing, don't feel as impactful as they should have. Which was disappointing. Ultimately this is a good final episode of the Skywalker Saga packed with action, nostalgia, and finally some answers to questions we've been eating for since the release of Episode 7. It doesn't deserve the hate it gets, but still isn't perfect. The story is decent and the acting is alright. But action, callbacks, plot-twists, and epic moments make up for it. J.J Abrams really did the best he can with what he was given, and listened to the fans.","displayName":"Jonah H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:12:28.213Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:14:33.338Z","user":{"userId":"978466081","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonah H","accountLink":"/user/id/978466081"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"}]}
