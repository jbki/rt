We felt it brouhlght the end to the trilogy together nicely. There are a few questions left unanswered, and at times it felt like the director was using a checklist of past places / names to put into the film.

It’s fast paced with no established plot until about the end of the second act. Most character arcs are pointless and the movie is riddled with arbitrary plot devices to make an excuse for nostalgic references. The story feels unoriginal and pulls too many elements from the original trilogy, and at times seems like it tries to undo a lot of the previous movie’s ideas. I’m not the biggest SW fan, but this new trilogy was a let down and this final act really showed how unnecessary it was to continue this story.
