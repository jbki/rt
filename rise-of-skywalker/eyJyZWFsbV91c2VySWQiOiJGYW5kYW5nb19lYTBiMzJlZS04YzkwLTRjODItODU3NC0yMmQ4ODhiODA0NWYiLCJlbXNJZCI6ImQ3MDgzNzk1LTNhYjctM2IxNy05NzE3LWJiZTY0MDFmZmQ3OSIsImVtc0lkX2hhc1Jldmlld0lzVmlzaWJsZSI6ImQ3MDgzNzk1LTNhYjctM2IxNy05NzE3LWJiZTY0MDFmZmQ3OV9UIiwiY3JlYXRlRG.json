Still, The Rise of Skywalker lacks in context. The script doesn't bother telling you the whys of things, or where characters came from, they just assume you'll believe things were always that way. With a great deal of the movie being pure exposition, to make sure people get what's happening, this movie only shows how bad it is for a franchise, or any story told in a series of movies or episodes, when the people behind it don't have the beginning, middle and end of it planned out beforehand. The movie pushes cameos and retcons in the audience's face, in order to please blood-thirst fans, but forgets that what's really vital for a saga to stand by itself is a coherent story, which this trilogy basically doesn't have.","displayName":"Pedro N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2599578040310044/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T18:32:31.826Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T18:32:39.763Z","user":{"userId":"978465912","realm":"RT","displayName":"Pedro N","accountLink":"/user/id/978465912"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good but was kinda rushed","displayName":"Daryl","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T18:31:59.848Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T18:31:59.848Z","user":{"userId":"38012222-A219-4239-9398-C2B9D66E7AAF","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Daryl","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"}]}
