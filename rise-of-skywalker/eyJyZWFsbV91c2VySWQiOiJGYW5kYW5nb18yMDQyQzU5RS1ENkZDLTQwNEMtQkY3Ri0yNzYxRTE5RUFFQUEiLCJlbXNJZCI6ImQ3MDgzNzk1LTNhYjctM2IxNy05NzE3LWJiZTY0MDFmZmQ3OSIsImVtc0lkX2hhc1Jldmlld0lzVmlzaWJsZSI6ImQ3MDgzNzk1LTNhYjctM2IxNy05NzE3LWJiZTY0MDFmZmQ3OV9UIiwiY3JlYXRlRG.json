Yes, the story has been told before, but aren't we all just watching the same hero's journey with most movies?

Not a perfect movie, but a perfect Star Wars movie. Yes there is fan service, but who are these movies made for of not the fans?

So I have been waiting for 42 years for the final film in the original storyline. This movie was FANTASTIC!  Well worth the 42 year wait.  I've never cried so much during a Star Wars movie as I did with Rise of Skywalker. I even have male friends who admitted they cried as well. The twists and turns are amazing. Definitely will go see it again.","displayName":"KJ","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T17:26:21.668Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T17:26:21.668Z","user":{"userId":"39f80eb6-9f8b-4313-84cc-667bcec589d1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"KJ","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"}]}
