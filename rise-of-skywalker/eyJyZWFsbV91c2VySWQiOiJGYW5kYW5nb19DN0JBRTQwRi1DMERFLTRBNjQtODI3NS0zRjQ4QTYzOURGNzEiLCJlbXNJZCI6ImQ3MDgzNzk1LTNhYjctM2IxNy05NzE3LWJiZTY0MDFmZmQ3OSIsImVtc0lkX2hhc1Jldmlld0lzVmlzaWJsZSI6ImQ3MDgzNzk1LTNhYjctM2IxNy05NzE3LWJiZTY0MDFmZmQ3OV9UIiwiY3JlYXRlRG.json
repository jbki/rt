Granted it is not the best film in the series due to the fact that it tries too hard to bunch a 9 film saga into 1 movie. J.J. Abrams is a great director but tries his best to clean up the strange mess that was the Last Jedi. If I had to wait for an extra 2 years or so to see a J.J. Abrams saga I would've. All and all it is a star wars film and though it won't be deemed as a classic like others before it, Star wars and its stories will always be apart of cinematic history.","displayName":"javier V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T05:04:07.292Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T05:04:16.511Z","user":{"userId":"937370157","realm":"RT","displayName":"javier V","accountLink":"/user/id/937370157"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"awesome tied up all loose ends","displayName":"Albert","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T05:03:58.047Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T05:17:52.321Z","user":{"userId":"CAA09FE3-C59C-46E8-B794-B942284FE6F7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Albert","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"First id like to say how the 3d glasses and this film went terribly together. The glasses tipped the black levels to a point where the only point i could see movie enjoyably was not during something something darkside plot points shich was...almost all of it. The film itself however felt like a quick rip at killing off everyone in a rush. I would only ever watch this movie again to see it in something clearer than 3d.","displayName":"Thomas","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T05:03:18.303Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T05:03:18.303Z","user":{"userId":"221c031a-77c3-449a-a4cc-912058146eef","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Thomas","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"There were a few moments that were a little off, but as a whole, it was a great movie.","displayName":"Sean N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T05:03:13.916Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T05:03:13.916Z","user":{"userId":"2534d127-bd05-4baa-b622-0fd3cfec6dbb","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sean N","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Perfect ending.
