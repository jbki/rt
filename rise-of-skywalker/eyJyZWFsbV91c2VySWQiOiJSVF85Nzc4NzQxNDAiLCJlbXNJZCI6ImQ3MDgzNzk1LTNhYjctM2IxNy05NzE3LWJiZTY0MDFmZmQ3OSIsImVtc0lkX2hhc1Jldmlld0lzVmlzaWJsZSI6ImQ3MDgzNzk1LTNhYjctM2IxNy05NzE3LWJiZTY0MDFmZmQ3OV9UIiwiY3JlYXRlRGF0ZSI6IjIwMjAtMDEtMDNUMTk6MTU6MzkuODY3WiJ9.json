Several critics have killed this movie but I think it was a great homage to all of the original characters in the original Star Wars movie \"A New Hope\" (over 40 years ago). We went on New Year's Eve like we did two years ago for \"The Last Jedi\" and it has now become a tradition that we will try to continue for future movies.","displayName":"Alan H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T19:12:40.793Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T19:12:40.793Z","user":{"userId":"0c0f4ae0-bc0e-468e-a59d-592eca350182","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Alan H","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"10h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The final destruction of Star Wars.","displayName":"Jason C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T19:12:40.263Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T19:12:51.723Z","user":{"userId":"977018460","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jason C","accountLink":"/user/id/977018460"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"10h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The final vivid proof that this trilogy started without characters or a plan.

These books were written by some of the best literary people currently writing ( Timothy Zahan ) etc. These new stories in these movies followed zero of these story lines developed by George Lucas. I laughed out loud when the horse like creatures rode on to the Star Destroyer.  Then the Ewoks made an appearance (really) total terrible JJ Abrams and Disney should be ashamed.","displayName":"Thomas  T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T19:08:07.192Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T19:08:12.414Z","user":{"userId":"978501089","realm":"RT","displayName":"Thomas  T","accountLink":"/user/id/978501089"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"10h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was the best that it could be after having to follow The Last Jedi","displayName":"Harrison L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1775861155879256/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T19:07:51.444Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T19:07:57.806Z","user":{"userId":"978501092","realm":"RT","displayName":"Harrison L","accountLink":"/user/id/978501092"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"10h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Waited 36 years to see this end.
