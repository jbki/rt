It was a plausible ending of 40 years of a movie. There could have been many was the story tellers could have made it end, but ending made sense.

It should have stayed in the obscurity on whatever blog Disney found it, but as a huge practical joke to the fans they decided to release it instead of an actually good story. I think Disney wanted to see if fans actually cared about a well written story with good characters or if the fans would just buy and praise everything they did that had the label star wars. Obviously, they still made a boatload of money, so I think they got their answers. As such, don't expect the franchise to improve from here.","displayName":"Philip M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:39:01.557Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T20:28:11.906Z","user":{"userId":"973098782","realm":"RT","displayName":"Philip M","accountLink":"/user/id/973098782"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely wow  the magic of Disney is absolutely amazing.

If the last jedi wasn't a reality the film would have been much better and they could have expanded the story more. The only real problem I had with the movie as it was super fast paced and they didn't slow it down for the more sensitive moments. This fast paced speed made it feel like they were cramming to much in the 2 and a half hour time frame. It would have been much better for the last jedi to answer some of the questions that were forced to be revealed in TROS as it would have made more time space to slow down the movie.","displayName":"Luke W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/243288539972023/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:32:51.222Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:33:01.543Z","user":{"userId":"978492728","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luke W","accountLink":"/user/id/978492728"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Plays a lot like a disjointed greatest-hits album, with plot pacing way too fast for anyhting to have any weight. There's no time to develop any emotions, things are set up and immediately resolved, any time they take a risk to make the audience feel something, it's almost immediately undone. The film gives you the things you think you want, but in a way that makes the entire thing feel cheap, not well thought out, and just tired.","displayName":"Andrew M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:31:52.417Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:31:52.417Z","user":{"userId":"978492721","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew M","accountLink":"/user/id/978492721"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"}]}
