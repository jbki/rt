The premise of the story is utterly asinine, its \"reveal\" is contrived garbage, its breakneck pace is akin to a visual anxiety attack, they cart Billy Dee Williams into this movie out of sheer desperation even though the guy very clearly can barely walk or stand, Kylo gets absolutely yeeted which is tragic considering Adam Driver is the best thing about this entire trilogy, and JJ's counter-troll to Rian Johnson's TLJ is AT BEST juvenile and trite. There's so much to unpack here (and too much to work out in a review that doesn't span pages)... mostly because the honest, goodhearted idiot packed a bantha-sized dung ton into the film unnecessarily attempting essentially to make TWO movies in one. The worst of it, though, is that it ever needed to happen in the first place. Disney has been pathetically reactionary and insecure since acquiring the IP, intentionally distancing itself from the Prequel trilogy due to \"public opinion\" concocting the ultra safe soft reboot TFA, then reacting to criticism of that decision by letting Rian Johnson try to make a bizarrely nihilistic art film that created a divisive trolly dialogue between audiences.... just to then about-face again and allow JJ to reactionarily go out of his way to retcon the entirety of that 8th installment so much one can practically say Ep IX is both VIII and IX at once. All because Disney is so preoccupied with public opinion and how that impacts their bottom line, they can't just go out and make a stupid movie. Scratch that, they did. \n\nListen, this has nothing to do with Star Wars or fanaticism or anybody's trolly Snoke theory. If you like shiny objects and flashing lights while you stuff overpriced popcorn down your throat regardless of the quality of what's on the screen, go knock yourself out. Nobody gives two holocrons what you do with your limited brain cell count. But if you value your time, money and bristle at the thought of immature snake oil salesmen insulting your intelligence without even trying to mask it while there are PLENTY of fantastic filmmaking out there (like Knives Out for example! Honestly, are we even sure anymore that Rian Johnson is the one to blame for the mess that was TLJ??), do as a storm trooper famously did back in 1977 and just \"move along.\" May the Force be with you.","displayName":"Max Rebo","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:19:31.657Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:19:31.657Z","user":{"userId":"01df331b-61af-4b42-9490-6a40dd3694a4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Max Rebo","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"First two movies shame on them and the last one i will accept it's a shame on me for going and watching this thing.

The last three films have as been divisive as the prequels and like them, have harmed many critics. Will people's view change further down the years? Maybe. Rose, Poe and Finn deserved more screen time in my opinion but a touching end to the Skywalker Saga and a touching end to the late Carrie Fisher's role as our Princess Leia.","displayName":"Kate R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100006545441188/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:18:42.720Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:18:59.460Z","user":{"userId":"960879358","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kate R","accountLink":"/user/id/960879358"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was so much better than The Last Jedi and it was a satisfying ending to the series.

From rushed plot points to plot points that don't go anywhere, the story makes no sense. The cinematographers and visual editors are the only people who tried on this film. You're thrown into a setup that makes no sense and you knew nothing about (the voice heard across the universe), suddenly there are twice the number of people in the resistance with no explanation, the character arcs don't make any sense, and some people (like Kylo) end up having no purpose in the series at all by the end of the movie. \n\nEasily the worst film of this trilogy.","displayName":"Aaron G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:16:55.920Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:16:55.920Z","user":{"userId":"978480358","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aaron G","accountLink":"/user/id/978480358"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"}]}
