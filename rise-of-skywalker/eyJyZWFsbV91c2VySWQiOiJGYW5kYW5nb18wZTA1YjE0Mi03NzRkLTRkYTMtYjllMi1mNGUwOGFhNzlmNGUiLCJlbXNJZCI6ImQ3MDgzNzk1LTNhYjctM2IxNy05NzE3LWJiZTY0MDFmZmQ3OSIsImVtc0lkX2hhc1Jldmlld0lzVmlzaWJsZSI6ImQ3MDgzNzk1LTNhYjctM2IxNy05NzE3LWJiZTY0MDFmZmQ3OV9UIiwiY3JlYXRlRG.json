George Lucas should have never sold to the Mouse because it is clear that this project is too big for them.  There is so much Star Wars source material out there that should have been studied and ultimately used to make these movies amazing and satisfying for all.  Disney has taken something that was timeless and turned it into a tired, and uninspiring, toy making, and theme park attendance driving vampire.","displayName":"John R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T20:17:10.578Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T20:17:14.913Z","user":{"userId":"978501180","realm":"RT","displayName":"John R","accountLink":"/user/id/978501180"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"8h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I liked how this movie wrapped up everything from the previous 8 movies!
