It is for the fans.  It was exactly as I expected...typical Star Wars...good guys win with a little loss and hope is a big theme.  Not many surprises, but that is okay.

I won't go into details cuz it pertains to one of the protagonists However I feel this movie wrapped up several arcs for characters and that was satisfying. How their stories were wrapped up might be a common gripe for this movie. Overall worth the watch but temper expectations.","displayName":"Jason F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:23:15.242Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:23:15.242Z","user":{"userId":"e00099a3-a366-420a-a236-ecf69153234d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jason F","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"JJ Abrams was left the near-impossible task of cleaning up the mess of episode VIII & creating a worthy wrap up of the Skywalker saga.  He has achieved this lofty goal with a movie that ranks an 9.0 on it's own & a 9.7 considering what he was left with from VIII.  This is a genuine SW film complete with all our old heros & the new ones in roles worthy of their acting ability.  Luke, Han, Leia, Lando, etc. are there, & at the same time Finn isn't cast as a joke, Rey isn't a 'Mary Sue' & her powers are explained, Poe isn't cast as the incompetent male scolded by the female admiral with purple hair, and all the SJW garbage is gone.  Rey's character is stellar & she indeed is not a 'nobody'.  There is once again a \"real\" villain.  Luke says he was wrong for becoming a hermit & when a lightsaber is thrown he scolds, saying, \"A Jedi weapon should be treated with respect.\"  Yes, it undos much what we hated about VIII & frankly is a real (and justified) slap in the face to Ryan Johnson.  In a word JJ Abrams \"saved\" Star Wars.  IMO the entire 9 episode saga might best be viewed with 90% of episode VIII edited out.","displayName":"Ed G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:22:56.075Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:23:01.029Z","user":{"userId":"977295094","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ed G","accountLink":"/user/id/977295094"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"It's ok to fuck up your own creation, but to also ruin the last trilogy ending is in another level, i hope this last three movies were just a bad dream.","displayName":"Ren R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10215221970811300/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:22:52.202Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:23:01.010Z","user":{"userId":"978336215","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ren R","accountLink":"/user/id/978336215"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"UN ESPECTÁCULO SIN ALMA Y SUSTANCIA .
