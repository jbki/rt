Characters were brought back to life left-and-right in order to create emotional drama without having anything to do with the actual plot. The film felt incredibly messy like a school project that was thrown together by a hungover college student. It was an unfortunate end to the 40-year-saga. Do you want to watch a good film? I recommend you do not see this one.","displayName":"Max B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000087690886/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:55:39.897Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:55:45.092Z","user":{"userId":"891322575","realm":"RT","displayName":"Max B","accountLink":"/user/id/891322575"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I enjoyed the movie from start to finish.","displayName":"Jarius H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2528220764066504/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:55:39.783Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:56:02.663Z","user":{"userId":"978453138","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jarius H","accountLink":"/user/id/978453138"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
