There's plenty of comedy, action, drama, adventuring, and nostalgia (but not overbearing such). It's only problem comes from Abrams having to cramp the stories of two movies into one, after Johnson instead used Episode XIII to stretch two scenes into the length of a 2.5 hour movie.","displayName":"Oscar ","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000926108521/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:17:55.472Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:18:08.115Z","user":{"userId":"915571017","realm":"RT","displayName":"Oscar ","accountLink":"/user/id/915571017"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The critics are wrong, but it should have been 2 movies.","displayName":"Christopher R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:17:47.709Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:17:47.709Z","user":{"userId":"54CDE414-C16E-4D46-B1F3-5EE21CA3C107","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Christopher R","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Shallow and lazy plot. Only things it introduces are rehashes of old elements of the franchise bu redone to be bigger and flashier, relying on nostalgia and references to hook old time fans of the universe.

I liked the story aspect of that but the lack of footage to use left her lacking quality screen time. Other than that in my opinion J.J. did his best to bring back what Rian Johnson did to the franchise with The Last Jedi. This was the most satisfying film for fans in my opinion out of the last trilogy.
