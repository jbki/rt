Straightforward plot that repeats all the schticks from previous episodes and most of the characters. No more (and no less) character development than previously, and the dialogue is as stilted as always. So? It isn't Endgame and wasn't supposed to be. Just a windup of a 9 movie series of which at least 4 previous were worse than this. Get over it.","displayName":"John F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/607616168/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T00:41:50.183Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T00:42:02.185Z","user":{"userId":"905714504","realm":"RT","displayName":"John F","accountLink":"/user/id/905714504"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I'm not a Star Wars nerd/geek/dbag who has an opinion about what order to watch the 9+ movies.......it's a set of movies that after 40 years is still different than anything we have seen in our time.....just enjoy the hard work that everyone listed in the end credits of each movie has put into them....bravo!","displayName":"Boyd","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T00:41:31.113Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T00:41:31.113Z","user":{"userId":"808d39b7-63ec-4cbd-a527-113696bb0f8c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Boyd","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was a great ending to the saga.

The special effects couldn’t save the film as that lacked which shouldn’t have happened considering how much Lucas Films has the expenses. Even if the film wasn’t projected to do as well, still the film would have exceeded the expectation because of the name alone.

Some scenes/concepts were 'a little much', and yet somehow a lot of the film seemed bland.  Aside from Kylo Ren and maybe Rey, the characters seemed flat and all the emotion was forced and/or cliche.  A little less Disney and more grit would have gone a long way in making the final instalment more memorable.","displayName":"Randy A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/783795983/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T00:39:25.645Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T00:39:25.645Z","user":{"userId":"797134134","realm":"RT","displayName":"Randy A","accountLink":"/user/id/797134134"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"}]}
