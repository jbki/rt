Having watched all the movies, all the tv shows (rebels, and clone wars included), and read the new canonized books, I found that they masterfully wove in ideas across all the source material to deliver a fast-paced thrilling ending to an epic story.

I got emotional so many times in this movie, I don't know what is even wrong with me. There were some stupid parts, just like there always are with SW movies, but overall a huge success.

The amount of crap it talks on TLJ was bordering on annoying — but I didn't like that movie anyway.","displayName":"Matthew G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:03:01.026Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:03:01.026Z","user":{"userId":"976943807","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew G","accountLink":"/user/id/976943807"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"}]}
