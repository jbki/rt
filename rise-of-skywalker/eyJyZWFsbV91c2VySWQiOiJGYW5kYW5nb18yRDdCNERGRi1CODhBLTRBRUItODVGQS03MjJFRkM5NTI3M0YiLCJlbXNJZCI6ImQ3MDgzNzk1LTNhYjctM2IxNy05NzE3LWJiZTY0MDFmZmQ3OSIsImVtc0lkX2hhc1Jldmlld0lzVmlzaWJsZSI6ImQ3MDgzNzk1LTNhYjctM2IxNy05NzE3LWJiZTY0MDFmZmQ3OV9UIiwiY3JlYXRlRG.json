It feels almost like a metamorphosis, with changing characters and places but the same scenes.\n\nStar Destroyers, mass armies or devices, death star, planetary destroyers, some cult, even the same dark protagonist (which was not surprising for SW:TOR players).\n\nBut, it's STAR WARS again, some overwhelming feats, gargantuan stage sets, twists and twirks and wtf's, as we like it. All in all I liked it, the good win against all odds and miracles to end 2019.

Some major plot points make very little sense and don't hold up well to scrutiny and discussion after watching the movie. Endgame showed that it's possible to wrap up a 20 film franchise in a very satisfying way for the fans, so why couldn't they wrap up a 9 film franchise so well? It's not as bad as the prequels perhaps, but it's not very good.","displayName":"Ben B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T17:21:18.566Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T17:21:23.448Z","user":{"userId":"978099437","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ben B","accountLink":"/user/id/978099437"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Out of the three new star wars movies, this was best","displayName":"Jude","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T17:21:00.442Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T17:21:00.442Z","user":{"userId":"136E14F2-1813-4805-A80A-36DBB6BC1F83","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jude","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"}]}
