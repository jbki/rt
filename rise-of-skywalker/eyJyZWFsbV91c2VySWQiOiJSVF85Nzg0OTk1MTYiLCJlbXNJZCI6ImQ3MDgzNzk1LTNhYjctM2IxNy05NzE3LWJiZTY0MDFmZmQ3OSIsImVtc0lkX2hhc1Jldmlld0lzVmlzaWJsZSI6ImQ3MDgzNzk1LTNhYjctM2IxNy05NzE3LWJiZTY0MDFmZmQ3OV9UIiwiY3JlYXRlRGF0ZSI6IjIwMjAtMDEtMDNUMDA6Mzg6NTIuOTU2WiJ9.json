We are long time fans of Star Wars. Lots of holes and unanswered questions in this film. Dialogue and storyline dont stand up to other Star Wars films. Timelines dont match other films and shows. Character development needs work. New characters introduced seemed out of place. Even my nine year old said so. Also, the ending makes no sense, especially given the title of the film. Glad we went to an early matinee and didnt pay full price.","displayName":"LNH","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T00:34:49.971Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T00:34:49.971Z","user":{"userId":"f0b87f81-ef7f-4691-8061-65109e6562b8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"LNH","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"For what JJ Abrams had to work with, it seems like the best of what we could get.","displayName":"Michael R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T00:33:41.107Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T00:33:41.107Z","user":{"userId":"98AF24DF-E395-4560-A1E4-CB9A7241A1B9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael R","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I don't really know why but this movie caused a feeling in me i haven't had for a very very long time. Everything just felt so epic, I felt like beeing a kid again and seeing the first Star Wars film in cinema. It's so awesome! The Soundtrack is a masterpiece and when I'm hearing it I always want to see the movie again. This is by far the best Star Wars movie for me. It was so fast I didn't even have time to breathe and everything in it was so good.
