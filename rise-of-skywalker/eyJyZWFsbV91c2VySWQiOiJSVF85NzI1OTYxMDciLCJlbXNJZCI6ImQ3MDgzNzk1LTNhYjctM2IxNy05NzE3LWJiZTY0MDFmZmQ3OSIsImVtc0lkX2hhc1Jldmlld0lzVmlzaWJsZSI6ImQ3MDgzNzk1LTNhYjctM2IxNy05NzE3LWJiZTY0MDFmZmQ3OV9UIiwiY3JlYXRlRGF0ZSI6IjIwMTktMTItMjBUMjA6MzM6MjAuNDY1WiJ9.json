Growing up with Star Wars expanded my imagination and I feel like I grew up with this story. A couple of these later Star Wars movies didn't do a lot for me and characters like Jar Jar Binks were a little silly, but I do not understand the critics on this last installment of Star Wars and The Rise of Skywalker. This was a very entertaining movie and my son and I left the movie satisfied with the closure on this story. I think it is an impossible job to satisfy everyone but for the normal Star Wars person in their 50's I was happy and enjoyed the movie. I was entertained, it brought back several old scenes and references to prior films especially those first 3 released. I say 5 Stars. Glad we can all have opinions but why is mine always so different from the critics? If I go to the movies they recommend I am usually falling asleep or find the stories predictable or silly. So if you like the critics in general then ignore my review. However, if you often find the critics to be off base then I hope my review will encourage you go to this movie and just enjoy yourself and have some of those old Star Wars feelings one last time.","displayName":"Travis J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:32:54.382Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:32:59.461Z","user":{"userId":"974761340","realm":"RT","displayName":"Travis J","accountLink":"/user/id/974761340"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Everything happened too fast.

This is a mess. No payoff at all. To nothing. Pointless movie to the pointless trilogy. Stuff makes no sense. And the revelation? Boring. It could have been so much more. The resolution to the inner conflicts of the main force-user leads is nothing. Do yourself a favor and don't go, you won't miss anything.","displayName":"David N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2599669973486633/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:32:40.452Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:32:46.781Z","user":{"userId":"978389991","realm":"RT","displayName":"David N","accountLink":"/user/id/978389991"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Absolute blast of a film. Performances were great, music amazing, visuals were stunning. Story had great moments, but also a few hiccups and somewhat convenient plot points occasionally.\n\nOverall a satisfying ending to the Saga. While I understand the critics as the film is sloppy and rushed, that's mostly caused by the film prior that they loved so much.\n\nIt's not a perfect \"film\", but it's great Star Wars, and that's all I needed to end this Saga happy.","displayName":"Simon P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10114387194413984/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:32:17.788Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:32:23.905Z","user":{"userId":"978237670","realm":"RT","displayName":"Simon P","accountLink":"/user/id/978237670"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely amazing film!
