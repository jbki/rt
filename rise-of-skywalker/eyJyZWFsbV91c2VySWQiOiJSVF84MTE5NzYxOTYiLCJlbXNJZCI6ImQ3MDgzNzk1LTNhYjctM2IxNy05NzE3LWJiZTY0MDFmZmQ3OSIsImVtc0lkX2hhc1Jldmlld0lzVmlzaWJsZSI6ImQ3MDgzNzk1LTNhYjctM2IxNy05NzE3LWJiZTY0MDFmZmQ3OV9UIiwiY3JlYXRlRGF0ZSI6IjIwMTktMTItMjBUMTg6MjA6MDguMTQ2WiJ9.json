It spends half its time walking back the plot of last jedi and the other half on a wild chase for an object they dont end up even using. It feels rushed packing too much into too little time.  \nIts not all bad though... It has its moments.

Characters are not developed, or are sacrificed with little meaning or explanation. The whole story line seems rushed and jumpy. The finale keeps compounding and ends with little payoff. It felt as if the writers were trying to mirror the climax of Avengers Endgame without the audience investment in the characters. The story is missing the heart and soul of the original trilogy. Maybe the ending of this story line is a blessing.  Now writers and directors can concentrate on telling a good, original story instead of trying to catch the \"lightning in a bottle\" of the first trilogy. At least the Mandolorian is awesome.","displayName":"Mark F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100003124153654/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T18:06:06.022Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T18:21:13.933Z","user":{"userId":"971023895","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark F","accountLink":"/user/id/971023895"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Epicness!
