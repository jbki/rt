It accomplished what I thought it could not, which was wrap up the entire Skywalker Saga in a satisfying way and it made the Sequel Trilogy feel like it was needed. JJ Abrams came through in a big way with a film that feels made for lifelong Star Wars fans, yet will delight even casual fans.","displayName":"Harry T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T08:23:53.250Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T17:40:34.395Z","user":{"userId":"978457305","realm":"RT","displayName":"Harry T","accountLink":"/user/id/978457305"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Made no sense ... save your money and wait for it on a streaming service.  \nWhat a disappointment!\nHow can you get the Mandalorian so right and The FALL of Skywalker so wrong!\nIt was like the people who wrote and made this movie had never read or seen Star Wars before.\nThese movies will be quickly forgotten in the movie trash pile of history.","displayName":"Jesse J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T07:52:12.885Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T02:11:37.258Z","user":{"userId":"978441173","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jesse J","accountLink":"/user/id/978441173"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"My personal feelings for The Rise of Skywalker was feeling of sadness. Sad that this is the end of the original Star Wars and sad that it was ended in such poor fashion. The legacy of the original trilogy of Star Wars will forever be cemented in pop culture and science fiction history and to see it tarnished by sloppy screenplay and plot holes. Whether it being the relation of Rey to   Emperor Palpatine , not once in any film or Clone Wars tv series (which heavily involved Darth Sidious aka Emperor Palpatine) was there every any mention of Palpatine having a family and even without the mention of it in the existing 8 movies or the 6 seasons of Clone Wars , it's never mentioned why Rey's parents or the Emperor's \"son\" refuses to give over their daughter or why he doesn't have force powers himself. Nonetheless , Star Wars has always been about the battle of good vs evil but The Rise of Skywalker used fake killing off the main characters more times on screen then I remember ever seeing before in my life whether it them having Rey kill Kylo to just heal him back to live seconds later or Kylo coming back from the Emperor's force push over the edge. Altogether the movie was sloppily put together with clear pot holes that they just failed to even address. My final thought being Darth Vader being known as the \"Chosen One\" and the legacy is ruined because only the greatest Jedi ever was suppose to bring balance to the force to defeat the Emperor one of the most powerful sith of all time. Of course the sentiment of having the Emperor's granddaughter is too opportune a movement for Disney to make money albeit ruining one of the greatest villains , Jedi's and redemption stories in the process. The sentimental moments and the throwbacks to the original trilogy of Star Wars are the only reason this movie is worth seeing.","displayName":"Chris P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T07:37:28.972Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:47:27.678Z","user":{"userId":"978456877","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris P","accountLink":"/user/id/978456877"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This movie basically fixes what the last jedi did with starwars.

The movie delivers a lot of fan service and in the end of the day remains a fun adventure which will keep you excited. The course correction that had to be done does make the movie feel more rushed and there are several conveniences with the plot but as a Star Wars fan i would say I really enjoyed myself and I'm very satisfied with the movie we got.","displayName":"Alexandra D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2032012840436215/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T07:29:55.486Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:57:30.460Z","user":{"userId":"978005098","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alexandra D","accountLink":"/user/id/978005098"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Wow.
