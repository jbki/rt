This movie came across as a public apology to Star wars fans.  It was so good that it actually made me like the prior to movies more.  The first 10 minutes was a fast forwarded version of what the previous movie was supposed to be.  The remainder was filled with carful story crafted to undo the damage done by it's predecessor.  It felt and looked like a star wars film should. It made me actually care about the characters. Something that neither force awakens or last Jedi was able to do.  Abrams reigned in and clearly knew what he should and shouldn't do in a star wars movie.","displayName":"Brady K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/560805149/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:10:51.610Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:16:14.434Z","user":{"userId":"785515192","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brady K","accountLink":"/user/id/785515192"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"CRYING!!!!

Is it on par with the original trilogy? Absolutely not!! But hey, it’s hard to duplicate greatness!! Bottom line, my kids loved it and I got to share the experience with them.

Fan or not, the film does very little, structurally, to paint a story with any lasting sense of tangibility. It's hard to feel closer to any of the characters after watching Rise of Skywalker. Instead of developing lesser characters in the series, we are once again introduced to more. Where there were attempts at development, they were cut short and quickly rushed into the next series of explosions. There's no real sense of accomplishment with this film. Abrams may have succeeded in completing this film series, but he and Disney failed to create any sense of closure.","displayName":"Ricky R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157742983252644/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:09:19.692Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:09:30.209Z","user":{"userId":"978466075","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ricky R","accountLink":"/user/id/978466075"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Ending the Skywalker saga, hard to express how I feel about this messy movie.
