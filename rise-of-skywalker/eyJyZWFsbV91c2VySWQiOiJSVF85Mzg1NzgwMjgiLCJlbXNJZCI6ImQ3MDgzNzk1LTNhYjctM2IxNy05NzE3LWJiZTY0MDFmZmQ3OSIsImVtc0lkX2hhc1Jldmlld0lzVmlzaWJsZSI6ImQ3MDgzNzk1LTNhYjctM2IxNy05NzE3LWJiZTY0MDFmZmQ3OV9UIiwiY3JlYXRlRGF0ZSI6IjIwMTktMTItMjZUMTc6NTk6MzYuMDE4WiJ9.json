The speed of this movie, however, makes you feel like you are racing to pack it all into the last movie. If they were to break this up into two movies or cut some of the unnecessary subplots out I believe that it would be a hit on all levels.","displayName":"Nicholas R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:58:39.715Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:58:44.672Z","user":{"userId":"978417468","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nicholas R","accountLink":"/user/id/978417468"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!
