To bring back this character invalidates my favorite trilogy of all time. it is clear that there was no road map when Disney started all this. watching this sequel trilogy through just doesn't feel like a satisfactory arc. The visuals are stunning, and Kylo has a great arc that is consistent throughout this trilogy. I appreciate what Abrams did with him. Unlike most, I liked the last Jedi. I got on board with the idea of changing things up, but when Abrams took back over for rise of Skywalker, he undid that immediately. I enjoyed aspects of the film, but as a big star wars fan who grew up watching Luke Skywalker, I wish the Skywalker saga had a less messy send off. The prequels are worse movies, but even they had more consistency than the sequels","displayName":"Josh","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:29:15.683Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:29:15.683Z","user":{"userId":"BABA9FF9-0CD4-4031-BA7B-B7A032201494","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Josh","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Much better than The Last Jedi.
