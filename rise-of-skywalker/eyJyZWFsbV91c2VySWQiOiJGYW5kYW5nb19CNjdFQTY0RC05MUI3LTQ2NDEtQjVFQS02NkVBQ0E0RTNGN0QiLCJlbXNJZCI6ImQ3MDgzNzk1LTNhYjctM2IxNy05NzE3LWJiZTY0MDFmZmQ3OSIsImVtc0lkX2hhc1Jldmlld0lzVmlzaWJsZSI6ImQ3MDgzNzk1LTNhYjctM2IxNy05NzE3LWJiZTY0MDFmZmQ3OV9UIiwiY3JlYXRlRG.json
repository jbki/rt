And too much of it is derived from other movies from Return of the Jedi to The Goonies.  But the movie has some real emotional resonance for those who love Star Wars in general and those who have any affinity for this latest trilogy even after the disappointing Last Jedi.  J.J. Abrams has his faults, but he found a way to tie up all the loose ends to make good on all the promises he made with The Force Awakens, and even the promise of hope from the very first Star Wars some 40 years ago.","displayName":"Brian","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T21:17:37.711Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T21:17:37.711Z","user":{"userId":"ef8eccce-1bf7-45df-afaf-6d2e11b2c2bc","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Brian","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Felt like the same as return of the Jedi","displayName":"jennifer","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T21:16:58.437Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T21:16:58.437Z","user":{"userId":"1a4ef7ff-251e-4994-831b-605bdaacfd8f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"jennifer","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Donâ€™t listen to the critics.
