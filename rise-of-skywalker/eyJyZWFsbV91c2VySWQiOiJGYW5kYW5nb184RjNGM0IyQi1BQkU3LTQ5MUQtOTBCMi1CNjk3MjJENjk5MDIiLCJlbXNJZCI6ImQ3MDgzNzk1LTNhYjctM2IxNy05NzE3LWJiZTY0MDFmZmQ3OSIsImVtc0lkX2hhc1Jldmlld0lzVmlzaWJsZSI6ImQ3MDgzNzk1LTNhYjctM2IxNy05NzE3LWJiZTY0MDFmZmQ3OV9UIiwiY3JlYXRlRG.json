By far the most epic of any of the 9 movies, it impressively crafts the massive battles and scale in a way where you get to enjoy them - not just getting hit in the face with more stuff going on than you can possibly take in.  The conflict between good and evil reaches the ultimate climax with heavy dark and sinister tones - geez compare the kid friendly softness of Phantom Menace with this final episode and it's a bit hard to believe they are part of the same saga.  But Lucas's original theme of the spirit of freedom over the tyranny of malicious control and ultimate power rings true to the very end.  As a life long Star Wars fan (age 5 when A New Hope was released), I am completely satisfied with this conclusion.  Thrilled.  Relieved they didn't get it wrong.  They got it very, very right.  \n\nFor the haters, have it your way.  Your loss.  For the critics slamming this final chapter with a thumbs down - you have absolutely lost your way.  Maybe you need some time off or a different career.  Or hate Disney and want to stick it to them.  Yes, it's a bit ironic that a movie where the heroes are fighting against ultimate power and control was made by a company basically taking over and controlling everything.  But in the end, this movie, completing the most ground breaking, entertainment changing saga in cinematic history with such a fulfilling triumph is WHY WE GO TO THE MOVIES.\n\nBravo, bravo, bravo.  And thank you.","displayName":"Byron T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T20:03:08.265Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T20:03:08.265Z","user":{"userId":"978496599","realm":"RT","displayName":"Byron T","accountLink":"/user/id/978496599"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent.

This is a good movie worth the price of admission and popcorn. Sure, the Last Jedi sucked, but this isn't the Last Jedi. The story makes sense (well, close enough considering it doesnt take place in anythimg approaching reality)  and ties everything together. This is also the first movie where I genuinely liked Poe and Finn.\n\nHowever, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING LEAVING THE BEAUTIFUL KERI RUSSELL IN A MASK THE WHOLE TIME?!?!?
