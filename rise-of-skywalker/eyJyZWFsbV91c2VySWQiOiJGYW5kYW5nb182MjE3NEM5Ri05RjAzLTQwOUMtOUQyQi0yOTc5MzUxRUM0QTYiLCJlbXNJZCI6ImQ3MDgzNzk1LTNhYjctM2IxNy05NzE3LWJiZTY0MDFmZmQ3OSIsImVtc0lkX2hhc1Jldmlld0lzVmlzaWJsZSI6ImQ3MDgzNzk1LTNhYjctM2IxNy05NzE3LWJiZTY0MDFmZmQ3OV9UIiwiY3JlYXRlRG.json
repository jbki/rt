But me being a SW fan from 1977, I felt this movie to be hollow. I cared absolutely nothing about any of the characters. Except C3PO & R2. Disney obviously had no plan for the whole trilogy. And there was nothing at all of any significance in the story. It's cool if you liked it. I did not.","displayName":"Douglas T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/133814074744647/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T05:41:32.709Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T05:41:36.813Z","user":{"userId":"978493810","realm":"RT","displayName":"Douglas T","accountLink":"/user/id/978493810"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It provided what I consider a satisfying ending to what started a revolution in movies.
