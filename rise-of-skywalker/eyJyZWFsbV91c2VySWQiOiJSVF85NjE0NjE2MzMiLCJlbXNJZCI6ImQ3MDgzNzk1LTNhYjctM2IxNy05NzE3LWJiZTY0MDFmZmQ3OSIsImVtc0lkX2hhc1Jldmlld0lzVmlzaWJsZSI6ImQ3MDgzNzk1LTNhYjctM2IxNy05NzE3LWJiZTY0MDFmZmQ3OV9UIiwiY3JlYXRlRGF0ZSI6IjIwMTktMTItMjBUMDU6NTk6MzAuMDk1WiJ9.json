Aside from some rushed plot points and some iffy dialogue, the action was  great and was definitely a fitting ending to the trilogy and the saga as a whole. Is it a 10/10? No, but it is definitely a good, and at times a great, Star Wars film.","displayName":"Jake A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10152067966600892/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T05:59:19.277Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T18:31:20.372Z","user":{"userId":"978445376","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jake A","accountLink":"/user/id/978445376"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Non-spoiler review: Rise of Skywalker is what would happen if JJ did a truckload of cocaine while mainlining Red Bull, asked himself \"What if we did Star Wars and Indiana Jones and Harry Potter at the same time!?!\"\n\nIt's a lot, it's fast, and I'm definitely on board with it.
