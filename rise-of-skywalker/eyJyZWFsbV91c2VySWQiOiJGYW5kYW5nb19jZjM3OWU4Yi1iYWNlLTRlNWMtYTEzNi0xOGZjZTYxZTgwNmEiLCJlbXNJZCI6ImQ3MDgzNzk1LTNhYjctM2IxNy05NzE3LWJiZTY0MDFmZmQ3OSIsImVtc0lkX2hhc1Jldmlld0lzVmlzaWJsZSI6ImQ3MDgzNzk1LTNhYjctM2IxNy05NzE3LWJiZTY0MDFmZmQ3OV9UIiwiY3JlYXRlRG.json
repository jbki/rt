BAD WRITING!!! It needed convenient gimmicks to Progress the narrative. Full of Forced one-liners. With an unoriginal and meaningless plot. I am not sure which is worse The Last Jedi or Rise of Skywalker. The Star Wars universe has limitless potential but Disney and J.

The story shows a lot of surprises that I personally thought would had never happened.

Unfortunately, they didn't have a story.
