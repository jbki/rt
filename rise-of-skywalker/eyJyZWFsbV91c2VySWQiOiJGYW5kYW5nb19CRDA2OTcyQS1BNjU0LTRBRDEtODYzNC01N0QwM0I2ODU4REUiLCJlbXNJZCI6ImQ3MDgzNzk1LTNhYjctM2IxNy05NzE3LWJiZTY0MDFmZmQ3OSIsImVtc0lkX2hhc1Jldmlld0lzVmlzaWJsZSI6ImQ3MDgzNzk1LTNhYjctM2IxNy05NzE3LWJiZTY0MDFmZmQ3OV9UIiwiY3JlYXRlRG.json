This film infuriates me, but not because it's terrible, It's not great either, mind you. It's a movie trying to fix mistakes by the last movie, but being so very vanilla about it. It takes the problems of TFA and drives them home. It ends with only one question, \"Why did these sequel films need to exist\"? Answer: They don't.  \n\nWell maybe at some point Disney or someone can try to make some good Starwars Films in five to twenty years.","displayName":"Strider M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000106682201/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:14:41.853Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:31:19.038Z","user":{"userId":"897450919","realm":"RT","displayName":"Strider M","accountLink":"/user/id/897450919"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A great ending to the Saga. Could there have been more fanboy-focused resolutions? Sure.
