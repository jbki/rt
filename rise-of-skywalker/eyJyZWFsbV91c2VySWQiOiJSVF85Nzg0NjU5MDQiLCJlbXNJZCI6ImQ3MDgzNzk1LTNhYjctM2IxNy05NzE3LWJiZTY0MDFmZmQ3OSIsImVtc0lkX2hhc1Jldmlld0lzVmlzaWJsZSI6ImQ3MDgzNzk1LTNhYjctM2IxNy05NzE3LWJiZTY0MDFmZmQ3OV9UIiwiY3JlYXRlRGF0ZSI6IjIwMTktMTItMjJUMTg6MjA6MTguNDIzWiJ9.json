It permits the heroes to be heroic and follow their instincts instead of second guessing them constantly, as happened in the last movie. ROS focuses on the relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren, which is the only story that has remained compelling in this trilogy, and it brings that to a satisfying conclusion. I only wish it had been tighter, it runs a little long in a way that reminded me of LOTR Return Of The King's ending.","displayName":"Andrew W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T18:19:58.455Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T18:20:20.616Z","user":{"userId":"978460306","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew W","accountLink":"/user/id/978460306"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Really good action but not an strong finish.","displayName":"Yaniel L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T18:19:38.688Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T18:19:38.688Z","user":{"userId":"BFFDF7A8-D319-44F2-9104-5ED26AC33E30","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Yaniel L","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The absolute best possible story you could ever imagine... a truly perfect ending to one of the best sagas ever written.
