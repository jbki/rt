That being said, I did feel something at the very last scene of the film. I thought they nailed that pretty well despite many parts of the plot leading up to that point which I could have done without.\n\nJ.J. Abrams had an unenviably challenging task ahead of him with this movie. He had to course correct after \"The Last Jedi\" as well as wrap up this new trilogy and the entire Skywalker story arc! I think the movie did just about as well as it could have on both accounts. However, some parts of the plot and dialog came across as forced and quite cheesy at times. It's really too bad that some of the more interesting aspects of the movie hadn't been introduced in \"The Last Jedi\" and then further developed in this film.","displayName":"Joe K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10155978337677352/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T19:10:35.893Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:16:08.894Z","user":{"userId":"976960268","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joe K","accountLink":"/user/id/976960268"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good ending to series with ups and downs","displayName":"Robert","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:53:22.803Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:17:42.660Z","user":{"userId":"C59EB181-D018-439C-89AF-D8DCB2435205","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Robert","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"My teenage daughter and I are both longtime Star Wars fans. She fell asleep after the first hour, called it 'boring', and hated the ending. At least 40 minutes of it could have (and should have) been removed. There was too much time wasted with the characters running around after McGuffins instead of a focus on actual story telling and proper character development. Too many instances of deus ex machina and implausable coincidences. Stories must make sense and be consistent within the world they are set in. This one fails on both counts.  I won't be seeing it again and I see no point in wasting any money buying it on dvd.","displayName":"Leanne M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10152394646445692/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:52:20.617Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T18:35:47.950Z","user":{"userId":"977319790","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leanne M","accountLink":"/user/id/977319790"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I wish i could just delete all 3 films from existence a they are completely unnecessary.","displayName":"Zvejas z","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:49:54.843Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T19:40:12.442Z","user":{"userId":"978107688","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zvejas z","accountLink":"/user/id/978107688"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Top 3 in the Franchise. \nI'm sure there's some plot holes to be found.
