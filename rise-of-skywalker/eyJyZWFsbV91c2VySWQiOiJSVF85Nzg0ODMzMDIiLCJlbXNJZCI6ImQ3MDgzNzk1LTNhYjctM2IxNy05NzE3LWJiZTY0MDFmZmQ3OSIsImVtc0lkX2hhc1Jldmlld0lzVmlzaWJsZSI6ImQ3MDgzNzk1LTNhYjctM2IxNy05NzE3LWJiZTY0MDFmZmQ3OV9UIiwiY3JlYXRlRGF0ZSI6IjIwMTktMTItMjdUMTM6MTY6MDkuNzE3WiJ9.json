When the troops road out of a troop carrier on horses on to the wing of a flying battle cruiser that was the tipping point for me. I mean what was the purpose of that? Physics aside, there were no enemy troops on the outside of the cruiser for them to fight. And then there was the kiss at the end.

I think my only complaint is that you almost have to keep up with EVERYTHING star wars (cartoons, books, comic books, and movies) to fully understand everything that's going on and accept what the characters are doing. Gets to be a bit much. Maybe I'll go back and fill in the blanks.

My objection lies with her supporting actors, I thought they were totally drab, weak, and lacking in stage presence,  In the end, you really couldn't care less what happened to them, they never won you over, (that's a big no-no) the lackluster reunion at the end had me thinking: \"who cares?\"\nFor a movie of this magnitude, I'm quite surprised at the casting.
