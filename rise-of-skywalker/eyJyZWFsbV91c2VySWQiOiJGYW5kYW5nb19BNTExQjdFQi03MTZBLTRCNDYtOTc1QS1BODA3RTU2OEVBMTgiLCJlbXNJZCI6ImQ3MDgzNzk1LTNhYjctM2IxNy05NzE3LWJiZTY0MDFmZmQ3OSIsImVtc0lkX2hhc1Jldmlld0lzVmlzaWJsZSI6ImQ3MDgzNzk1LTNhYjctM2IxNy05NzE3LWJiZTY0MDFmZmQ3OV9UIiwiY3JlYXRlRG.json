I don't think Disney understands what Star Wars really is. What I have come to realise is that Disney believes that Star Wars is just a Sci-Fi adventure series based around these iconic characters... but it is not. Star Wars, from the Original Trilogy through the Prequel Trilogy, was a Space Opera Fantasy. Space Fantasy means that the story is based around the fantastical and unexplainable elements of Space, Sci-Fi means that the story is based a fictional science. Like the difference between Dark Fantasy and Supernatural, these are two separate genres with two separate emotional reactions. There's also the musical element that separates operatic media from all other theatrical media... opera incorporates the music into the actual story telling, where for most other media music is an accompaniment. In a normal film, the music is an extension that enhances the story. In an operatic film, the music is part of the story... and that's what the Disney Star Wars movies lost right after George Lucas lost control. The originals excelled in dialogue where the prequels did not. The prequels excelled in character arcs and storytelling better than the originals. The sequels are a shadow of both, a holo shell - not in quality... but in soul. I was wondering why the Disney films didn't feel the same as the George Lucas films, and now I know.","displayName":"James F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1991822874434523/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:27:06.810Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:27:09.444Z","user":{"userId":"976873468","realm":"RT","displayName":"James F","accountLink":"/user/id/976873468"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Must see if your a Star Wars fan ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:26:36.241Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:26:36.241Z","user":{"userId":"260306916","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260306916"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I LOVED this movie!!  All the \"wtf\" issues with the previous two are explained and tied up or built upon very nicely, resulting in a fantastic trilogy arc.  The cast itself seems to finally get to that chemistry spot enjoyed by the original cast in the premier trilogy.  Rey herself becomes a more likable character, in that they portray her as a vulnerable character who makes horrible mistakes and is truly in danger of being defeated.  I can't say enough about how I loved the reveal of the main antagonist.  No spoilers, but the Sith playing the ultimate baddie in the Star Wars Universe is one of the things that make Star Wars so good- whether it be the movies, the books, or the video games.  I highly recommend this movie, especially if you had misgivings in the Force Awakens and/or The Last Jedi.","displayName":"Shane N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2927073927337846/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:26:10.584Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:26:18.012Z","user":{"userId":"978471115","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shane N","accountLink":"/user/id/978471115"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it, wish this vision was clear for the whole trilogy.","displayName":"Justin Anthony C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:26:04.775Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T18:39:41.997Z","user":{"userId":"6D2968D3-8268-4B99-B57F-B59FE56CF17C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Justin Anthony C","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Don't listen to the critics.","displayName":"Craig O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:26:03.905Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T13:39:09.417Z","user":{"userId":"978471144","realm":"RT","displayName":"Craig O","accountLink":"/user/id/978471144"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I have always loved Star Wars.
