It had a few good moments and some good acting at times but that's not enough to salvage this mess. If only there had been a cohesive vision for this trilogy. Instead it comes across like a mutant hybrid of a dozen or so writers' ideas.","displayName":"Charlotte R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10152932078086918/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T00:22:18.365Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T00:22:21.533Z","user":{"userId":"973841380","realm":"RT","displayName":"Charlotte R","accountLink":"/user/id/973841380"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Super Great!
