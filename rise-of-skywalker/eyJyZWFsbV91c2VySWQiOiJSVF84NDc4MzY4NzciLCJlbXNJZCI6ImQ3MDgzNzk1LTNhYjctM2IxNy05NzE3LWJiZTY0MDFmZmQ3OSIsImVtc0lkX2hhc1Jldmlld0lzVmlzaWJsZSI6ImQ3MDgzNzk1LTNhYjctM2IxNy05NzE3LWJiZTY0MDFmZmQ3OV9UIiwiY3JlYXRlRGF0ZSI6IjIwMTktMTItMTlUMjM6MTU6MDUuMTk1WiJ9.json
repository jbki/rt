Was very different compared to TFA and TLJ. I wouldn't say it made risks unlike TLJ it played it a bit more safe. A few things JJ changed due to rian' s work but works pretty well for the story. C3-PO had more involvement unlike the last 2 and the film gets brought to a very satisfying end to the saga. I enjoy TLJ but this was better!
