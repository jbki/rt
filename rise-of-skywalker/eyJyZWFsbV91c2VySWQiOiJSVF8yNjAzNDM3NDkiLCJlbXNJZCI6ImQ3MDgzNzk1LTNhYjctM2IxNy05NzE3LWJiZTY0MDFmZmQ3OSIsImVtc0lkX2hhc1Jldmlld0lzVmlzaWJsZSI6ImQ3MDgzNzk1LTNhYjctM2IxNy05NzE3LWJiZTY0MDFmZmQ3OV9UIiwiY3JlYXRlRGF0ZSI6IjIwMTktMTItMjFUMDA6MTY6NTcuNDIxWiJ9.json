That basically sums up The Rise of Skywalker, it's definitely an enjoyable fun and satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga. The movie comes with its fair share of issues mainly that it drags in the beginning but then just feels rushed halfway through. But at the same time it has so much of everything we love about Star Wars, we have cool fight scenes, character developing moments, twists and turns and paying homage to the original trilogy. My conclusion: If you liked The Force Awakens and didn't like the direction The Last Jedi went then you'll probably enjoy this one too.","displayName":"Nico S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T00:16:47.695Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T00:17:11.455Z","user":{"userId":"977513801","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nico S","accountLink":"/user/id/977513801"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a blast!

I don't.  I very much enjoyed the movie, and it reminded me of the moments when I was a child watching the original trilogy.  The pace is about the same, the scenes dance around, and we are being swept from world to world following our characters on their conquest.  The humor is excellent, the characters charm. It is true to the Star Wars franchise and satisfies the desire for a feel good story ending!","displayName":"Michael D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1368187287/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T00:16:12.249Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T00:16:24.264Z","user":{"userId":"838485447","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael D","accountLink":"/user/id/838485447"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I´ve seen the movie in 3D Laser IMAX and that is the best way to see this movie. I liked it but there were a lot of issues, most of these issues were in the 1st act. I can tell that there was a lot of apologising after The Last Jedi. To all of it, excellent music and great visuals.","displayName":"Dominik C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T00:16:08.344Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T00:16:24.161Z","user":{"userId":"977724639","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dominik C","accountLink":"/user/id/977724639"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Not well written and felt unsatisfying","displayName":"Carlos","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T00:16:07.919Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T00:16:07.919Z","user":{"userId":"fbf9d47a-ce9a-480d-93f3-1cf63235aa11","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Carlos","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"}]}
