It is impossible to please everyone. The people that were never going to like this movie will hate it regardless of anything.  Many people hate Rey (women can't be a strong action hero) and some hate the social message that was part of this new trilogy, they will never give this move a fair review.  I've watched all 9 movies in the theaters, played with the original figures and toys in the 1970s.  My children have seen all the movies.  My oldest (daughter) watched all the Clone Wars cartoons and played with all the toys growing up.  She loves Rey and Ahsoka Tano from Clone Wars.  They showed her that girls can be heroes too.  I was disappointed that the Force Awakens and Last Jedi let Luke end his part in this trilogy without the awesome lightsaber duels I always imagined him having when I was a kid growing up.  Rey pulls off some amazing force powered actions and lightsaber  action in this movie.  Hey guys, get over it she is a girl, still a good movie.","displayName":"Mike M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:55:00.339Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:55:08.665Z","user":{"userId":"977933005","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike M","accountLink":"/user/id/977933005"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"So I hated the Last Jedi, it really underwhelmed me and I had some reservations going into rise of Skywalker but I was pleasantly surprised, the movie was fun, funny and engaging, I was hooked on with what was going on, I teared up a few times.

What I got is not only that all the leaks from weeks leading up to this being true, but to over get 2 hours of pure chaos and no direction. Not only did they try tie everything in a neat little bow, but they did so in a way that not only retconned the original 3 movies but also the 2 before this one. You basically erased anything that was setup in TFA and TLJ for what? To introduce new characters and give no back story to how the emperor survives but was cloning snoke? SERIOUSLY Disney how could you even think this was a fitting end to this franchise? If you haven't seen this yet don't waste your money, wait till it comes out on disney +.... My soul is sad and angry that my childhood has been bastardized and ruined by greed and incompetence.","displayName":"Jose G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1418740014/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:54:39.343Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:54:50.323Z","user":{"userId":"846551390","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jose G","accountLink":"/user/id/846551390"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Ignore any negative reviews.
