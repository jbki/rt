I am simply stunned critics are divided on it. Masterful in my view.  The perfect amount of reverence for this story's rich past, blended with several surprises. Truly moving moments, and elements that actually make some of the awful prequels better in hindsight. The actors, new and old, especially the exceptional Daisy Ridley, the music, the imagery, all add up to a truly worthy end to this saga.","displayName":"Ryan F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:23:35.362Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T02:30:09.693Z","user":{"userId":"978461104","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan F","accountLink":"/user/id/978461104"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Perfect end to the Skywalker Saga - can't wait to see it again.","displayName":"Bryan H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/701800642/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:23:20.650Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:23:25.546Z","user":{"userId":"783679590","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bryan H","accountLink":"/user/id/783679590"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Perfect ending to the Star Wars Skywalker saga!","displayName":"Aaron","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:23:15.105Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T19:54:07.821Z","user":{"userId":"2183ABFF-60A8-4877-9AF7-E4FD0D2C4964","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Aaron","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"It was alright.
