Possibly the best Star Wars movie ever, at least the second-best! I completely disagree with almost everything that the critics are saying. The only thing I agree with is that a lot happens in the first half of the movie. Although, It's not really that rushed. A lot happens, but it still didn't seem to me like they were trying to cram in a bunch of stuff in. Also, all that stuff... is AWESOME!! There are so many surprises and amazing moments throughout the entire movie! The movie is also hilarious! This is the best ending ever for the Skywalker saga. They honor the original and prequel trilogies, while also ending the sequels. Fans of any of the trilogies (especially all of them) will love this movie. If you walk into the theater wanting to hate this movie, you will (you would for any movie). But if you walk in, ready to be amazed, you will be. May the force be with you, always.","displayName":"Johnny V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T03:06:37.896Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:28:33.466Z","user":{"userId":"978443030","realm":"RT","displayName":"Johnny V","accountLink":"/user/id/978443030"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A great way to end the saga","displayName":"James M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T03:00:13.331Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:16:03.785Z","user":{"userId":"977515678","realm":"RT","displayName":"James M","accountLink":"/user/id/977515678"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"As a fan of Emperor Palpatine and the Skywalker saga this movie gave the newest trilogy a fitting end.","displayName":"Jeremy J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/670620609/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T02:57:34.286Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T21:25:16.800Z","user":{"userId":"793118587","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeremy J","accountLink":"/user/id/793118587"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The force is strong with this one!!!","displayName":"Jared","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T02:56:55.459Z","updateDate":"2020-01-04T00:28:06.275Z","user":{"userId":"5CBB9405-B9EB-4402-97FC-2C52C153C961","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jared","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"A messy end to the trilogy which is so full of retconning the previous outing and adding exposition of its own that its pace is far too hectic for anything to have impact. \n\nThe edit is all over the place, the dialogue clunky, even for Star Wars. \n\nThe actors give great performances, however, and the effects are top notch. \n\nJust don't think too much about the story.\n\nEdit after second viewing: I've given it a star more. After getting used to the hectic pace, there are still moments to be enjoyed even though they get little time to breathe. However, the main villain still makes little sense. \n\nDriver and Ridley are excellent. Some actors are unfortunately completely sidelined. \n\nThe effects generally look good apart from some CGI faces which could be straight out of a video game. \n\nUltimately, the movie is good but does not fulfill the potential that the previous installment or even Force Awakens set up for it.","displayName":"Robert M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1131316491/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T02:53:39.677Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:53:59.041Z","user":{"userId":"889173119","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert M","accountLink":"/user/id/889173119"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
