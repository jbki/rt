I watched Star Wars:  The Last Jedi previously and I liked that movie a bit more than this one.  I am thrilled that the trilogy was done so well and gave me all the feels just like being a kid again.  I love Daisy Ridley as Rey, bittersweet to see Carrie Fisher may she rest in peace.  I adore Oscar Isaak in this movie!!  John Boyega also terrific and a stand out I didn't know so well Kelly Marie Tran!!  The whole cast was wonderful.  Go see this movie, have some fun.","displayName":"Fiona N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:39:58.124Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:39:58.124Z","user":{"userId":"eb163632-d478-4a34-9761-24d996408961","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Fiona N","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"A terribly written mess.

It seemed to undo all that came before it, creating a patchwork of scenes meant to affirm certain fan theories that had no real place in the story. In the previous films, there was so much emphasis on Rey being a character who would become a great hero, despite her humble beginings, and that was completely ignored. In addition, there was no real character growth for certain key characters, who were simply relegated to support roles. Moreover, the pacing was awkward and it did not allow the audience to experience the more touching scenes of the film. This triology had so much potential, yet the creative team for this film did not take the necessary risks to make something both new and memorable. The audience was made to believe that this story would end with balance, yet it ended in such a way that the entire Skywalker family was killed by the one who orchestrated it's fall from the very beginning. This film fails to live up to its title.","displayName":"Kristen C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1415224304/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:39:36.821Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:40:12.846Z","user":{"userId":"867739500","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kristen C","accountLink":"/user/id/867739500"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"}]}
