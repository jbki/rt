Bringing back Palpatine completely destroyed any credibility and effort put forth by the original trilogy. Hell, the original saga. This was a series that should have never been touched. If another set of Star Wars movies just HAD to be made, a series of 'A Star Wars Story' movies would have been much preferred to these past three trainwrecks of movies. One good piece about this movie was Kylo Ren's character arc. Despite how similar I found it to be to Vader's end, it was interesting to see another aspiring sith to come around. J.J., appreciate the effort, I imagine it was never meant to be easy. 1/5.","displayName":"Matt M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2252303221733391/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-25T20:30:36.556Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T20:30:45.702Z","user":{"userId":"978477675","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt M","accountLink":"/user/id/978477675"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Too many plot holes and poor choice by characters,","displayName":"Chris A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T20:29:43.138Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T20:29:43.138Z","user":{"userId":"FAE609BF-B275-45AA-9883-8E87BF59E327","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chris A","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"}]}
