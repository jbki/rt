It was a little difficult because of the whole Rian Johnson vs JJ Abrams rift in the force. Things didn't line up perfectly. JJ set us up perfectly with TFA, Rian came in and basically undid every plot point that JJ had set up during TLJ, and then JJ had to come back in and salvage his original plan with TROS. It definitely causes some problems, but I think he did a great job with what he was handed. Definitely a couple plot holes, but I find myself able to look past them where my husband cannot. He felt certain things were forced and should have been left alone. He felt a few things were made up for the sake of the plot that haven't been a part of the universe all along. He's not wrong, but personally I think they did a fair job explaining those things into being. Overall, I think they did a good job wrapping up the trilogy and cleaning up Rian's mess. It felt right to me.","displayName":"ML","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T05:30:37.199Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T05:30:37.199Z","user":{"userId":"eced26e1-e0f8-4090-9e8f-f93d5fa46205","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"ML","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"23h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I saw the first one when I was nine and this one reminds me of a dinner with an old friend from grade school who you rarely see.
