However, the film ultimately gives a satisfying and worthwhile conclusion.  It all makes you wonder what could have been with three J.J.

There were definitely some good parts, but honestly, several parts felt very long and the character development was choppy and rushed.  The basic story was interesting, but I think it would have been better if it was dividing into two movies.  There was simply too much to cram into a single film.","displayName":"Timothy E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/227360511052531/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:47:53.505Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:47:59.707Z","user":{"userId":"975925995","realm":"RT","displayName":"Timothy E","accountLink":"/user/id/975925995"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Predictable, but still fun.","displayName":"Sherman C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:47:51.881Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:47:51.881Z","user":{"userId":"10f08f1b-b5c2-4a5c-8988-e2349904d696","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sherman C","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The movie is extremely bad, trying to save what can be saved in this messy trilogy. The plot is artificial, pointless. It is a bad movie as such also because the pace is too fast, thus we don't have the time to feel emotions and develop feelings for the characters. Disney should understand that they had a treasury, a universe that meant so much for so many of us, and they destroyed the entire star wars universe, killed the fandom's hype. I don't need to write more on this movie. I am done. Only the George Lucas's ones are canon, and these are the only one I will rewatch.","displayName":"j t","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:47:26.774Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:47:31.241Z","user":{"userId":"977148903","realm":"RT","displayName":"j t","accountLink":"/user/id/977148903"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"It`s not SW.\nIt was fail","displayName":" ","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/156130332313251/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:46:30.558Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:46:54.537Z","user":{"userId":"978453393","realm":"RT","displayName":" ","accountLink":"/user/id/978453393"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great ending to the saga.
