However this is episode 9 of one of the greatest fantasy stories ever created in cinema. And as the last episode of this saga, in terms of story continuity and character development it is very disappointing and should receive 0.5 star. I gave it 2 stars as something in between both views. Some choices simply don't make sense considering the past films in the series. I believe this last trilogy should be separated from the other movies in the series. The Skywalker story ends with episode 6, The Return of the Jedi. This \"Disney\" trilogy is in general a very confusing series where characters are introduced, just to be ignored or removed in the nest movie not to mention certain \"artistic liberties\" done by both directors of this trilogy.\nLet's hope the future of Star Wars is a better one with new and better stories and characters.","displayName":"Sergio B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T13:55:41.807Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T13:55:51.254Z","user":{"userId":"977521733","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sergio B","accountLink":"/user/id/977521733"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"15h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Clearly critics aren't fans.
