Certain scenes felt slightly repetitive of the previous two movies in the saga, which made the movie slightly less exciting at times. The action and special effects were really excellent, as well as scenes with characters from the past. It is an exciting turning point when Ben finally returns from being Kylo Ren and comes back to the good side of the fight. It is an excellent moment when he and Rey embrace each other and finally kiss. The romantic in me felt really disappointed when Ben died, but I guess it prevents the movie from being a predictable clich√©. Worth the watch if you're a fan!","displayName":"Marissa P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157931121502264/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T15:50:44.536Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T15:51:08.027Z","user":{"userId":"978487087","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marissa P","accountLink":"/user/id/978487087"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"It was a little off putting.
