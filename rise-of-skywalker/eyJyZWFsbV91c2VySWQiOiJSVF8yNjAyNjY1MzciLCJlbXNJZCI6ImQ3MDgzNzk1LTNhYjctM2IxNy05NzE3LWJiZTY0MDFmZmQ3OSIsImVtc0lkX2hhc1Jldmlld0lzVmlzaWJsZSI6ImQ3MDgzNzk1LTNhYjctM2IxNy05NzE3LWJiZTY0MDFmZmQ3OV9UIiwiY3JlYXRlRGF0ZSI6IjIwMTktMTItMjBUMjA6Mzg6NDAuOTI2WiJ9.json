Rey finally struggled with something and generally acted closer to what we expect from a human being. Kylo was more of a respectable villain and less of a kid throwing a tantrum. Poe and Finn actually did something useful and advanced the plot. The good guys actually had a chance to interact with each other, but not a lot, as the movie really rushed to get all of its convoluted plot points checked off the list and all the mcguffins placed in right hands. Everything to do with Palpatine's comeback is dumb - his return, his plan, his (hopefully final) demise. I hated the whole ending. He shouldn't even be in this movie.","displayName":"Czeslaw N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:38:34.051Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:30:42.162Z","user":{"userId":"977710159","realm":"RT","displayName":"Czeslaw N","accountLink":"/user/id/977710159"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I loved the ending , actually is perfect , but there was so many things that can be explained better","displayName":"Roberto V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:38:28.126Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:38:28.126Z","user":{"userId":"5825ADF9-A7A1-4E0B-8EEE-4CAE4BD8225F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Roberto V","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Damn near pitch perfect ending to the saga.

If you're a huge fan like me, you will love all the details and Easter eggs relating to previous movies. I was only upset about some minor decisions made in the movie. Would have made a couple small changes to the ending, if it were my decision. All in all a beautiful movie, and a great ending for the story of Skywalker.","displayName":"Jonathon G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/743276909516874/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:37:55.643Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:38:02.732Z","user":{"userId":"978452999","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonathon G","accountLink":"/user/id/978452999"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good conclusion to a fantastic saga","displayName":"Michael","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:37:23.638Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:37:23.638Z","user":{"userId":"5D986693-12F7-4870-8FC6-BEDB62F7A2F6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely fantastic way to end the saga, my favorite of the new trilogy and my 4th favorite of the entire saga.
