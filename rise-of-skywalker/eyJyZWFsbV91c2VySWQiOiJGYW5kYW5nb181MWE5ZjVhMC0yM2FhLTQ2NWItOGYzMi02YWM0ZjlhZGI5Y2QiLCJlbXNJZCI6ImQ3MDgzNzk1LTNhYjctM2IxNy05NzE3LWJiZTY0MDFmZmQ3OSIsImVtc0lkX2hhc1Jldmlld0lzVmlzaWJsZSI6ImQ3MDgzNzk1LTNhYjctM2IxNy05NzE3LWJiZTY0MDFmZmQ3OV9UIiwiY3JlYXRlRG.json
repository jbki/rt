It will be completely cleared from my memory bank. As a life long Star Wars fan that movie was abomination.  Lazy, Lazy writing and just stupid script. The whole concept of the Emperor coming back and this Palpatine garbage marginalizing the Skywalkers was a joke.  Abrams is absolute hack.  I am done with Disney's version of Star Wars. Embarrassment of a movie.","displayName":"Andrew  M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T17:58:54.157Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T17:58:54.157Z","user":{"userId":"de1d4225-0b2c-4ff2-8ab0-ab7751cc562b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Andrew  M","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I liked the plot line but some of the action was very predictable.

The movie both suffered and benefited from the Disney and J J Abrams influences but overall you would be hard pressed to do a better job of bringing the saga to a close and taking it full circle to not just it origins, but the emotional feel of its origins. And just for good measure, it left room for the story to continue.","displayName":"David","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T17:58:26.040Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T17:58:26.040Z","user":{"userId":"68B2A9D1-AAE9-43BB-8834-F3FD63412C3F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"David","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"it sucked, it didn't feel like watching a star wars movie and the storyline was just awful","displayName":"David","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T17:58:17.454Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T17:58:17.454Z","user":{"userId":"AD29F773-B589-4338-8591-78DA7620FAC7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"David","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"it was emotional, ended a saga in the best way it could, may the force be with us so we can have another movie this year","displayName":"Phm V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2032208820208279/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T17:58:14.490Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T17:58:26.996Z","user":{"userId":"977802100","realm":"RT","displayName":"Phm V","accountLink":"/user/id/977802100"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"GREAT MOVIE.

There was also action from the beginning to the end.\nAll in all very well done and worth seeing.","displayName":"Michael","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T17:56:38.625Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T17:56:38.625Z","user":{"userId":"d0bcc509-1336-4da7-9e1a-6225568a7d8f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"written for a child by a child, such a shame","displayName":"Marcin P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/735762914/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T17:56:19.608Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T17:56:22.548Z","user":{"userId":"794350242","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marcin P","accountLink":"/user/id/794350242"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"}]}
