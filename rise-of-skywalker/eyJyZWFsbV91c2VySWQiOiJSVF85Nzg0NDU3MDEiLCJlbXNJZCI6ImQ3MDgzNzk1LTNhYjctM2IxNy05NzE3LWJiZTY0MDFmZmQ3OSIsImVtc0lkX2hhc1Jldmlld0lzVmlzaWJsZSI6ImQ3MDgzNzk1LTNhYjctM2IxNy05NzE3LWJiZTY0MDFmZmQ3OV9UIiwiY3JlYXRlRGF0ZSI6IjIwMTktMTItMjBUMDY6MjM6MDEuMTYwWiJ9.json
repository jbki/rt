I appreciate that. I like how they weren't afraid to go into mythos. The pacing was a bit rushed but this makes sense given that this movie had to follow a movie that tore the story apart and left Episode 9 with nothing to work with. The Force powers were a bit overboard. But I liked it. I liked that it felt right. I liked a lot of it.","displayName":"Bluered L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2196748800629324/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:18:32.577Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:23:35.923Z","user":{"userId":"978445645","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bluered L","accountLink":"/user/id/978445645"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Maybe I just love star wars but I liked it. There were certain problems with retcons but that's basically par for the course  for star wars movies if we're being honest.
