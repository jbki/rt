It was jumbled up. My kid after about a 3rd way through said, \"I'm not too sure what's going on.\" \n\nThis is because there like 10 stories going on, ... I get you have to bring it all to a closure, but I think that all loose ends are due to there not being a 3-movie roadmap.  So, you tied up 10 loose ends, but left 30 other loose ends behind.\n\nVisually and acting was really great! So, I will say that was great, but you need a story, ... period.","displayName":"Loren W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10221576953676536/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T16:35:49.717Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T16:36:00.084Z","user":{"userId":"978298624","realm":"RT","displayName":"Loren W","accountLink":"/user/id/978298624"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"}]}
