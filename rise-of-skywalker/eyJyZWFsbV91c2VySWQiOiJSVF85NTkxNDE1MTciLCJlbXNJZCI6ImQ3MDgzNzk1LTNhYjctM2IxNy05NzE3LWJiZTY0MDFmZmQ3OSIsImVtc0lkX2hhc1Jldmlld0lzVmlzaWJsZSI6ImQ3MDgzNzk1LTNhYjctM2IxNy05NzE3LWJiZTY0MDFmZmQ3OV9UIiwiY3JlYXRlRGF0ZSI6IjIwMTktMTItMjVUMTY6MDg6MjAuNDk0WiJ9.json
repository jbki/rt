I think he did a good job of trying to fill in the plot holes.  He may have played a bit too much homage to the original trilogy, but I can live with it.  Disney would be smart to give Abrams the ability to do the next trilogy.  If he can do three movies of the quality of Rogue One (arguably one of the best of all of the Star Wars films), Disney will redeem themselves.","displayName":"Dan M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T16:08:17.191Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T16:08:17.191Z","user":{"userId":"1da04016-393a-465c-82a8-ff9c8bd11254","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dan M","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Completely retcons the original trilogy.
