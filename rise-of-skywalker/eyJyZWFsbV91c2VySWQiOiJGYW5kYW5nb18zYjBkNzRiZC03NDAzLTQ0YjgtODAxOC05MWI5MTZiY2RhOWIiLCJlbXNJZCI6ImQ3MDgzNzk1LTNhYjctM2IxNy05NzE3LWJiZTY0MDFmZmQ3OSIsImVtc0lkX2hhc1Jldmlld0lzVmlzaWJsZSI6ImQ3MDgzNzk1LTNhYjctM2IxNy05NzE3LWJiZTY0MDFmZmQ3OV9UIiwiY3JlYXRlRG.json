I've been a dedicated fan since I was a kid, but they went into this new trilogy with no plan, and it really shows. Save yourself a few bucks and go see a better movie that tries something new. This one was full of plot holes.","displayName":"R R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T06:41:18.446Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T06:41:21.860Z","user":{"userId":"978479177","realm":"RT","displayName":"R R","accountLink":"/user/id/978479177"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The movie did as good a job as possible wrapping up the Skywalker saga.  It's not perfect but it's fun and has some great moments.  The action is top notch as you would expect.  My biggest gripe is the misleading title.  The movie does seem to take some easy creative liberties to tie up stories but it's done well and enjoyable the whole way through.  If you enjoyed episodes VII and VIII you will enjoy episode IX.  As usual the critics are off their meds and the audience score is pretty spot on.","displayName":"Kevin M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T06:40:20.976Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T06:40:27.815Z","user":{"userId":"901264509","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kevin M","accountLink":"/user/id/901264509"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A classic Star Wars.

Lots of action from start to finish. A bunch of cool new characters, ships and weapons. The special effects were obviously second to none. A very good ending to a special saga of movies in our lifetime. Cant wait for the next chapter in the would of Star Wars.","displayName":"Chico C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T06:39:28.476Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T06:39:28.476Z","user":{"userId":"bac6bef4-4a1d-40ee-9581-5f46d4cbec61","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chico C","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great characters and storyline.
