Poor resolution of the characters' destjned roles in saving the downtrodden, lazy writing i.e. it just regurgitates previous story arcs without the wit, humour or intelligence and every plot revelation comes with a sledgehammer. I felt completely deflated afterwards, perhaps wait until it comes on TV.","displayName":"Hazel D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10213349093496566/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T19:28:28.614Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T19:28:37.987Z","user":{"userId":"977158768","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hazel D","accountLink":"/user/id/977158768"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"fun crazy fast too much happening but last jedi was so boring there was no choice...  this is basically parts 2 and 3 mixed into 1...  just chill and have fun","displayName":"Thomas A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100005867501760/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T19:28:28.478Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T19:28:28.478Z","user":{"userId":"951218622","realm":"RT","displayName":"Thomas A","accountLink":"/user/id/951218622"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"good movie.  great way to end it.","displayName":"chris r","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T19:28:28.249Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T19:28:28.249Z","user":{"userId":"7B4B2B4F-9740-4723-9BE5-5537D2B74062","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"chris r","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Fan service but ultimately it can pass","displayName":"Jimmy G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T19:28:24.718Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T19:28:24.718Z","user":{"userId":"580C03DA-71F3-45DB-B177-0923A734F8A2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jimmy G","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie!
