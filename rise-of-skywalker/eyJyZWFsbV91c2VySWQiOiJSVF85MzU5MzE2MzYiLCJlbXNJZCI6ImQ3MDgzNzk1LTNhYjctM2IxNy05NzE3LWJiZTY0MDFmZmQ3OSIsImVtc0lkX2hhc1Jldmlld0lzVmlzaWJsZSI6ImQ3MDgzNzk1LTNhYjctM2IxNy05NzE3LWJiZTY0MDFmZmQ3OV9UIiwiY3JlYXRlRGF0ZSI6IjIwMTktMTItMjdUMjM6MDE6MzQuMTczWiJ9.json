J. Abrams spends a good amount of this film righting the wrongs of Rian Johnson. Covering up the many disliked plot points of \"The Last Jedi\", \"The Rise of Skywalker\" almost feels like a new start with Abrams opening up many doors for a bigger universe behind the film's plot. New, likable characters, a great amount of fan service that feels like the director knows a bit about Star Wars' universe and a convoluted but conclusive story that gives the impression, Abrams felt forced to put two films into one. It's only sad to see what could have been, hadn't it been for Johnson's defilement of the sequel saga...","displayName":"Kevin H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T22:58:10.421Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T22:58:22.462Z","user":{"userId":"978485031","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kevin H","accountLink":"/user/id/978485031"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Contrary to what the critics said, The Rise of the Skywalker is an outstanding movie with a gran finale for this amazing saga.
