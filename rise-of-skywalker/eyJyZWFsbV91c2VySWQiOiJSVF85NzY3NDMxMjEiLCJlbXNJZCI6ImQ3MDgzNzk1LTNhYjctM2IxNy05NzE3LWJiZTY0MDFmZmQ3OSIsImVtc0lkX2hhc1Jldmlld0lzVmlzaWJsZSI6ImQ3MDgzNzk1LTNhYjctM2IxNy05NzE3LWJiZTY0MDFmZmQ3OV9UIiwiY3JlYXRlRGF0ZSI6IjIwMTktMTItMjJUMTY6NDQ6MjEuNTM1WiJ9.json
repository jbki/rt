As to this film it has a lot of plotholes, at one point I thought I was watching a \"Dora the explorer\" movie, and there is also the \"copy paste\" from avengers at the \"climax\" of the movie. The one and a half stars are for trying to redeem yourselves about the mistreatment of our beloved characters in the original saga.","displayName":"Alfi P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T16:43:45.452Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T16:44:26.749Z","user":{"userId":"976960439","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alfi P","accountLink":"/user/id/976960439"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"You are never going to please everyone.
