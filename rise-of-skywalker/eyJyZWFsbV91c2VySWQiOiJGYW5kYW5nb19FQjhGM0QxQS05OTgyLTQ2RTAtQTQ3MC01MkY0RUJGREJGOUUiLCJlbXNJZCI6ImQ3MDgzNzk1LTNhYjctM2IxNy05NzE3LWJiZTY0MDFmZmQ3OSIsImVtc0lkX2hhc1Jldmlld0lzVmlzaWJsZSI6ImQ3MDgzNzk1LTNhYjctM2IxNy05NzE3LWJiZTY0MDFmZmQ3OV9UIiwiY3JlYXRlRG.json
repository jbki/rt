It retcons everything in TLJ because Russian bots complained on social media. It destroys Rey character by changing her backstory to something not inspiring. It is always on fast-forward mode rather than play. It stereotypes any ethnic people that it didn't write out. There are so many thins wrong with this movie. However, thank all the right wingers for making this film so horrible, and they were and are backed by a country that has more bots networks than anyone in the world, Russia.","displayName":"Apalm T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/384370938682173/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T04:16:56.509Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:55:31.196Z","user":{"userId":"977026591","realm":"RT","displayName":"Apalm T","accountLink":"/user/id/977026591"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This felt much more like Star Wars than episode 8 (TLJ).
