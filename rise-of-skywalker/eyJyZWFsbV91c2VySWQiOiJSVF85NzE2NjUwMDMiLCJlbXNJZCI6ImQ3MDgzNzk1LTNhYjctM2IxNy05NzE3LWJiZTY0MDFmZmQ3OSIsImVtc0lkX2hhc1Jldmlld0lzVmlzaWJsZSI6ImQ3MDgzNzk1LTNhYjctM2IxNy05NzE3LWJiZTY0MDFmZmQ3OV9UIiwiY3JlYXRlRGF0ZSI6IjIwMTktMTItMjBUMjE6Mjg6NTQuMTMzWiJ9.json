The main story elements feel forced and without logic, I felt uneasy watching certain scenes (with Leia), and the elements that work well are mainly parts of the original thrilogy. I don't feel like watching the movie again. However, it managed to want me to watch the original thrilogy again.","displayName":"Peterfi O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:28:51.798Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:29:00.915Z","user":{"userId":"865348802","realm":"RT","displayName":"Peterfi O","accountLink":"/user/id/865348802"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Satisfying ending for me to an uneven saga.

It was fast paced and enjoyed the ride. I do feel that Disney did not have a clear path as to which way they wanted this trilogy to go.
