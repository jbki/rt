The story overall was ok, but I blame most of my issues on the lack of overall story continuity of the trilogy. I see the issues of the story being due to lack of options. If this story was split into the first half being a movie on its own and the same for the second I feel it would have fixed any issues. \n\nBut as a movie and a star wars movie at that I was thrilled. I had large amounts of bits that I've come to love about star wars. It is a beautifully scored and shot movie so really easy to be taken into this world.","displayName":"Jordan C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:36:15.359Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:36:22.495Z","user":{"userId":"978451437","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jordan C","accountLink":"/user/id/978451437"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"There are definitely some wonky plot elements that feel video-game-like, but I can't deny the emotional impact of this film. The explosive third act is awe-inspiring. The movie is reminiscent of Return of the Jedi in the sense that its profoundly personal character studies and electrifying climax more than make up for the flaws in the story arc.","displayName":"Kris A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:36:08.453Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:36:34.725Z","user":{"userId":"901095606","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kris A","accountLink":"/user/id/901095606"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Thank you J.J.

I found the first 2/3 all over the place, with a script that's a mess, while also trying to introduce and build upon things while at the same time trying to tie things together. The last 1/3 I really enjoyed and loved. \nI think if JJ Abrams had made episode 8, 9 wouldn't feel all over the place because the first 2/3 felt like almost an entirely different movie in my opinion. I think JJ May have introduced to much and had to many planets in this movie. In my opinion instead of introducing all these new things, he could have drawn from more pre-established characters or planets, that way it would have felt less all over the place and we wouldn't of had to focus on both these new things and the development of the main characters and story. At the end of the day though I enjoyed it.","displayName":"Graeson L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1276900989161421/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:36:06.751Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:36:18.241Z","user":{"userId":"978451390","realm":"RT","displayName":"Graeson L","accountLink":"/user/id/978451390"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"As usual, the critics are wrong. Seriously movie critics offer zero value and never agree with audiences so what is their reason for existence?  I really enjoyed this movie! I am a huge Star Wars fan but I went in with low expectations because the previous movie was such a disappointment. This movie is totally worth seeing on the big screen. It is not the best Star Wars movie ever made but it is super fun and well made and has great character dynamics, interesting locations,  and lots of Star Wars action. Update: Jusr saw it again and liked it even better the second time.","displayName":"Dave H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/532521946/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:35:59.332Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T04:37:26.696Z","user":{"userId":"848429197","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dave H","accountLink":"/user/id/848429197"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very entertaining and fun adventure- a very good Star Wars movie, certainly one of the better ones.
