JJ did a fine job making up for Rian Johnson's failure, but it wasn't quite enough. Visually brilliant, but the writing seemed phoned in with a tired cliche of looking for a missing thing to find another hidden thing. There has been almost no real interaction between the characters to give them familiarity or chemistry... so seeing them all together now does very little to give a feeling of history or shared experience.","displayName":"Cross C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T14:11:12.643Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T14:11:22.447Z","user":{"userId":"900634398","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cross C","accountLink":"/user/id/900634398"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"It was OK. The best of the 3 new cast Star Wars but that doesn't say a whole lot.
