It is obvious that they rushed it. There should have been more back story for at least 3 characters. Instead you got almost none on 2 of them and absolutely none on the 3rd. They could have spent 15 minutes on a little more detail and the movie would have been substantially better. It's like Disney just wanted to get this one over with after the horrifically bad reviews of Last Jedi.","displayName":"Sound E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T21:18:12.163Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T21:18:22.874Z","user":{"userId":"978153923","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sound E","accountLink":"/user/id/978153923"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"42 years after seeing the first movie Episode 4.

Most of the movie was throwing out things set up in both movies with quick, careless decisions.\n\nI honestly think that JJ Abrams just superficially apes movies and television scenes that he has seen before without bothering to put them into a proper context of a larger narrative. You could rearrange most of this movie and lose none of the narrative, mostly because it's a very weak narrative.","displayName":"Carl S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T20:47:12.344Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T02:59:59.201Z","user":{"userId":"978475146","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carl S","accountLink":"/user/id/978475146"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"}]}
