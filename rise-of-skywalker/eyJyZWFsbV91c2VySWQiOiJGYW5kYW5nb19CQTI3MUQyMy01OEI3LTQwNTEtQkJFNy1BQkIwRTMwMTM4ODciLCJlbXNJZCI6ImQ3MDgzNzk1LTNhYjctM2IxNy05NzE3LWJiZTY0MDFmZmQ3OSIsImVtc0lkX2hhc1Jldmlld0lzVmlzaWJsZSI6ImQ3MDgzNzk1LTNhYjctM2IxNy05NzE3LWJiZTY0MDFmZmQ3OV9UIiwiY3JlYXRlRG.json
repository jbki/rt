Has it's flaws but is a satisfying end to a trilogy that had lost its way and needed to be found again all in the concluding episode —\nTough to do — and they pull it off — if only barely.","displayName":"Andrew A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T11:41:28.948Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T11:41:56.418Z","user":{"userId":"978498192","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew A","accountLink":"/user/id/978498192"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The pacing on this movie was all off. The first 2/3rds of the movie were a string of fetch quests that didn't seem to actually matter and were mostly filler. The knights of Ren seemed like they were added solely because of the concept art and not because they fit with the plot. The big bad should have been someone else in the Skywalker Saga as this movie invalidates Anakin's role/sacrifice in return of the jedi. Over all I was dissatisfied with the movie and have no plans to watch it again.","displayName":"josh d","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T11:29:18.356Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T11:29:34.055Z","user":{"userId":"978498187","realm":"RT","displayName":"josh d","accountLink":"/user/id/978498187"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie is horrible and I can’t express that enough.
