It undid everything the previous two movies did, all to appease toxic fans who were disappointed with the storytelling of its predecessors‚Äîforced love triangles that come out of nowhere, retconning deaths to add an antagonist, and pandering to the original trilogy simply for the fact of the internet cried hard enough. No decision in this film was made to finish character arcs or progress the overarching story. Every decision was made to appease fans, so the story itself becomes massively convoluted and collapses on itself.
