The messages of hope in the face of adversity, and the act of redemption will always stand the test of time. Children, whether young or adult, need to know they can always come home and be loved, even when they've done terrible things. I'm not a die hard Star Wars fan, but this movie was a fun ride.","displayName":"Shannon E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T15:52:26.111Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T15:52:26.111Z","user":{"userId":"642F037D-047F-4F6B-9AD4-291CE31A0002","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Shannon E","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I was very skeptical that this movie could be good, considering where this trilogy was left after The Last Jedi. I think  JJ did an admirable job picking up the pieces and telling a coherent story. Of course it looked great and the actors are all pretty good. Some of the dialogue was clunky, but I could say that about the majority of SW films. Overall, a fun ride that I would recommend.","displayName":"Matt M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10215637668676736/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T15:52:15.294Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T15:52:20.167Z","user":{"userId":"978240149","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt M","accountLink":"/user/id/978240149"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"One to see!  Try to get in the big screen 3D its beautiful!  Visual candy plus story.  The actors are a bit wooden from direction mistakes, too little emotion for many of the films.  This one is considerably better.  Keeps you guessing until the end and I figure out plot twists early on most of the time.  The ideas are so well executed visually, it almost demands a remake of the 70s films.  I didnt get lost in the effects because the story was compelling.","displayName":"Suzanne D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T15:51:48.200Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T15:51:48.200Z","user":{"userId":"d1df8677-861e-48ee-a3a0-efca35427ff2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Suzanne D","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Disjointed story, poor pacing and confusing.","displayName":"T James W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T15:51:24.551Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T15:51:24.551Z","user":{"userId":"7be32ed0-03b8-4319-b29f-fec51ae3237f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"T James W","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"I can't pretend some of the nostalgia didn't make me tingle a little, but this film feels like three in one. Not the end of a 'saga'. Such a shame that Disney has wasted an almost incredible chance with these films, and The Rise Of SkyWalker in fact damages the original story more than the previous two recent films in the series.","displayName":"Alex M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T15:50:57.759Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T15:51:12.665Z","user":{"userId":"960419910","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex M","accountLink":"/user/id/960419910"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"}]}
