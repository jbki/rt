I understand why some critics think this was made just for the hardcore Star Wars fans, but there's a reason. We would not be watching these movies 40 years after the first one, had they not had hardcore fans. JJ Abrams did the finale justice. Unlike Rian Johnson, who seemed determined to ruin the franchise.
