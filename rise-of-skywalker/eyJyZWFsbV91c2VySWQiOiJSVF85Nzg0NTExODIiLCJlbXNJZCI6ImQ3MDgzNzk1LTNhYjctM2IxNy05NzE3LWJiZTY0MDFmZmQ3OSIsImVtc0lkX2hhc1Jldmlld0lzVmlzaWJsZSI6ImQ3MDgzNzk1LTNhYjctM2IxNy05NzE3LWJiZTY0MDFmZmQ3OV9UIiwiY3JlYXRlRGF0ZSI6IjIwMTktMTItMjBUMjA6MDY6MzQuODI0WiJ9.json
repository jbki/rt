This was the Star Wars-iest Star Wars since Return of the Jedi. Very good movie, great character arc closure for originals, and the most interesting story lines yet for the newbies.

Definitely best of the new trilogy.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:06:08.544Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:06:08.544Z","user":{"userId":"876210054","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/876210054"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A Great conclusion, on to the next saga!","displayName":"Josue","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:05:58.071Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:05:58.071Z","user":{"userId":"2C3CDF6A-661B-4A5C-BAEF-32188E9149F1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Josue","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"As a life-long Star Wars fan, this movie represents an emotional capstone to 42 years of the Skywalker Saga.
