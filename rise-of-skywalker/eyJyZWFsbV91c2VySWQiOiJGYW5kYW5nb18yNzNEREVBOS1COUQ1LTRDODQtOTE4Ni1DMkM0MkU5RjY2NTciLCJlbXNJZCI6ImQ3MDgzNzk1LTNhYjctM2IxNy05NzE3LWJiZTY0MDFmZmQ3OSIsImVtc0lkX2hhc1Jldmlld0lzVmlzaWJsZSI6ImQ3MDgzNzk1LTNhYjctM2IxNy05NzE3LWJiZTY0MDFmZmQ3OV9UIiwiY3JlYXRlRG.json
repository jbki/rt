I was hoping it would somewhat fix this trilogy and instead it made it worse.  There were so many inconsistencies and unanswered questions.  The editing was atrocious.

It lacked everything that made the originals great.","displayName":"Carl L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:00:35.039Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:00:37.735Z","user":{"userId":"977020259","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carl L","accountLink":"/user/id/977020259"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Messy presentation of a super predictable story. The dangers facing the heroes were as banal as the solutions were random. It’s an uninspired remake of Return of the Jedi, which was an uninspired remake of Star Wars. Nevertheless, this Fall of Skywalker is better than I,II, III and Solo. So, sure, go see it, but for goodness’ sake, don’t bother paying for 3D.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:00:29.703Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:00:43.944Z","user":{"userId":"971939303","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/971939303"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This film tries to do a lot in its 2hours and 20 minutes.
