It’s a great ending to a saga that fellow fans take way too seriously. The critics score on RT is exactly why you should see it. Audience Score is much higher on RT which just goes to show you that critics are out of touch with what the public likes. See Skywalker. It’s great. I felt a little sad walking out of the theatre knowing it’s the last time we will see the Skywalker saga. Cheers to the SW Universe future though.","displayName":"Jason R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T22:50:45.679Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T22:50:45.679Z","user":{"userId":"DC20C121-2005-4486-AF35-2046C74B5DF1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jason R","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie - DONT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS!!
