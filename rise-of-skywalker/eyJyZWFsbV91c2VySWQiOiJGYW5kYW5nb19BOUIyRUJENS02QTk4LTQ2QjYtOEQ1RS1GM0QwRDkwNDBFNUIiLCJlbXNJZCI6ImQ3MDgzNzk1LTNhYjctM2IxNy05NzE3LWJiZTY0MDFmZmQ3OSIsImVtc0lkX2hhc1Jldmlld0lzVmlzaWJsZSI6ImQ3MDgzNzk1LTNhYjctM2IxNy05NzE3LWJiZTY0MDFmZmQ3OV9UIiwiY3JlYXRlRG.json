This film is a great end. Yes you may say that it feeds on nostalgia a little bit but when is that bad. It captures George Lucas' world and shows how much you love these characters. I do have a few minor complaints but they are quite small so I won't even bother mentioning at this time.","displayName":"Tom M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T22:36:36.058Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T22:36:42.525Z","user":{"userId":"977628851","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tom M","accountLink":"/user/id/977628851"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Some people say its too much fan fair.

Great action, love the actors and story, the only problem was a little too fast paced. The emotional parts needed a little more time to set in, tears welling and then boom moved on to something else.

This was a very satisfying end to the Skywalker Saga (can we also call it the Palpatine Saga?), and it washed out the bad taste The Last Jedi left in my mouth. It even managed to make The Last Jedi a little more palatable somehow.\nThe humour worked, which was a major complaint I had for TLJ.\nAs a Star Wars fan, it's hard to tick every box on our long wishlists; it's unrealistic to ask that of a filmmaker. J.J. didn't tick every box, but he did tick the most important one for me, \"Make the fans happy\".","displayName":"Kyle A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T22:36:05.534Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T22:36:09.838Z","user":{"userId":"974756273","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kyle A","accountLink":"/user/id/974756273"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Star wars movie to date, loved all of it.","displayName":"Javier","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T22:36:04.536Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T22:36:04.536Z","user":{"userId":"391F2541-F4E8-422D-94ED-897A6201A838","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Javier","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Hilariously terrible","displayName":"Samuel W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/734959509858959/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T22:35:59.009Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T22:36:16.577Z","user":{"userId":"978439673","realm":"RT","displayName":"Samuel W","accountLink":"/user/id/978439673"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I thought this movie was incredibly enjoyable and was very invested throughout","displayName":"Ashley H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1362853864/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T22:35:44.219Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T22:35:50.030Z","user":{"userId":"919542591","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ashley H","accountLink":"/user/id/919542591"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Corrected everything wrong about The Last Jedi, and rightfully so.
