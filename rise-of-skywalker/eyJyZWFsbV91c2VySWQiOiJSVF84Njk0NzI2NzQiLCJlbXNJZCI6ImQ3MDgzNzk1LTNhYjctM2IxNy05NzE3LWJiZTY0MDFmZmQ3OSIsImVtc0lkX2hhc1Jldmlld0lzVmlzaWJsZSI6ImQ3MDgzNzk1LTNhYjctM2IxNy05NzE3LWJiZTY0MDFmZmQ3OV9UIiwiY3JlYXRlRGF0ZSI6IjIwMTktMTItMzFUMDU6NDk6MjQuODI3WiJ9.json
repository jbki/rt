The reviews keep talking about how it tried to \"fix\" The Last Jedi, maybe that's the problem. It just didn't flow. And Rey has become Space Jesus. She's perfect at everything she does. I think she broke a sweat once. There's no reason for her to be humble. She can do whatever she wants. Her power unbalances the force. I left the movie feeling like I did when I found out I was adopted.","displayName":"Tom J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T05:46:17.480Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T05:46:26.370Z","user":{"userId":"976696615","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tom J","accountLink":"/user/id/976696615"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it.
