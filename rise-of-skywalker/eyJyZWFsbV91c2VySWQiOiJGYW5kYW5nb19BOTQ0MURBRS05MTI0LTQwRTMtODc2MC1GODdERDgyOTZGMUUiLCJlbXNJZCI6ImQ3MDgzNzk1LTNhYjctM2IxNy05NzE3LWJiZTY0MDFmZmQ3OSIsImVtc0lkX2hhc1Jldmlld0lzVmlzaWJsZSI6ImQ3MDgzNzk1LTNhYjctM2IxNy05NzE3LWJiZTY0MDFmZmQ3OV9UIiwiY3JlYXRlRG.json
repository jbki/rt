Bouncing around all overt the galaxy with a flimsy storyline.   The rest was laughable.  We were literally lol'ing.  \nDisney completely destroyed this series with the last two movies.   \nIf you like thoughtless bubblegum style movies that don't try to be anything but a mindless popcorn flick,  then this is for you.   If you've followed the series and want things to make sense,  then prepare to be massively disappointed.   \nI did give it more than a star because there's so much to discuss with friends after watching the trash.","displayName":"Geoff","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T14:32:40.630Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T14:32:50.128Z","user":{"userId":"f6333922-de13-46c5-8f27-bd0c2425268b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Geoff","accountLink":null},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Did not meet expectations","displayName":"Logvinov V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/140857807340808/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T14:32:30.923Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T14:32:39.173Z","user":{"userId":"978479947","realm":"RT","displayName":"Logvinov V","accountLink":"/user/id/978479947"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great action and a amazing end to a story","displayName":"Shari J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T14:31:19.641Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T14:31:19.641Z","user":{"userId":"b29bb949-7151-4bf5-a20c-165a525fbedd","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Shari J","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I liked the fan service.
