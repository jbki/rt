Vivid. You'll find good actors too, likeable enough to make your passage through the last few planets Star Wars has for us (for now) quite tolerable. Just don't expect either strokes of genius or a perfect strike on a tried and tested formula; The Rise of Skywalker is a film which feels torn in many directions. It's an employee with many hats and responsibilities. Togetherness and unity are explored and affirmed in a vague way, sure to avoid offending most everyone. You may not be moved, but it's pretty, and a nice galaxy to be in for a couple of hours.","displayName":"Dominic N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T23:26:24.574Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T23:26:32.629Z","user":{"userId":"978499374","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dominic N","accountLink":"/user/id/978499374"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I liked how they had the old characters do cameos.","displayName":"Cathy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T23:23:06.015Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T23:23:06.015Z","user":{"userId":"b4449dfc-d58d-4f60-bedd-6186a01db5e6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Cathy","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"}]}
