You get a series of events that are loosely tied together with the thinnest layer of plot.  They hit you over the head with scenes ripped from past star wars films and what the hell happened to the new republic?? You get this feeling that there are 10 ships in the \"resistance\".  Gone are the Mon Calamari fleets, the Corellian, the Nebulon B cruisers.  You get one blockade runner, and a smattering of fighters. They have a few old Y wings which are antiques by the time of Episode 4 yet they serve along with a few a wings and x wings....  The plot twist with the New Order traitor was.. annoying more then anything, and the family reveal for the main character was over played.  \n\nThere where parts of the film that gave me a bit of motion sickness as the camera would. not. be. still.  You can move a camera through a ships corridor scene during pitched intense battles and NOT have a drunken Gungan holding the camera.  Seriously, Jar Jar was the camera man for half the shots in this film!!  The whole concept of the final order fleet and how it met its end is just ... lazy, boring, and ridiculous.   Its scifi / fantasy so you do have to suspend your beliefs and use your imagination, but this was so poorly executed that it felt like a fan film with cool CGI and nothing else.  \n\nGranted, it DOES have some good parts.   The scenes with Carrie Fisher tugged at my heart strings.. then you see the BS plot around her and your like \"wait..wut???\"  I threw my hands up 7 times during this film (my best friend kept count, laughing each time) and I liked Lando's return but.. again, \"wait .. wut???\" \n\nI am personally glad this is the final star wars film.  The spinnoffs such as Mandalorian, Rouge One, and Clonewars/Rebels show that projects helmed under directors/producers who respect the Star Wars universe and focus on the rich vibrant story and add their own touches that enhance that universe can be successful.   \n\nToo much of this film is director ego, franchise merchandising and the focus of a drunken sailor on leave after a 6 month underway.","displayName":"Don E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2896181573726035/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-23T17:58:29.520Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T17:58:44.013Z","user":{"userId":"978470690","realm":"RT","displayName":"Don E","accountLink":"/user/id/978470690"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The thing that really sticks out to me about this movie is its desire to undo everything from the previous film. In doing so, it loses the possibility of saying or doing anything new for the franchise, and instead feels like a corpse of tired ideas brought back to life for one last attempt at pilfering your wallet. Palpatine's presence is wholly unnecessary, and takes away from Kylo as a villain. The film moves so quickly that it's hard to feel anything for the characters, let alone to understand what the plot is supposed to be. They don't give you enough time to care before it's off to the next planet. The half star is only for the performances of the actors, which were fine amidst this truly soulless attempt by disney to win back a portion of the fanbase.","displayName":"Scott W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/525752223/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T17:58:14.617Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T17:58:20.831Z","user":{"userId":"916625552","realm":"RT","displayName":"Scott W","accountLink":"/user/id/916625552"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"without giving anything away.

Its easy to be picky as like it is with most movies, but as a big Star Wars fan I enjoyed what they did with characters and the plot.
