However, fans of the franchise will find it hard to ignore that this conclusion to the saga is shallow, unoriginal, and inconsistent with the other eight films. The potential for an epic, satisfying conclusion exists in this movie, but even the best moments lack the foundation necessary to bring them home. This movie is visually fantastic and exciting, but if you want to enjoy it, try not to think too much about it.","displayName":"Kip B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:15:56.778Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:15:56.778Z","user":{"userId":"978466354","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kip B","accountLink":"/user/id/978466354"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I cry at the end, don’t listen to haters!
