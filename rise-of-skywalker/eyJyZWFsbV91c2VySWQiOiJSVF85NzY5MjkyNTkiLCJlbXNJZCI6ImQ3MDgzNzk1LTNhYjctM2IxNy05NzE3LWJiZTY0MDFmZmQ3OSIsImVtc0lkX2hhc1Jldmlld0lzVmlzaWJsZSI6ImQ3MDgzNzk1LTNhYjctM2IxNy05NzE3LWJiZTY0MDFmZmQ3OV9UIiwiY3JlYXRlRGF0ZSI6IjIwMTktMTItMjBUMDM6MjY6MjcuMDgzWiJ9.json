Take some popcorn, guacamole, a slice of pizza and a meatball, and that’s what this movie felt like. There were nice moments, and they really tried, but they were essentially trying to tell a trilogy in one movie. However, the best of the 3.","displayName":"Lori J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T03:25:03.686Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T21:06:52.780Z","user":{"userId":"34404ED6-8D2B-41BA-AA2B-747589671493","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Lori J","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Positives:\nEpic  scope\nNon-stop action\nLots of fan service\n\nMixed:\nSo fast paced it's almost overwhelming\nOne moment I wish they would take back (don't want to spoil)\nOverall lack of attachment\n\nCon:\nSome real goofy moments\nNo heart","displayName":"Jeffrey D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/530171805/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T03:24:30.991Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T22:27:51.156Z","user":{"userId":"792634224","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeffrey D","accountLink":"/user/id/792634224"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I approach this with the same love that I do every star wars movie and I was not disappointed. I enjoyed the nostalgia, I enjoyed the characters, and I enjoyed the parts that didn't quite make sense (there were a few). I didn't go in expecting a cinematic masterpiece, but I got a satisfying endpoint to a franchise that I've always loved. Optimists will find plenty to enjoy, and critics will be critical. But I recommend all star wars fans give it a chance and form your own opinions. Personally, I was not disappointed.","displayName":"Charlie A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T03:23:50.980Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T06:43:12.650Z","user":{"userId":"83D14F68-67B5-438E-BF40-ECB503C23D3B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Charlie A","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I'm not sure why there's so much hate for this movie because it is a fun and emotional ride from start to finish. Yes some things could be handled differently but those missteps didn't derail the movie for me. It is worth watching and I'll be watching it again.
