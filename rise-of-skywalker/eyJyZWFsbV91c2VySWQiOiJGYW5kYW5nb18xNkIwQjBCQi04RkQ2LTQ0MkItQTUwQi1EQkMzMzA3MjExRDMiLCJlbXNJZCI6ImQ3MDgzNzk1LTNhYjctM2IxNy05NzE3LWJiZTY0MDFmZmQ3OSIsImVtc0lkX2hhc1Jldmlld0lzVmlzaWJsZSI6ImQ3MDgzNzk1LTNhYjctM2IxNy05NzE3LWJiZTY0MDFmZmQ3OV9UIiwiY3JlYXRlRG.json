The issue is some was answered in a way of they didn't care and other created more plot holes. All issues aside JJ did a good job cleaning up the mess of The Last Jedi. But the ending was horrible. The worst ending of the final chapters of the 3 sagas. Ep. 6 and Ep. 3 was way better in fact it bearly beats out Ep. 1, Ep. 2 and The Last Jedi.","displayName":"Eric W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3028070543870261/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:32:17.141Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:32:21.253Z","user":{"userId":"978471166","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eric W","accountLink":"/user/id/978471166"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"If you like nostalgia and fast paced action this movie is great!

This movie was great. That answered questions the first two sequels asked. It moved at a brisk pace. It did not seem to drag on. It felt like Star Wars again. It saw most of the main characters together again throughout the film. End it had enough callbacks to make the lifelong fans feel reminiscent.","displayName":"Scott M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10220141959133686/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:30:47.704Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:30:53.110Z","user":{"userId":"978471154","realm":"RT","displayName":"Scott M","accountLink":"/user/id/978471154"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I thought it was a great trilogy, and a great way to wrap the movies up. I think the fans are being way too harsh and are some of the most entitled in any fan base out there. Are there problems? Sure, it’s not perfect. But it’s a great Star Wars movie, super entertaining, and I found myself wanting  more from these characters in the future which is sad because we won’t get that.","displayName":"Tyler M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:30:08.185Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:30:08.185Z","user":{"userId":"856C96AC-707C-4A65-945B-B7F12FF23C4A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tyler M","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"way better than 8 but could be better","displayName":"Leandro P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:29:54.715Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:29:54.715Z","user":{"userId":"978471167","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leandro P","accountLink":"/user/id/978471167"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Ruined the franchise, anakins build up to becoming the chosen one is now pointless","displayName":"Cameron L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1281320548736519/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:29:17.465Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:29:24.452Z","user":{"userId":"978471169","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cameron L","accountLink":"/user/id/978471169"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"For me, this movie is not the end of the Skywalker saga,\nit's just one more DISNEY movie about Star Wars","displayName":"Luis F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10214411437456760/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:29:11.543Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:29:30.072Z","user":{"userId":"977044540","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luis F","accountLink":"/user/id/977044540"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Paid homage to the original trilogy and characters, kind of tied the knot.
