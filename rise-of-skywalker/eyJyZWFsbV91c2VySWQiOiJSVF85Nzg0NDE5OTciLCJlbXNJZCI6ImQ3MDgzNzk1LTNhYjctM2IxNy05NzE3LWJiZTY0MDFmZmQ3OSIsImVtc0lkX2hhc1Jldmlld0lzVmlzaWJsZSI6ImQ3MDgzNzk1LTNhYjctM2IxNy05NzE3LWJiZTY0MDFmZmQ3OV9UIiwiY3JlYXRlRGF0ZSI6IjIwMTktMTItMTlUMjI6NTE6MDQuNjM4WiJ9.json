Ho hum ending that was so cliche.  Killed off the wrong character.\nRey just became annoying in the end. Special Effects were great in death star scene.\nI think Disney forgot the age range of their true Star Wars fans.  Really this was a Disney movie not Lucas.  Shame for the last one.","displayName":"Margaret c","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:50:53.167Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:50:53.167Z","user":{"userId":"978441981","realm":"RT","displayName":"Margaret c","accountLink":"/user/id/978441981"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Understand the critics' complaints, and obviously the â€˜galaxy's only hope' narrative has been done to death, but the character arcs and the pure Star Wars fandom satisfaction is wonderful.
