When it's hard to choose either TLJ or this movie as the worst star wars movie, you screwed up. The constant jumps, the fact that we make the force something that ruins prior movies. It is clear that they never watched the prior movies, and that they have no concept of the grand picture of how these things effect the over arching story. MUCHLESS in their own trilogy. They pick and choose what they want to remember and not what is true.","displayName":"Alex P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10216013671515136/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T20:48:09.324Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T20:48:20.368Z","user":{"userId":"978451795","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex P","accountLink":"/user/id/978451795"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"We loved it just hope it keeps going maybe with a different story","displayName":"Renee J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T20:47:35.485Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T20:47:35.485Z","user":{"userId":"67872E5F-D58B-4089-B6B8-FD7735EE5967","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Renee J","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"}]}
