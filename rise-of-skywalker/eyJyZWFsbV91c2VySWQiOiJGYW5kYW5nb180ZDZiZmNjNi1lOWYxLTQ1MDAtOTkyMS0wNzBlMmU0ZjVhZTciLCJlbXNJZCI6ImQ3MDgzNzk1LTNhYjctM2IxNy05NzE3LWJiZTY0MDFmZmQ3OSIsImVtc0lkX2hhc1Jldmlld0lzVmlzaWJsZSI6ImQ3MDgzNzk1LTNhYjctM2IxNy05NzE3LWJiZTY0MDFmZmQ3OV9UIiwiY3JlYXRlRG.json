Finn spends most of the time shouting after Rey and Poe gets a back story which goes nowhere.\nYes, JJ tries to amend the error filled TLJ but if they bothered to do any fan research, they would know how angry fans were with the way Luke, Hann and Leia were portrayed in the last 2 movies.\nThe biggest curses are the disrespect to Anakin and Luke by bringing back Palpatine, but then JJ did not have much to work on seeing TLJ killed off the main antagonist.  \nThe actors deserved much better. Plus, points – Kylo's performance, visually stunning and…..nope that's it!","displayName":"Cole l","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T22:20:32.720Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T22:20:32.720Z","user":{"userId":"978461157","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cole l","accountLink":"/user/id/978461157"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"too Disney... storyline was predictable. action was good but way too uneven.","displayName":"Joseph D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T22:19:00.482Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T22:19:00.482Z","user":{"userId":"463F63E1-5181-44C5-B3D9-3FC60EF1DA36","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joseph D","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Fun movie.
