However, as the plot begins to slow down we start to see the glaring holes between plot devices.\n\nAfter 9 fake deaths, 2 macguffins, a programming restriction, and a few more useless plot devices - the audience gets tired of JJ's attempt to tread water and use nostalgia to keep the movie afloat. \n\nThese basic issues, combined with a lack of regard for canon material (Kylo & Poe's comic runs are both neglected + the last jedi is insulted by this movie), leave the end of the Skywalker Saga on a sour note.","displayName":"A R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T17:01:23.452Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T17:01:27.438Z","user":{"userId":"978477240","realm":"RT","displayName":"A R","accountLink":"/user/id/978477240"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"I saw the original Star Wars as a kid on opening night at Graumans Chinese Theater. And to have it end like this just pissed me off. Everyone involved with this fiasco needs to be FIRED! They have zero clue of Star Wars and its lore. Forget just the ability to write decent dialogue or even a decent fantasy story. This was written in such a way that there was zero root in reality. Everything is over the top. Rey is basically Jesus now, lmfao. But hey she has had a year to train so it makes total sense. They don't even explain how the emperor survived. The actors did the best they could but with material this bad there is no saving it. The lightsaber duels look like kids in the front yard banging sticks together. The fan service is insulting it is so cheap and blatant. They clearly had no overarching story threads for all 3 when they set out to make this trilogy. It is all over the place.
