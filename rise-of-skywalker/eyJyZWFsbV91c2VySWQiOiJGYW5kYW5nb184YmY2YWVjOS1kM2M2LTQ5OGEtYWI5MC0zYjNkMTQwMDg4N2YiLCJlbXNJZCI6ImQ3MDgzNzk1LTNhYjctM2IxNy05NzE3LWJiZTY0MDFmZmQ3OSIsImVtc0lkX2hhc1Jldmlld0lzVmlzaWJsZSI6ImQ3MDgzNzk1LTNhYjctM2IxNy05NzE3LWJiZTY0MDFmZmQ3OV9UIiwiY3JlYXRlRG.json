I felt like the dry humor was back without trying to push the humor.  It was a great ending to a series we probably all started as young children.  There were a few things that obviously stood out that I could have done without but I definitely will go back and see this a little more relaxed now that I know what happens.  Revisiting those past characters was definitely a bonus.  It was an ending that had closure.","displayName":"Stagar30","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T16:46:02.896Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T16:46:02.896Z","user":{"userId":"958ae090-47c2-4a95-8dc0-6ca0d1525daa","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Stagar30","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Action packed movie that does a great job of tying up the Skywalker Saga","displayName":"Doug","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T16:45:47.117Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T16:45:47.117Z","user":{"userId":"2969dc12-cc5a-4783-b500-108eabce71aa","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Doug","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The action was non-stop and mindblowing!
