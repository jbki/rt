One of the few scene's I liked was when Luke Skywalker showed up as a force ghost and caught the lightsaber Rey was throwing into a fire. Then said, \" A Jedi's weapon deserves more respect\". A shot I think at Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi when he made Luke toss his light saber over his shoulder as a cheap joke...","displayName":"Chris R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1537893281/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T05:39:35.775Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T05:39:44.153Z","user":{"userId":"931635520","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris R","accountLink":"/user/id/931635520"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!
