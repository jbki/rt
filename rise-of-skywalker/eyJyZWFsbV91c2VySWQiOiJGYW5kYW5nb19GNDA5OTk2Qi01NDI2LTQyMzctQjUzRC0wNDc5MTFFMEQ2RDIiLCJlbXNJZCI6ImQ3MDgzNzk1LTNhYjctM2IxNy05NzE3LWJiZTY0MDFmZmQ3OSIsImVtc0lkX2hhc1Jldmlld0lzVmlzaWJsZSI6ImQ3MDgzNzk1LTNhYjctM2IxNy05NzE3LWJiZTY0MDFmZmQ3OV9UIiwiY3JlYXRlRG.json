I actually enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would, as The Last Jedi didn't give me high hopes for the next. The 1st hour is basically its own movie, what Episode 8 probably should've been. There are moments that should've been more impactful as a SW fan, but they don't because of how sloppy the new trilogy is. Definitely not the worst Star Wars movie, but not one I'd ever buy or even watch again.","displayName":"Chloe Lewis","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T12:00:43.912Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T12:00:44.914Z","user":{"userId":"11e58bbc-6eb4-4fb5-a965-6968817c3595","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chloe Lewis","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A little fast paced in spots.
