What started as possible fan service in the movie inevitably felt like a disservice to the far better Star Wars movies of the past. \n\nOverall, SWTROS tries to save itself from the inevitable catastrophe it was doomed to be (from directing swaps to writing dilemmas) in what unfortunately becomes a murder-suicide of not only present but past Star Wars films.","displayName":"Chance S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T08:14:51.292Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:50:43.828Z","user":{"userId":"978017966","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chance S","accountLink":"/user/id/978017966"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Good movie... entertaining and worth your time..","displayName":"Mimimcmillon","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T08:13:28.942Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T08:13:28.942Z","user":{"userId":"6540504B-86E3-49BC-A9AB-2FC551824081","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mimimcmillon","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Iâ€™ve felt like Disney kinda ruined Star Wars honestly.
