This doesn't star wars. It will get a high audience review because it is fun, and has many flashing lights, but this isn't a movie you think about. This is an objectively bad movie for 2 hours and has redeeming qualities in the last 30 minutes. The 30 minutes are some of the best of new star wars but then again, that's not saying much.\n\n2nd worst movie IMO. Only ahead of A New Hope.
