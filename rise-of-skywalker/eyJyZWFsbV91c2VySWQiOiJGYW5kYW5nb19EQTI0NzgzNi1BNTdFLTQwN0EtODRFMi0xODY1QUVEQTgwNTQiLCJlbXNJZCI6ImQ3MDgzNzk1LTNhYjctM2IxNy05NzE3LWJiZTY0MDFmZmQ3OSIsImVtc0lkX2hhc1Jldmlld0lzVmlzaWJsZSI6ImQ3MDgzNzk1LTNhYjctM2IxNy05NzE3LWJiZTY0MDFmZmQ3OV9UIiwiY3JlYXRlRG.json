This film ruins the ending of Anakin's arc in the first six films. Rey is now only almost a Mary Sue. In firm honesty, it feels like this film is in a wrestling match with TLJ. A good movie in a vacuum, but adding the context of the other films drops the rating further. Fan service that felt at times like fan fiction(bad), and fan service that felt like love notes from George Lucas himself (good). Yet still not the fan service everyone wanted: Obi-Wan force ghost, Anakin Force Ghost, etc. \n\nThe Knights of Ren were the biggest disappointment in the film, after their revels in EP7 and lack of showing in EP8 they were finally shown in the film. Only to be revealed to be a bunch of cannon fodder. This leads to probably the greatest critique of the film, this should have been at least a three hour film. Two hours and twenty minutes was not enough, thus story arcs feel jerky at times in pacing.","displayName":"Brian D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:51:09.340Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:51:09.340Z","user":{"userId":"978453044","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian D","accountLink":"/user/id/978453044"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"A pathetic attempt to close off the Skywalker saga practically undoing everything that the original Lucas films established and negating an actually well developed story. There are a multitude of plot holes that either are never explained or explained so poorly JJ has no choice but to wipe to a different scene every 10 seconds at breakneck pace. The only solace I could find in the film was the acting by Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, Daisy Ridley, and John Boyega, as well as the score, but even that one was derivative and at times beyond cheesy. Palpatine was a joke. The movie spent half of its time undoing the last one. 1/5 would not recommend. Attack of the Clones was better.","displayName":"Alexandru I","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000368516670/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:51:09.088Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:51:13.211Z","user":{"userId":"915353387","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alexandru I","accountLink":"/user/id/915353387"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I really enjoyed the movie.
