This was not a love letter to Star Wars fan and a movie to win over a new generation of Star Wars fans but a Disney Star Wars cash grab. I’m just disappointed because I like the trio of Rey, Poe, and Finn but none of them feel like the characters were developed very well. The good thing is the lightsaber fights and action are decent.","displayName":"Will","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T15:50:20.106Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T15:50:20.106Z","user":{"userId":"359C82A8-1F91-4BEC-B837-89FB422C9BD3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Will","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love Star Wars, and this movie gets Star Wars right to me. Yes it moves at breakneck speed, Yes it refers back to the rest of the saga at times, some may consider it fan service, but I quite enjoyed it. I thought there was plenty of new stuff as well. I loved the Camaraderie between the characters. It got the humor right, as I thought the last movie (TLJ) failed in this regard. It took advantage of what worked in that movie, and grew on it. It had several amazing emotional payoffs for me. Despite what many of the critics are saying seeing it the second time really helped solidify my original feeling that this is a really FUN, EMOTIONALLY REWARDING, FITTING CONCLUSION.","displayName":"Jbroadbent","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T15:49:25.803Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T15:49:25.803Z","user":{"userId":"0a13c8a8-f6bb-4b2b-8c7c-11c61f540eca","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jbroadbent","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"GREAT STORY THAT TIES A LOT OF THE PIECES TOGETHER.
