The Disney writers put themselves in a hole because of their lack connective vision. I hope to never see JJ Abrams attached to another Star Wars project. It started slow but finished strong .  The story arcs of main characters just werent flushed out, it felt like they were just trying to salvage something (Rey). Bringing back the Palpatine with little to no explanation was lazy.  I like the flash to Leias training, it gave everyone some brief idea that she was a potent force user.  The Lucas story group should have been allowed to shape this trilogy. They would have done so much better. It could  have then become what it SHOULD have been. It is the best of the sequel trilogy, but in the end that is what it should have been.","displayName":"Andy K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:44:35.143Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:44:35.143Z","user":{"userId":"bdeb919e-8cd5-46dc-b7e3-2c4f63360bfc","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Andy K","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Went into it with no expectations. A life-long love of Star Wars has been disappointed so often that the excitement was gone.  But it was amazing.  Action, Comedy, Tears.

Great action, the music is amazing, Rey, Ben Solo and Palpatine are the standouts of the movie.

Instead we got... no imagination, no love, discontinuing of aspects that have always been in the core of Star Wars and super fast action sequences. If you aren't a massive Star Wars fan and just want to see good versus evil in such an extreme way it feels like a poorly written video game about devils and angels then you'll probably enjoy it. This isn't Star Wars. \n\nHopefully someone buys Star Wars from Disney and starts again at episode 7. This is not at all in the style of George Lucas and even defies things pre-established from previous movies.","displayName":"Rhys J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001123387778/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:43:54.381Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:44:01.269Z","user":{"userId":"948710887","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rhys J","accountLink":"/user/id/948710887"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A great way to finish the saga üëçüèª","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:43:53.271Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:43:53.271Z","user":{"userId":"975091818","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/975091818"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"}]}
