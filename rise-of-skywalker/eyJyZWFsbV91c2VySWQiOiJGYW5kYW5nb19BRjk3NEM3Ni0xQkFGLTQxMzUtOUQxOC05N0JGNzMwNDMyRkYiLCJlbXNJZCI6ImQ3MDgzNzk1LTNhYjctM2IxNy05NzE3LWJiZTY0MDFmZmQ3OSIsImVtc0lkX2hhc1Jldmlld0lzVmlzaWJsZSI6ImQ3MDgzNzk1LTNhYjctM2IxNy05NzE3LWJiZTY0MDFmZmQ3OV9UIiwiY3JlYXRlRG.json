Understand that it’s been rated low by critics because this movie doesn’t stand on its own. TROS has an expedited plot and relies on its viewers being familiar with its predecessors. If you consider yourself a passionate fan of the Skywalker films, this movie will undoubtedly provide you with the satisfying closure you are looking for.
