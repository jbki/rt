JJ retcons episode 8 and rewrote 8and 9 together. But it just doesn't work. This trilogy is definitely not canon or George Lucas approved. With that said as a standalone movie it's a 6.5/10. As a true Star Wars film it's a 2/10.","displayName":"Brandon L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:34:12.923Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:34:17.021Z","user":{"userId":"978445742","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brandon L","accountLink":"/user/id/978445742"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie of the year","displayName":"ALEX","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:34:12.201Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:34:12.201Z","user":{"userId":"F944A72D-6DF5-4D34-934A-D979A3704B95","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"ALEX","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Well the cast performances did the best they could with a poorly conceived notion it's far from what the quality you would expect from JJ Abrams. this may have been better is a two-part so that they could have actually explained some of the lame answers that were just dropped along the path the close off the Skywalker story","displayName":"Rob C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000571309385/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:34:11.916Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:34:19.649Z","user":{"userId":"947797006","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rob C","accountLink":"/user/id/947797006"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"You truly have to go into seeing this film with an open mind to understand how well it was truly made.","displayName":"Aidan V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:34:08.349Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:34:10.602Z","user":{"userId":"978445786","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aidan V","accountLink":"/user/id/978445786"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely epic.

Lackluster villian who's been over used......jedis have multiple lives....Kylo is just a plot device. Supporting characters get tossed aside. Then it follows the familiar pattern of Return of The Jedi, where Luke dissapears to follow his path and convert Darth while his friends battle in ships...Rey does the same thing throughout the movie. In fact the final scene is copied exactly from Return Of The Jedi where Palpatine shows Luke his friends losing the war and asks him to strike down Vader. Palpatine shows Rey her friends losing and asks her to strike him down..,, so sad and not very creative. They had great material with Force Awakens and tossed it down the drain.","displayName":"Mandy M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1980545288878374/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:45.510Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:49.105Z","user":{"userId":"976862059","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mandy M","accountLink":"/user/id/976862059"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"rotten tomatoes critics are the worst when they give low score  that means the movie real good! this is the best star wars movie since empire strikes back. glad lucas is not involved any more...","displayName":"greg i","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:45.161Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:33:52.267Z","user":{"userId":"627137791","realm":"RT","displayName":"greg i","accountLink":"/user/id/627137791"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
