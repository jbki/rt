I missed a lot of allusions to the other movies and characters during the first viewing and I was able to enjoy the movie for what it is so much more. I loved the comedic moments (especially Finn, really great) and really loved the relationship development between Rey and Kylo Ren. I love KR's intensity, it really made the movie for me. It was also nice to not have all the 'surprises' that came with watching it the first time.","displayName":"gatornic","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T00:22:40.458Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T00:22:40.458Z","user":{"userId":"9c1b481f-2841-4323-9b38-5321e0ac72b9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"gatornic","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved it!
