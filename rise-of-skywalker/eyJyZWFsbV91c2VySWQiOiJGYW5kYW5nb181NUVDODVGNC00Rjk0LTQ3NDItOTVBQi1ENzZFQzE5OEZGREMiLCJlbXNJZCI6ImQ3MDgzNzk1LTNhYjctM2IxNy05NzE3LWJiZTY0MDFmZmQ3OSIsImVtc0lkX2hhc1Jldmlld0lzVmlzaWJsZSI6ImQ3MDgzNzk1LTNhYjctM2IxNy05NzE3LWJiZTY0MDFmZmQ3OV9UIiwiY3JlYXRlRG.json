The pacing of the film is too fast, causing most moments that should feel impactful to fall disappointingly flat. Avid followers of Star Wars might enjoy the odd easter egg, but after a while even these get tiresome and feel forced. Not a complete waste of time but it's a tepid end to a trilogy that failed to recapture the Star Wars magic despite a promising start with The Force Awakens.","displayName":"LD W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:36:24.880Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T18:08:58.710Z","user":{"userId":"977197759","realm":"RT","displayName":"LD W","accountLink":"/user/id/977197759"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The way the force has been increased from previous movies and Leahâ€™s training not revealed until the very end... would have been better explained in Episode 8.
