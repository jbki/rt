The knock I keep reading is there about 2.5 movies worth of plot jammed into this movie which means some of the bigger moments don't really get their chance to breath. This is fair. However, you must understand that this is not a stand alone movie, so it not only is graded on it's own merit - it is graded in context of how it fits into the larger narrative over all. Look, love Last Jedi or hate it, it did not move the arch of a trilogy forward enough because it picked up directly after TFA and then created it's own story arch; it did not really carry too much of the TFA story along. So that being the case it created a lot of questions to be answered. Combine that with they killed off the trilogy villain Snoke, so now in your final act you basically have a TON of plot to unpack. It was done as well as could be hoped for. We got a very fresh take on mythology, the villain was satisfying, the saga resolution was satisfying, they pulled off the Leia stuff in a way that wasn't forced. So yeah, it's a ton of plot unloaded at light speed and there's definitely some \"are we sure this makes sense?\" moments, but it's not the trash fire these goofy ass critics say it is. It's damned good, it's worth your time and money, and it's got high re-watch value.","displayName":"Josh P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10219821011386388/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:41:53.567Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:41:56.964Z","user":{"userId":"978239732","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josh P","accountLink":"/user/id/978239732"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Fun movie!

The story is very hard to follow and there are so many things that happen that I was just amazed by. In a bad way. I grew up with Star Wars and went into it with low expectations.
