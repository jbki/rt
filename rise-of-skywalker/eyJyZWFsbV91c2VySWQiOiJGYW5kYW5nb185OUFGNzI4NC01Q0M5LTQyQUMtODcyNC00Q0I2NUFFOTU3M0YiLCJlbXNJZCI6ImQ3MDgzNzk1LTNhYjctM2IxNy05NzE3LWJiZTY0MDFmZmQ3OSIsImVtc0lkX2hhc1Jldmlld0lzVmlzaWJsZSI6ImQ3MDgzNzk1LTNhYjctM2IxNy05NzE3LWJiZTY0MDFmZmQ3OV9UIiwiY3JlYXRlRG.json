It's different, but caps off the saga nicely. Some bold moves with the storyline, which was great to see because they could have easily fell into the trap of duplicating the original trilogy.

A true Star Wars movie! The first part was a little slow and also you could see with Carrie Fisher they tried their best to work around the scraps of footage they had so sometimes those scenes came out a little wooden. The second and third act speeded up and it got better and better. And then the ending was truly epic. Highly recommend.
