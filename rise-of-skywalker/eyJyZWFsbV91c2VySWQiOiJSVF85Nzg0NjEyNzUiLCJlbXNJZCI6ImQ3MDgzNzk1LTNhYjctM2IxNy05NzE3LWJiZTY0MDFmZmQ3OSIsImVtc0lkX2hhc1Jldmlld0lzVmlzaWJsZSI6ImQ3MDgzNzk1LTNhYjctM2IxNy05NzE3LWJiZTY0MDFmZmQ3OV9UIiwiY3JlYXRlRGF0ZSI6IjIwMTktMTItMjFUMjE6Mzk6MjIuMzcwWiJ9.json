I had a lot of trepidation because of the wobbly reviews, and I have to say that after seeing it I am dumbfounded as we why it would score so low. This film is an incredible achievement. It brings together the themes and character stories in a way that is compelling, emotional and satisfying. It's also heaps of fun and an incredibly immersive Star Wars experience. I saw it with my wife, who carries none of the Star Wars fandom baggage or toxicity and none of the critic's pretensions, and she loved it. This film does require some emotional intelligence, which I've noticed isn't abundant online - so maybe that's a problem. Anyway, go see it.","displayName":"Geoff S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:38:12.914Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:38:15.442Z","user":{"userId":"978461228","realm":"RT","displayName":"Geoff S","accountLink":"/user/id/978461228"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Rise of Skywalker is a very good but flawed send off to the Skywalker saga","displayName":"Austin C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:38:11.545Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:38:25.691Z","user":{"userId":"977677526","realm":"RT","displayName":"Austin C","accountLink":"/user/id/977677526"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very happy with the conclusion to the Skywalker saga.","displayName":"Michael P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000046498443/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:38:09.051Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:38:14.056Z","user":{"userId":"915842410","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael P","accountLink":"/user/id/915842410"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"}]}
