It was a very safe Star Wars movie. I think they could have taken a few more risks and there were things I wish they had done differently, but overall it was okay. If you're looking for a grand masterpiece, this isn't it. It's a good movie to put on for a couple of hours and watch the end of the Skywalker saga. (Though there is enough wiggle room for Disney to squeeze out more spinoff movies, which they probably will.)","displayName":"Stephanie W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T02:49:51.263Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T02:50:03.344Z","user":{"userId":"978192987","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stephanie W","accountLink":"/user/id/978192987"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Deeply disappointing following Episode VIII.","displayName":"CURTIS S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T02:48:39.332Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T02:48:39.332Z","user":{"userId":"978499753","realm":"RT","displayName":"CURTIS S","accountLink":"/user/id/978499753"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"}]}
