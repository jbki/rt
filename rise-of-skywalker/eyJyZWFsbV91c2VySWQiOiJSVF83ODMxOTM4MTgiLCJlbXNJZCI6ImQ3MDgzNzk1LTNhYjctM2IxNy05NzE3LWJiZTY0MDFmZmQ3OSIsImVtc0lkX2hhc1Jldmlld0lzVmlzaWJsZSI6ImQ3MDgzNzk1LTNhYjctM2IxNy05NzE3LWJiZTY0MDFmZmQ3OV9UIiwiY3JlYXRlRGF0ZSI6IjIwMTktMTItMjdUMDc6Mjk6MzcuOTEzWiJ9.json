I don't understand the mediocre reviews. This was the best Star Wars except for maybe Episode IV. The story made sense, there was plenty of action and Rey's actions actually made sense throughout. While I would have liked to have seen a more direct role for Gen. Leia, what was there made sense. I think Abrams did a great job. Highly recommended.","displayName":"Excellent movie, unless you've never seen any of the other Star Wars Movies.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T07:29:26.976Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T07:29:26.976Z","user":{"userId":"4fd8699f-65cf-4d91-9ce4-d93c2edaceda","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Excellent movie, unless you've never seen any of the other Star Wars Movies.","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Beginning half too slow...got better second half!","displayName":"Deanne J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T07:27:49.418Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T07:27:49.418Z","user":{"userId":"9F87247C-7891-49D8-9054-C166817617A0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Deanne J","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"a little too much fan service but overall pretty good","displayName":"Tim H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T07:26:31.336Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T07:26:31.336Z","user":{"userId":"387790A8-8845-480A-B991-FD87AB62826D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tim H","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great ending to the saga.","displayName":"lady_fett","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T07:23:21.909Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T07:23:21.909Z","user":{"userId":"D8BC77FC-EF1A-43BC-8026-FA3F787F95C2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"lady_fett","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome, i loved it!","displayName":"Stevie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T07:23:15.765Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T07:23:15.765Z","user":{"userId":"48827FAC-0E66-41A2-8FA3-788B4337727E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Stevie","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I thought it was a great movie","displayName":"Donald","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T07:22:53.703Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T07:22:53.703Z","user":{"userId":"43a795da-1b62-47a9-90d1-d91cace8547d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Donald","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I think it was a good end to an epic story.","displayName":"K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T07:19:03.481Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T07:19:03.481Z","user":{"userId":"5277aa2d-7bf9-443b-9bef-c55ed4a70b4b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"K","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Ugh.
