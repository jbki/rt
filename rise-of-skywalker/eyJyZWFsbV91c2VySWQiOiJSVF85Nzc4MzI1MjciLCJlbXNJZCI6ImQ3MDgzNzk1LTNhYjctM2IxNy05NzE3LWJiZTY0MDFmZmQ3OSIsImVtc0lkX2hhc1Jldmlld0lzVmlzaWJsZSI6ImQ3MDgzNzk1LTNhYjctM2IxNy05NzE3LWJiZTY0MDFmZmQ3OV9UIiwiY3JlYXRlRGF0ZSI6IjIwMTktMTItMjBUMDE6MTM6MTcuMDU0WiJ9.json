A few plot holes that were unfixable from TLJ and moments that will confuse most average movie goers. There were also some glazed over new canon inserted that will stir up the toxic fanbase, but overall very satisfying for a lifelong Star Wars fan. 8/10","displayName":"Lee T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/607004743/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T01:00:50.589Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T01:00:58.990Z","user":{"userId":"802480204","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lee T","accountLink":"/user/id/802480204"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Look, let's be honest. The Last Jedi ruined the story line. Really the actors should have walked out as soon as they read the script regarding Luke sucking milk off of that animal or the world's slowest space chase. So I blame them. This film does it's best to deal with how the Last Jedi left things. In all honestly, This film would have been better if they increased the running time so they didnt have to cram in Star Wars the last jedi wrap up which is basicly like a third of the film. Frankly, I think JJ did the best he could and it worked. Honestly I was hoping they would scrap the last jedi and just have Rey wake up like it was all a dream. We all love Stsr Wars and I m sure by the next one we will fell better and realize that all things considered. JJ once again pulled it off. Which he did, so go see it.","displayName":"Milton O","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10220391206432778/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T01:00:41.463Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T01:02:31.439Z","user":{"userId":"978442471","realm":"RT","displayName":"Milton O","accountLink":"/user/id/978442471"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"What a rotten way to end the saga.

Nostalgia seems to blind people to the hate that the PT and OT received, the Sequel Trilogy is receiving the same treatment as before. \n\nRoS is nothing groundbreaking, it is a bit faced paced and definitely would have been improved through some form of set up in TLJ, however, it gives you everything you want from a star wars movie and thats why it's good. \n\nIf anyone sits down to microanalyse this movie, it will be full of flaws and plotholes, but if you're after a movie that you can sit down and enjoy?
