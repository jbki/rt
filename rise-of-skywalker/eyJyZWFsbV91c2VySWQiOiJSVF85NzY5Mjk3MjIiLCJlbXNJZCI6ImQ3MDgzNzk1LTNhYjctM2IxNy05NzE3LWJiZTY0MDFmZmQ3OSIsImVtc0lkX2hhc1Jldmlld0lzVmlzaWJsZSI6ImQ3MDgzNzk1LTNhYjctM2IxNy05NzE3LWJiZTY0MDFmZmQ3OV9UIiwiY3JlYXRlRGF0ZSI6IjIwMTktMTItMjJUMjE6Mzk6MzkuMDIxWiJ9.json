Iâ€™m a fan of this entire trilogy and what they did with it, and this final installment makes the entire series worth it in the end.

See how Luke was treated for instance. \nSo for JJ to course correct like that and offer a loving action packed tribute brings closure to the saga. Sure it is not as mystical as the original story telling but its the best piece of entertainment I've seen in a long time.  Its\nVisually gorgeous and the characters are treated with the love ans respect they deserve.
