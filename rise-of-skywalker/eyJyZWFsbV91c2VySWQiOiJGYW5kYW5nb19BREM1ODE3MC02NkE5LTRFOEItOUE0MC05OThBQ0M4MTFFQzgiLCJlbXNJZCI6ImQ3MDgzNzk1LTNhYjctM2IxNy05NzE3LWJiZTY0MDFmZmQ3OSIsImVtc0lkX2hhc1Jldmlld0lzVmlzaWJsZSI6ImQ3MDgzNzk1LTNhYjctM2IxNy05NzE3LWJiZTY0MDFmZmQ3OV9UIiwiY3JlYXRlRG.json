Star Wars fans doubly so. Does it gloss over a lot of stuff from The Last Jedi? Yes. But if one thing is clear to me it is that critics aren't fans of the Star Wars universe, but just the movies. So many of the things complained about as being convoluted are actually in Star Wars lore. Star Wars has been more than just the movies since the credits rolled on Return of the Jedi. TROS embraces a number of these things in an engaging and entertaining way. Ignore the naysayers and decide for yourself.","displayName":"Mark P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T05:22:31.220Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T21:10:00.148Z","user":{"userId":"A28301A3-53BA-47D4-9495-CF2991191C7E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mark P","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Star Wars is great!
