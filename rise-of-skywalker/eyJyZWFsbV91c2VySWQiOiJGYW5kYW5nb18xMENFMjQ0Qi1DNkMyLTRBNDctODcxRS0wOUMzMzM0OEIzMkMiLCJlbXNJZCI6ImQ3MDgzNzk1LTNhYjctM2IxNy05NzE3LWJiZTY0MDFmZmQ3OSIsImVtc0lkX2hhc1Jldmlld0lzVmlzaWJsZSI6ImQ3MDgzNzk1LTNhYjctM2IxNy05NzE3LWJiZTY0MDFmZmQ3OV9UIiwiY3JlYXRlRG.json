It's my favorite of the Disney era film and the first time I NEW I loved one since 2015 a substantial amount from the getgo. There are some (for me) minor issues, but this is everything I want a saga Star Wars film to be. Snappy, funny dialogue. A huge sense of adventure. New lore. New planets. Old characters and new ones alike getting big moments. \"Twists.\" And fantastic visual effects. It made my heart and soul happy while entertaining the heck out of me. Will be seeing it many more times in theaters. Great job by J.J. Abrams.","displayName":"Seth M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001618703009/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:00:19.962Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:00:26.026Z","user":{"userId":"917076265","realm":"RT","displayName":"Seth M","accountLink":"/user/id/917076265"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good story.
