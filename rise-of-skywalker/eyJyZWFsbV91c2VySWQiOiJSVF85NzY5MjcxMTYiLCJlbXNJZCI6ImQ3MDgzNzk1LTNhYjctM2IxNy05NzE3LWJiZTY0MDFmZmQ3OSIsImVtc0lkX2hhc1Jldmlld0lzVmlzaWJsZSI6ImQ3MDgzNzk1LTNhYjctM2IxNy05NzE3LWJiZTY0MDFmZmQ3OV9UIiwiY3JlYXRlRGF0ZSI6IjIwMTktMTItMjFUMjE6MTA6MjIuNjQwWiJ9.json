The Force Awakens was a little too safe and I did't hate The Last Jedi, but it was definitely towards the bottom of my favorites list. That being said, I felt like episode 9 totally redeemed the Rey arc. \nI think the accusation of some retconning is justified if you consider Rian Johnson's commentary on decisions he made for The Last Jedi, but if you just take the films at face value The Rise of Skywalker delivers a conclusion to Johnson's choices in a way that feels true to the franchise.","displayName":"Jesse P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:09:00.111Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:09:00.111Z","user":{"userId":"978453425","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jesse P","accountLink":"/user/id/978453425"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great wrap up for a 40+ yr movie run!
