It does fix some of the terrible stuff that the last jedi did which is a fan service in that regard. However its not perfect since the movie feels rushed and the final battle is way too short and could have been better. Lightsabers battles are still a weakness as have been in this trilogy but theres an improvement on that area. Soudtrack and visual wise is amazing. Dont know why critics are rating it low but as a Star Wars fan who was disapointed with Ryan's movie I can say this movie did a really good job in fixing Luke Skywalker character. The acting stepped up and there was no unnecesary pointless sidequest such as the casino one on the last jedi, nor a forced \"social acceptance\" agenda aka Rose scenes and the forgettable purple haired general in this movie. I rate it as my 4th fav star wars movie after Epidsode 3-5 and 1 (Im a prequel fan)","displayName":"Andres A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3274259329257734/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:08:07.449Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:08:32.947Z","user":{"userId":"978470796","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andres A","accountLink":"/user/id/978470796"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was the ultimate conflict between food and evil.
