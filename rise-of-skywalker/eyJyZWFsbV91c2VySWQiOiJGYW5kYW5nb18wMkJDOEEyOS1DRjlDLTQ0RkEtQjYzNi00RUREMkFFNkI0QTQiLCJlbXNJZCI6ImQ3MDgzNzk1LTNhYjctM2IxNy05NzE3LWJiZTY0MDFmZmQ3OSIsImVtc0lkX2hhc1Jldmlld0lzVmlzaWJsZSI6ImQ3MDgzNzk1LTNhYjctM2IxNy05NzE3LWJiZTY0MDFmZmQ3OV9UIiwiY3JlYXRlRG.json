I'm not sure what fans are expecting, but it did its job. I feel like it could be an Oscar caliber film and picky fans would still slam it. Get over it. It offered great closure for true fans who see the optimism that JJ was trying to mimic as Lucas had.","displayName":"Jennifer H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10201434457014770/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T19:18:44.890Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T18:35:09.188Z","user":{"userId":"977677016","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jennifer H","accountLink":"/user/id/977677016"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I grew up with the original trilogy so keeping it simple and having some of the old school characters back made the ending of the Skywalker era satisfying.","displayName":"Clos P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T19:16:10.059Z","updateDate":"2020-01-04T00:25:16.806Z","user":{"userId":"B96F00D0-568C-4430-8544-26639E99FA5E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Clos P","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fun movie.

I like where he started in Ep 7 and I loved where he ended in Ep 9. If only HE was able to tell us what his vision was in the middle, we wouldn't have had to play this (chaotic) damage control that we got in the first half of this film. Overall, I appreciate the outcome and applaud JJ for doing everything he could with what was given back to him.","displayName":"Rob ","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157182839509912/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T19:02:59.209Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:36:53.843Z","user":{"userId":"978452242","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rob ","accountLink":"/user/id/978452242"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"just came home from seeing the worst star wars  movie EVER,\nwheres the story? there is none,\ni cannot belive this film, its not good at all ,\nthey kill off \"#%  to make it even more depressing.\nthey should have called this film\nTHE FALL OF SKYWALKER\nbecause thats what they did to the whole skywalker family","displayName":"Noel A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T19:02:27.883Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T16:18:44.025Z","user":{"userId":"977850711","realm":"RT","displayName":"Noel A","accountLink":"/user/id/977850711"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great end to a great series!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T18:52:01.975Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T18:52:01.975Z","user":{"userId":"260343512","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260343512"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good ending. entertaining","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T18:52:01.570Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T18:52:01.570Z","user":{"userId":"962053941","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/962053941"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
