While the hardcore and the \"critics\" may not like the \"easy answers\" and loose ends, most of us continue to enjoy the unparalleled effects and action and the timeless stories of the Star Wars universe.  I understand the massive task that JJ Abrams had in trying to tie the previous 8 movies together and provide all of the answers for a sprawling saga and, all things considered, he and his team managed this herculean task reasonably well. I am comfortable with the permanent additions to the character list as well and REALLY enjoyed the return of some of the greats!  The 3D was well executed technically but I felt it really offered minimal additional benefit.  Not sure it was worth the extra s.  Still a great movie - see it any way you can!","displayName":"Daniel M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T19:11:12.757Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T19:11:12.757Z","user":{"userId":"8d09be9e-051a-4cc4-ba6b-514b872926c3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Daniel M","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great ending to a great saga.","displayName":"Rich S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T19:10:30.858Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T13:25:20.327Z","user":{"userId":"30B12279-98A2-41CC-9091-547464D82598","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rich S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Entertaining but you could tell the story was shortened significantly","displayName":"Chris","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T19:09:47.268Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T19:09:47.268Z","user":{"userId":"99E54314-00F0-478F-8DDE-D8ED88ECC135","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chris","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I thought the story was good and the action was consistent.","displayName":"Bono","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T19:09:31.255Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T19:09:31.255Z","user":{"userId":"4d649d19-70fc-4393-85f3-d213a9103696","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bono","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The perfect ending to an incredible legacy!
