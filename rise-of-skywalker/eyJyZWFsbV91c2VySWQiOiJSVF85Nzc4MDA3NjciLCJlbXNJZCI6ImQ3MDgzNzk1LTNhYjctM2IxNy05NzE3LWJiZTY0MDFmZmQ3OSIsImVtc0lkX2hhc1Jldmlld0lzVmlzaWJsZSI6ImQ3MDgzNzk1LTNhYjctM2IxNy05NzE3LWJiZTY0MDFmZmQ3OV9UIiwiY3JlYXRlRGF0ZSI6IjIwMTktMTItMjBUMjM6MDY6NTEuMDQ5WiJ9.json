Die hard Star Wars who have seen all the movies, played all the games, and read most, if not all, of the books will see a lot of ideas and story telling devices that were removed from canon when Disney bought Lucasfilm. It is a fantastic story, told in a fantastic way.

A thrilling ride on a journey to conclude the saga. JJ Abrams saves the day and ties everything in from the previous 8 films (and spinoffs). This finale is honestly the best and most fitting end to the greatest Saga to ever be put on the big screen. Truly cinematically a masterpiece of perfection. Beyond exceeded my expectations when you have to critically think as an unbiased viewing audience about how to bring closure to a first in film history....... a Space Opera of rhyming & reasoning 3 trilogies, of 3 movies a piece, with 3 acts per production. Beginning to end, a legendary story of 27 must see chapters of the Story of Skywalker which teaches us to trust our feelings and understand there is more of a purpose than choosing just black or white/ right or wrong in life. Life is always but perspective and as a general rule these films have taught us three important lessons: the energy of the force is what binds us all and everything together, channeling the balance of that force is always the pathway to the greatest success when looking at the universe holistically from all angles, and to also pass on what you have learned to those that proceed us as they grow beyond our dreams to give us a New Progressive Hope! Bravo! May the Force Always be with you! Also will leave the viewers and critics with the best order to watch/re-watch the franchise in: The Original Story (0 Years before Battle of Yavin to 3 Years After Battle of Yavin) Focused on the Main Dictation on the importance of the Saga of the Skywalkerâ€™s: - [ ] Rogue One - [ ] A New Hope: (Episode IV) - [ ] The Empire Strikes Back (Episode V) The Prequel Story understanding the Character Arcs of the following: * Anakin Skywalker * Emperor Palpatine * Luke Skywalker * Princess Leia * Obi-Wan Kenobi * Yoda * Han Solo * Chewbacca * C-3PO & R2-D2 The Prequel Story (32 BBY - 3 BBY) - [ ] The Phantom Menace (Episode I) - [ ] Attack of the Clones (Episode II) - [ ] The Clone Wars (movie and tv series) - [ ] Revenge of the Sith (Episode III) - [ ] Solo - [ ] Untitled Obi Wan and Casian Andor Series (coming 2021-2022) - [ ] Rebels (tv series) The Sequel Story (4 ABY - 35 ABY): concluding the character arcs of the main characters and introducing a new generation of passing the torch to evolve and conclude the story: - [ ] Return of the Jedi (Episode VI) - [ ] The Mandalorian (tv series) - [ ] The Resistance (tv series) - [ ] The Force Awakens (Episode VII) - [ ] The Last Jedi (Episode VIII) - [ ] The Rise of Skywalker (Episode IX) My ranking of the Episode's: 1. The Rise of Skywalker (IX) 2. The Empire Strikes Back (V) 3. The Force Awakens (VII) 4. A New Hope (IV) T-5. The Last Jedi & Return of the Jedi 7. Attack of the Clones 8. Revenge of the Sith 9.

Substance was traded for spectacle, deflating most emotional resonance that has come to be expected in this trilogy of films. This film should be a lesson to all that audience members have a specific role in the creative process. That role, however, is not in the writer's room.","displayName":"M.C.
