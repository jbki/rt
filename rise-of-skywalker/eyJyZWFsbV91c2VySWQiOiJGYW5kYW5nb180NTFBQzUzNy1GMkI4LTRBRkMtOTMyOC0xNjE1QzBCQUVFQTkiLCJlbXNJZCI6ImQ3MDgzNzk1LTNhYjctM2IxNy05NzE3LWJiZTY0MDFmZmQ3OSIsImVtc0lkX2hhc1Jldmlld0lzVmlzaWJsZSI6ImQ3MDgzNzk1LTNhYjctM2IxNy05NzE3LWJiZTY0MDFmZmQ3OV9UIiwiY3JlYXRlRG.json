Entertaining from beginning to end. Well-acted, unexpectedly emotional, and filled with some satisfying plot twists. The special effects and sound were spectacular and cane with expected chills only Star Wars can provide. Let the Force in and go see this film. I honestly do not understand the hate this film is getting. I saw the original many years ago when I was 5 and was filled with awe and wonder then. I feel the same after this one and I plan to see it again.","displayName":"Brian","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:59:29.075Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:59:29.075Z","user":{"userId":"2CFD8230-249E-4B6E-9C92-8D9DD0250FF1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Brian","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"There are a few slow parts that seem unnecessary to tell the story and a few scenes that seem rushed.

Or if you're a Star Wars fan in general. Highly recommended. The amount of emotion that overwhelms you, the ambience, the story arc, plot twists and explanations are all finished in the closing out of the 3rd trilogy. Hats off to J. J.

I did not hate The Last Jedi,  I just think Abrams set up a potential amazing Episode 8 and Johnson flubbed it.  Having said that, Rise of Skywalker was very satisfying.  I wish there was more of a climactic fight scene with Emperor Palpatine and Rey.  No spoilers here so I wont go into detail.  The movie moved fast and had a lot of action.  Movie score was amazing.  I understand that Abrams cut a really good scene involving Darth Vader's Force Wraith... Lets hope they include it in the Blue Ray!","displayName":"Nicholas J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:57:54.997Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:58:00.089Z","user":{"userId":"977304815","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nicholas J","accountLink":"/user/id/977304815"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Critics are just too critical. I know it's their job and all, but let's think about something: this is a movie. It is a fictional piece of film made for entertainment. I was thoroughly entertained. Do I think it's the best movie ever? No. Do I think it was a very satisfying end to the Star Wars saga? Absolutely. If you're a Star Wars fan, my recommendation would be to turn off your film-critic eyes, and just go along for the ride. It was fun, frantic, and cool.... if you let it be. When you enter the theater, you only take what you have with you.","displayName":"Paul","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:57:51.766Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:57:51.766Z","user":{"userId":"c9079a60-b7ee-4514-bcc3-7edb8f05b8e8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Paul","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Fun but really rushed.
