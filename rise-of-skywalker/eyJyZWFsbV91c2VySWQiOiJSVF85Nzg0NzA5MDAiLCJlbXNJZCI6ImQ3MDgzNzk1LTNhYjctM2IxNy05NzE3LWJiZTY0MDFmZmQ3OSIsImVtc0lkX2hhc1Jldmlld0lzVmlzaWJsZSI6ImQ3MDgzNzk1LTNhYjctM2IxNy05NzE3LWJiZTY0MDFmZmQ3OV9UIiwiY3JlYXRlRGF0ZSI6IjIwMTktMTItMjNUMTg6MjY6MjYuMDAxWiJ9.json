I felt that this was a great culmination of all of these characters that we've come to know and love. I think if you grew up with Star Wars and expected the franchise to mature with you that could have led to your disappointment. Star Wars has always been family friendly, and even a little corny. A Best Picture nominee it's not, and if your expectations were that it should be going in, then you did yourself a disservice.","displayName":"Shawn C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:26:17.346Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:26:26.354Z","user":{"userId":"978470761","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shawn C","accountLink":"/user/id/978470761"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"a big shit\ninconsistent\nno revolving books\nthey ride in space ... what a f.ck?","displayName":"Attila Istvan K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:26:16.048Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:26:16.048Z","user":{"userId":"978470893","realm":"RT","displayName":"Attila Istvan K","accountLink":"/user/id/978470893"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Without spoilers, the ending left zero hope. \n\nSpoilers:\n\nPalpatine literally won. The writing was trash and the the movie was so fast paced and skipped around so much there was hardly room to breathe. It's all action and barely any character development. As a lifetime lover of all things Star Wars, this was so incredibly disappointing. The Skywalkers all struggled and sacrificed and were abused just to be defeated by Palpatine. The saga is pointless.","displayName":"Katrine H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10206375012844428/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:26:09.069Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:26:15.766Z","user":{"userId":"978470904","realm":"RT","displayName":"Katrine H","accountLink":"/user/id/978470904"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Incredible ending to the 9 Star Wars trilogy.","displayName":"Tom B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:25:35.567Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:25:35.567Z","user":{"userId":"9431837A-093B-463D-9061-A0CECC160B59","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tom B","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I think this film not bad, not great.
