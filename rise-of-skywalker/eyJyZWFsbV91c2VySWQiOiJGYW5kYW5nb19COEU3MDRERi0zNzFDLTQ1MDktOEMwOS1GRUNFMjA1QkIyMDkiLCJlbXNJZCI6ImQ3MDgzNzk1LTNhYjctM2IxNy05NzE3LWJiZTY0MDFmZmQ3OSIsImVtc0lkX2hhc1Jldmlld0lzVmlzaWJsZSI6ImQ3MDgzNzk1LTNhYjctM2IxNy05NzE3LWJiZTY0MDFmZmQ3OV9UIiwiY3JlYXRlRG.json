It would have been made better if continuity elements from the first film weren't haphazardly discarded in TLJ.  Ignoring the \"fast forwarding\" of the plot between TLJ and TROS, it was incredible.  The biggest problem with this movie is that it makes TLJ seem like a minor side film, not a piece of the main trilogy.","displayName":"Michael V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/687253066/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T22:07:32.594Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T22:08:09.325Z","user":{"userId":"865185633","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael V","accountLink":"/user/id/865185633"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"}]}
