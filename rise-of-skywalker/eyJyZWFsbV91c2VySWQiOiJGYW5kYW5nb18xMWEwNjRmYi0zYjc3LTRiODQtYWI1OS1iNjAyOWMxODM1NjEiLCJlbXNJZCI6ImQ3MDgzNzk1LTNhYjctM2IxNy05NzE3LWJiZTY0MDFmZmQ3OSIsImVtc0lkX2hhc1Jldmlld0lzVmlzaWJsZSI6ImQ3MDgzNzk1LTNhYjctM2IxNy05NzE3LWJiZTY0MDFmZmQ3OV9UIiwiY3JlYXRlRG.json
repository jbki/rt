It is a huge, masterful, breathless finale full of heart, tying together so much so well and still providing surprises. The only way JJ Abrams could have done better would have been to provide more background on Palpatine's resurrection. MINOR SPOILER!!! Darth Plagueis magic is hinted at, but that's it.","displayName":"Nik","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:21:29.927Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:21:29.927Z","user":{"userId":"5b810462-249e-4508-af3f-4c10f938dd4c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Nik","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great movie with an awesome ending!","displayName":"Blanca","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:21:08.108Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:21:08.108Z","user":{"userId":"8b1c608a-35a6-437c-817b-c55343a4e907","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Blanca","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Worst crawl, for the second best SW film, and 3rd best lightsaber fight ever.","displayName":"Andy H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2517435645142218/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:20:39.447Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:20:43.394Z","user":{"userId":"978470884","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andy H","accountLink":"/user/id/978470884"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie lacks the heart and soul of every other Star Wars film. JJ Abrams basically must have thought, \"what do these idiots think they want?\" And then made that movie, instead of having an original idea. This movie hurt my feelings as a Star Wars fan. They created lore in the universe to service just this one film and made several other characters completely irrelevant in the grand scheme of things to tie up loose ends. The pacing is poor, as is the editing and cinematography, and the writing for both the dialogue and plot is incoherent. If you really need to scratch a Star Wars itch, stay at home and watch The Mandalorian.","displayName":"Nickolas","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:20:04.194Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:20:04.194Z","user":{"userId":"078c3299-b34a-4772-80e4-04f8e573083e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Nickolas","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I personally loved this movie.
