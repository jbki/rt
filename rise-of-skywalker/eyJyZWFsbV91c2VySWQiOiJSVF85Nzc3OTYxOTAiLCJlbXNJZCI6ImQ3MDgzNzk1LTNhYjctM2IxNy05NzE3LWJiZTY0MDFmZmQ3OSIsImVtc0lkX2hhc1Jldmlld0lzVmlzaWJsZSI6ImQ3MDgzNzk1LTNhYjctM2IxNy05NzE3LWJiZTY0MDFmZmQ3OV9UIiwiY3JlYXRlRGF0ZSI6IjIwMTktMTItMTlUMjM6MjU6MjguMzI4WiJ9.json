When we entered the movie theater, many of us believed that the movie was something predictable and we were definitely wrong, we were very surprised. Although the death of Leia Organa was imminent, we were given a farewell at the height of a Princess, General and Jedi Master.\nListening to the voices of the former masters and members of the Jedi council that we met in the first episodes of this fantastic saga filled us with hope, gave us strength, taught us that there is more to come and that your universe is infinite and full of probabilities.\nI liked the appearance of Luke Skywalker, I liked what they did with Ben Solo and his counterpart Kylo Ren, I liked the end of Rey and the conclusion of the saga that teaches us that although we will have to wait a while, this story is not over .\nSomething that I applaud a lot are the quality of the work behind the CGI, definitely the strong point of the movie is the impressive special effects.","displayName":"Juan C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:25:14.651Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:25:31.611Z","user":{"userId":"977866594","realm":"RT","displayName":"Juan C","accountLink":"/user/id/977866594"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"The plot's premise is ridiculous, but the goal wasn't to make a good story. This film is fan service. It's Disney and Abrams courting the fans who didn't like Episode 8. The narration takes a page from Game Of Thrones book. There are gaps or explanations missing, but the film must finish in 2h20 so, let's move on and people can make something up for themselves. Also, if something sound stupid or unconvincing, make it look cool. The lightsaber fights are great. The sky battle are nice. It's a good entertainment product. Not a good film.","displayName":"Jeannot N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:24:50.928Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:24:50.928Z","user":{"userId":"978442104","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeannot N","accountLink":"/user/id/978442104"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Worst thing about this movie it is lack of Star Wars core. There are some moments of real continuity with old movies/comics/books but after you took it apart its mix of Dark Horses SW: Dark Empire, bunch  of stuff from Thrawn Trilogy, some things from Clone Wars Animated Series, New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. Problem is: parts are glued without respect to old canon, without understanding of Star Wars spirit, or even phisics they created before. Jumping into hyperspace INSIDE atmosphere? Sure. Crashlanding of chunk of Death Star into the planet/moon without consequences? Even freaking throne were intact. Kids in elementary school know that it would be impossible, but its JarJarAbrams. He ruined Star Trek, now Star Wars, what franchise he will destroy next?\nBest character in film? General Hux. Now you know that trilogy is screwd.","displayName":"Lukas S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:24:34.708Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:24:37.336Z","user":{"userId":"978442022","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lukas S","accountLink":"/user/id/978442022"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The movie was better than expected and appreciate it not going back on the last Jedi too much.","displayName":"Dustin H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1674235656156399/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:24:30.153Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:24:44.516Z","user":{"userId":"975515807","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dustin H","accountLink":"/user/id/975515807"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Acting was actually okay.

Disney seems to have no clue (at least the people they put in charge after purchasing Lucasflim) has no clue what Star Wars is really about.  They destroy the beloved (and most like most iconic characters), they disrespect the lore and invent new BS that was neither part nor suggested in the old cannon.  In doing so they tarnish and disparage the the original films.  This is truly a sad day for true Star Wars fans... The Last Jedi killed Star Wars, this movie covers it with the dirt.","displayName":"Jeff A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/588467338/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:23:41.072Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:23:43.764Z","user":{"userId":"868801639","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeff A","accountLink":"/user/id/868801639"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"To pull off what it was trying to this movie should have been 3+ hours. The story is rushed and super shallow, the characters remain one dimensional with minimal development.\n\nThe one fitting thing is the ending with Rey alone watching the binary sunset. That's how it should be since every other character in the trilogy was sacced, sometimes literally in order to push her to the spotlight.","displayName":"Konstantine M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10221601103163556/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:22:50.434Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:23:08.368Z","user":{"userId":"978442105","realm":"RT","displayName":"Konstantine M","accountLink":"/user/id/978442105"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Remember those people who tried to crowdfund a shitty fanwank-filled remake of The Last Jedi?
