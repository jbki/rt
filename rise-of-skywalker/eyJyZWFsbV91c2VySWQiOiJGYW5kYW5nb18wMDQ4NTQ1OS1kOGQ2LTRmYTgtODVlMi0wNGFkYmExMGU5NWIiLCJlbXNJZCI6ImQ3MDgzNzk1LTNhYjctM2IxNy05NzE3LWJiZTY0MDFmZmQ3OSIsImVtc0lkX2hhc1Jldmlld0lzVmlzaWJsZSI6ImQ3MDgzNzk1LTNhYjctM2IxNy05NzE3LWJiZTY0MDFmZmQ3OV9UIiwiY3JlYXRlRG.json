The reveals had no impact, the pacing was horrible, and the characters just felt like they had lost their personalities. Rey is a Mary Sue and gets no repercussions for her dangerous actions. I understood what was happening, but it was hard to keep up with. That whole concept where Rey and Kylo were attached and able to see each other was also very confusing. I just wouldn't recommend this movie, period. If you're a Star Wars fan, I understand why you would want to see this, but if you're a regular person who's only seen the recent films, save yourself some money.","displayName":"Tori T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T16:12:25.764Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T16:12:30.745Z","user":{"userId":"976541829","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tori T","accountLink":"/user/id/976541829"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A great movie with lots of ups and downs, concludes a decades old saga beautifully...

Rey is an extremely compelling character and the actress is just incredible. The dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren is extremely moving and jarring at the same time. The emperor is the greatest villain of the entire nine movie saga and to bring him back was just pure delight. One critique I would give the movie would be in the final space battle. It just seemed extremely confusing and we didn't see much of the capital ships engaging with each other even though there seem to be hundreds of them. I thought this film was the best of this final trilogy. Well done!","displayName":"Manny C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/593161799/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T16:11:32.623Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T16:11:37.267Z","user":{"userId":"909685964","realm":"RT","displayName":"Manny C","accountLink":"/user/id/909685964"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"It was ok but some very questionable Force abilities which made the Force Users like Supermen/Women made all the other characters redundant. Mixed with some plot points that if you take a moment to think about can then realize some of the events didn't need to happen and were not going to influence the outcome.
