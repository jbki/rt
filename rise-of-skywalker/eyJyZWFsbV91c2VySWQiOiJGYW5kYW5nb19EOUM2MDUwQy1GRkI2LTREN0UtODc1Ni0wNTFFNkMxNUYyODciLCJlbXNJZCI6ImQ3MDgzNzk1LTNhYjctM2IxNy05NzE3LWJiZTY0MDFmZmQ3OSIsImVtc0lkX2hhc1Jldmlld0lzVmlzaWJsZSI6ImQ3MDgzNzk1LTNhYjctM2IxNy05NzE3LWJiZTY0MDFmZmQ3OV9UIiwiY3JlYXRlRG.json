I am a big Star Wars fan and grew up with the Original Trilogy. Nothing will ever be as good as those, but I still enjoyed Force Awakens and The Rise of Skywalker. Sure, this movie has minor issues, but nothing that took me out of the movie like The Last Jedi did for me. JJ Abrams did his best for what he had left to work with after Rian Johnson messed up the last movie. JJ listened to the fans.
