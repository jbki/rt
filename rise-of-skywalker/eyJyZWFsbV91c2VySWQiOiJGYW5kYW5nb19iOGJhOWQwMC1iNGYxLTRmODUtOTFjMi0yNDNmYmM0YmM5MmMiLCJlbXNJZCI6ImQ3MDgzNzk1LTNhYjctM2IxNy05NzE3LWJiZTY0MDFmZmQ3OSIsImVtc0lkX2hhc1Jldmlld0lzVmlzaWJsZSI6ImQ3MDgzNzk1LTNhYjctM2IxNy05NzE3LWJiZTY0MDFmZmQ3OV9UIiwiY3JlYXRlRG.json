The only good things I can say about it is that C3PO had some genuinely funny moments and there are some truly spectacular moments and set pieces. The unfortunate thing is that the talents of the actors were wasted on the awful writing which left plot holes large enough to fly a Death Star through. \nIn short, if you want a mindless action film this is fine. As a Starwars film, this is a sad end to what was once a modern epic.","displayName":"Trevor H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T21:47:09.364Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T21:47:11.913Z","user":{"userId":"978492971","realm":"RT","displayName":"Trevor H","accountLink":"/user/id/978492971"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This is the best film in this Saga Without a Doubt.

Sadly JJ Abrams and crew Skip that lesson  in university.\nThis is by far the worst conclusion from any of Star Wars. Yes this trilogy is the worst and this film sank deeper in the oblivion any good memories fans had from the original films.","displayName":"Darius C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T21:45:40.365Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T21:45:52.248Z","user":{"userId":"977802450","realm":"RT","displayName":"Darius C","accountLink":"/user/id/977802450"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best film of the trilogy and one of the best of the entire series.","displayName":"Kristi S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10154419886976300/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T21:44:58.551Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T21:45:08.628Z","user":{"userId":"976219678","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kristi S","accountLink":"/user/id/976219678"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"No offense to critics but this is the best movie of the series.
