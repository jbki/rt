It is one of the best Star Wars movies, and it is definitely the best movie in the Sequel Trilogy. I laughed, I cried, and I enjoyed almost every moment of it. I have a few small gripes, mostly about the lack of explanation for Palpatine's return and this \"diad in the Force\" concept, but they are all small issues, especially when compared to all the things I love in this movie. Ignore the critics and the haters. Rise of Skywalker was amazing.","displayName":"Jonathan S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001137935134/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:52:00.842Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:52:05.653Z","user":{"userId":"976851409","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonathan S","accountLink":"/user/id/976851409"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"The same ole same ole since the end of ROTJ","displayName":"Facebook U","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:51:56.827Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:51:56.827Z","user":{"userId":"9d212222-ab81-4184-a600-833d666199bd","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Facebook U","accountLink":null},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"While it lacks the cinematic craftsmanship of TLJ but it's a non stop ride, fewer side plots and the nostalgia that fans who experienced the original trilogy in theatres wanted to see wrapping up the series.","displayName":"Benjamin B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157812112712378/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:51:46.622Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:51:55.754Z","user":{"userId":"978453087","realm":"RT","displayName":"Benjamin B","accountLink":"/user/id/978453087"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"If you don’t like it, a Sith must have influenced you.","displayName":"Madelen","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:51:45.862Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:51:45.862Z","user":{"userId":"35D94502-83C4-483F-A6B1-84783D015E47","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Madelen","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"EPIC.
