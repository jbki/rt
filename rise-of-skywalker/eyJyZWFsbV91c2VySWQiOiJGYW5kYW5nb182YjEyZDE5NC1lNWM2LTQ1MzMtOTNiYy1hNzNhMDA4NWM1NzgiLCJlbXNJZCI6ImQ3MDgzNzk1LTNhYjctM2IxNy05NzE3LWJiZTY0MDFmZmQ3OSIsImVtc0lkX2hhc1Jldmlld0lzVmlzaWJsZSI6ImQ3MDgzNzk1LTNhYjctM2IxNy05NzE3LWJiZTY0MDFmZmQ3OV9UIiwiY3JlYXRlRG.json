Absolutely fantastic and satisfying film - best out of the last 6 without a doubt. Watch and decide for yourself. It does everything it was supposed to, and flawlessly, With incredible visuals, keeping us on our seats but still managing to be the warm, smart, and endearing series we know. (Note this is my first review on this site in years, and I have high standards, but I felt with so many youtube/public commentators complaining about this perfectly decent cinema that I needed to try clear it up. It's awesome.)","displayName":"Lauren M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/440112533078390/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T07:41:13.157Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T07:41:59.922Z","user":{"userId":"977245276","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lauren M","accountLink":"/user/id/977245276"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Personally enjoyed it","displayName":"andrew smith","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T07:39:21.413Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T07:39:21.413Z","user":{"userId":"5425EE29-EA28-4EB1-96FB-38324B358454","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"andrew smith","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome finish!
