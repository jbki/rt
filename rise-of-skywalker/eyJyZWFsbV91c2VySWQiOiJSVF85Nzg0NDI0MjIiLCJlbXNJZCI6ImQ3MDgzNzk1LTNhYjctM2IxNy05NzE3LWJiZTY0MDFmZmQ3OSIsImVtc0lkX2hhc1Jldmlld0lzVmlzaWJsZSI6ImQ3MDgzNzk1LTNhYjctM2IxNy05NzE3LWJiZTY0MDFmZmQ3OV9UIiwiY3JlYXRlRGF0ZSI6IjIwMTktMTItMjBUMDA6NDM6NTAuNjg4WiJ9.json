It's not perfect but I don't think it's the worst Star Wars movie, put yourself in Abrams shoes and believe me he did what he could to rescue her from being an absolute failure.","displayName":"Christian d","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157983761137444/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:43:47.626Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:43:58.333Z","user":{"userId":"978442392","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christian d","accountLink":"/user/id/978442392"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Makes up for the mess that was The Last Jedi and puts an old, devout fan at ease...

However, fanservice does not require the resurrection of every conceivable character in a saga to tell a story. What we got was an entertaining but disjointed film with really corny dialogue, some truly bizarre tactics, some excellent special effects and a contrived ending. Sorry Disney. By tying this film and the rest of the trilogy to the Skywalker saga  which was wonderfully told in the Expanded Universe, you missed an opportunity to flesh out the stories of Rey and Kylo Ren. One thing that I noticed - Adam Driver really excelled in this movie. \nWas the movie great or even good? No.\nWas it fun? Absolutely.\nWas it a fitting end to a nine-part saga? Absolutely not.","displayName":"Sanjay B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002685101205/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:41:10.815Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:21:11.735Z","user":{"userId":"927246425","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sanjay B","accountLink":"/user/id/927246425"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was not as bad as last jedi, the first half of the movie felt rushed and if this was like 2 movies it would have been a superb film, but due to time restraints some of the major plot points are blown past and only get fraction of screen time.
