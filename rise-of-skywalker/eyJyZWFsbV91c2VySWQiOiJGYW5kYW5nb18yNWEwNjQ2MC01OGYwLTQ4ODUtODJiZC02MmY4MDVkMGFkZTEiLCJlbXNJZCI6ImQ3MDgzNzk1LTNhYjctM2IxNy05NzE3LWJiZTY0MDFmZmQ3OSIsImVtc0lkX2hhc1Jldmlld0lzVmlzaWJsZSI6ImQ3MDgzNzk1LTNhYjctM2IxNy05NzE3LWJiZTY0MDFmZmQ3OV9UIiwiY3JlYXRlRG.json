As long as you don't pause for a second and try to ask the movie too many questions, or any question at all really, bits and pieces of the film are quite enjoyable for what they are. But nothing really makes sense. And the overall experience is a big, uninspired mess of a movie. The Force Awakens was pretty entertaining, and I absolutely loved The Last Jedi, but this one ended up being a thorough disappointment. I've lost pretty much any and all interest in the franchise, even though I do hope to regain it at some point.","displayName":"S B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T13:35:31.828Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T13:35:31.828Z","user":{"userId":"978496015","realm":"RT","displayName":"S B","accountLink":"/user/id/978496015"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"another fantastic movie by Lucas films!","displayName":"Wes","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T13:35:24.301Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T13:35:24.301Z","user":{"userId":"4B080EBB-D07F-4E32-91D0-B41612BB2A43","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Wes","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Plenty of action and imagination, minimal drama.","displayName":"Kent W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T13:33:56.705Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T13:33:56.705Z","user":{"userId":"f0e460b7-3caa-43f5-8172-8ef7903c727b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kent W","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Could of been broken up to 2 parts.","displayName":"Matthew F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T13:32:46.754Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T13:32:46.754Z","user":{"userId":"146C7963-3FF9-473F-891A-36185D048558","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Matthew F","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"absolute garbage.  dumb dumb dumb...","displayName":"Derik L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T13:25:23.634Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T13:25:23.634Z","user":{"userId":"B3F6C0E5-517C-4C66-BB08-D2EAEBD8083F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Derik L","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"An extremely enjoyable Star Wars film and serves as a (mainly) satisfying end to the Skywalker Saga.
