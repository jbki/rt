The pacing was too fast and the plot points at times made me feel like I was watching National Treasure. At one point I almost expected Nick Cage to pop up.\nThe sheer number of plot points also gave the impression that I was watching an entire trilogy mashed into one movie.\n\nAll in all this was not just the worst star wars movie I've seen but also one of the worst big budget movies I've seen","displayName":"Nikar L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/750631565422532/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T20:04:45.539Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T20:04:54.630Z","user":{"userId":"978453943","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nikar L","accountLink":"/user/id/978453943"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Too many unnecessary scenes","displayName":"Javier O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T20:04:27.982Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T20:04:27.982Z","user":{"userId":"D7432E24-D65C-4140-BAC2-4F6BF6C6D2FB","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Javier O","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Horrible writing and plot.
