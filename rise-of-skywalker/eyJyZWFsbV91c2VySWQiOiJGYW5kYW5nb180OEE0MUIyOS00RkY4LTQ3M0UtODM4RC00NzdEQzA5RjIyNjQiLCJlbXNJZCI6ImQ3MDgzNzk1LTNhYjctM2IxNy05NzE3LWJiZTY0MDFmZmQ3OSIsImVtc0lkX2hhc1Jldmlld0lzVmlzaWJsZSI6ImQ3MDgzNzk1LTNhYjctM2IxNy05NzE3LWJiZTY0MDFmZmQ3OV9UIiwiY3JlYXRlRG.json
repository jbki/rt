Didn't really like this one and it's on the lower end of star wars films. It's fun but there is nothing original about it. It takes no risks and tries to undo almost everything about the last jedi which I actually think was a positive step for the franchise.  3 stars is for Driver and Billy Dee who were great.","displayName":"Spencer D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T07:46:21.160Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T04:21:38.985Z","user":{"userId":"978103857","realm":"RT","displayName":"Spencer D","accountLink":"/user/id/978103857"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Star Wars died during TLJ.
