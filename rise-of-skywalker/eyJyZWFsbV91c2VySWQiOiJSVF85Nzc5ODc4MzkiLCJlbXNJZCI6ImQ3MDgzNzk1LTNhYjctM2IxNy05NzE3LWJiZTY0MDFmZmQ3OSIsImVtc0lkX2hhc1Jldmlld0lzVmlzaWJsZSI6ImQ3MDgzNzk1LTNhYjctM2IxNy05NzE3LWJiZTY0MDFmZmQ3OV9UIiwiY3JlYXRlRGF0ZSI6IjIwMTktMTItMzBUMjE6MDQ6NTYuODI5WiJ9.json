The Last Jedi was still a great film but felt me feeling abit empty. Having watch the Rise of Skywalker twice, I can say for sure I loved this movie so much.

I'm a massive Star Wars fan (might make me a little biased). I was really excited for this.  It was visually stunning and very entertaining.  It successfully weaved elements from its predecessors into it while creating even more story.  If you aren't a Star Wars fan, you might not understand it it, but if you are... you'll love it.

It doesn't have much of a coherent story, characters come and go very quickly, it has some call-backs to the original trilogy (of course) that seem forced, it's main character isn't allowed to have their own character in the end as we loop back to the world of Skywalker. Reading this makes me think of Einstein's definition of insanity - we were all crazy to think this would end any other way after the treatment R Johnson's movie got from fans and the studio itself.","displayName":"David C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T20:59:04.390Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T20:59:12.766Z","user":{"userId":"976959474","realm":"RT","displayName":"David C","accountLink":"/user/id/976959474"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Had some problems but overall really good and best in the new trilogy for sure.","displayName":"Chad P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001977883624/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T20:58:51.139Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T20:59:03.484Z","user":{"userId":"930429874","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chad P","accountLink":"/user/id/930429874"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best Star Wars movie since the original trilogy.","displayName":"Vette Head","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T20:58:50.757Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T20:58:50.757Z","user":{"userId":"9bb28d6f-a0b1-4083-a5e6-b14d65274f08","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Vette Head","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Perfect ending to a great saga.","displayName":"Dustyn A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T20:58:50.189Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T20:58:50.189Z","user":{"userId":"440D50C6-E49E-48BF-88CB-2FA764F5B231","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dustyn A","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"}]}
