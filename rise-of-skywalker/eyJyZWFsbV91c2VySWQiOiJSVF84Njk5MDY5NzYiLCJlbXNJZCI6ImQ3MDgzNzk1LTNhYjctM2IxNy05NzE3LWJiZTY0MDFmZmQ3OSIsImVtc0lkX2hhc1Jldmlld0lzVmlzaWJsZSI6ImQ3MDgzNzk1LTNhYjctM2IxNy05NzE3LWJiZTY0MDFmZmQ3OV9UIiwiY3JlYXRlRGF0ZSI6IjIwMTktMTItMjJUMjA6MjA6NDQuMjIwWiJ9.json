The jokes hardly hit. One of the actual funny things is the little mechanic alien thing. All of the stupid leaks for the movies ended up being true and what wasn't there felt like it was Actually just taken out. #DoomcockWasRight. The movie has good elements but it relied heavily on nostalgia and ripping the return of the Jedi's especially the thrown scene where they try to corrupt Luke and fail. The new powers added in were stupid but not unforgivable. This movie was one big course correction for the previous director tossing out a script and it shows. As a trilogy this sucks as a stand alone film this movie was meh and I say that because they did use the nostalgia element well even though it was relied on too much. I went in hoping for a memorial or a good death for Carrie Fisher but instead got neither which was the biggest disappointment. I really did want to like this film and trilogy but it was one let down and missed opportunity after another. It was nice to see they finally tried to add several planets and different kinds of aliens in this film which felt more like Star Wars there. the plot relied heavily on coincidences though to move it along on the many side quests and it's main story. Nothing felt like they put much thought into this story other than just putting it out of it misery.","displayName":"Brian F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:18:55.107Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:19:59.204Z","user":{"userId":"977836959","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian F","accountLink":"/user/id/977836959"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"This script might be worse than indy4.
