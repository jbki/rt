The story makes no sense.  There is virtually no continuity from any previous Star Wars movie.  The beginning is so rushed as to leave you wondering what it is all about.

Half the movie was undoing Last Jedi - I'm glad the Skywalker saga is done. This was the weakest of the 3 last movies but Rian Johnson killed so many main characters off that there wasn't much for J.J.  to work with or for me to root for ... or care for to be honest.  Renting this movie is best option for watching.","displayName":"Steve N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10220706705675104/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T00:35:53.062Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T00:36:41.117Z","user":{"userId":"978497128","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steve N","accountLink":"/user/id/978497128"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Really good movie despite some of the negative reviews Ive heard!","displayName":"Gerald L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T00:35:27.842Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T00:35:27.842Z","user":{"userId":"c2a11276-4585-428d-a60d-6eff16f7816f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Gerald L","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"I enjoyed Billy Dee Williams when he showed up.
