If you liked the prior movie, you probably won’t like this one as much and vice versa - or you could be like me and think both are pretty good. I will note, the movie doesn’t take too many chances and wipes away a lot of the new ideas/direction that the second entry in the new trilogy tried to bring about, which takes away some of the overall excitement.","displayName":"Malcom J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T16:40:27.281Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T16:40:27.281Z","user":{"userId":"B1E57A08-3C19-46D1-AC2D-4CDB736DF788","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Malcom J","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"It's not even JJ's fault... dude was written into a corner.
