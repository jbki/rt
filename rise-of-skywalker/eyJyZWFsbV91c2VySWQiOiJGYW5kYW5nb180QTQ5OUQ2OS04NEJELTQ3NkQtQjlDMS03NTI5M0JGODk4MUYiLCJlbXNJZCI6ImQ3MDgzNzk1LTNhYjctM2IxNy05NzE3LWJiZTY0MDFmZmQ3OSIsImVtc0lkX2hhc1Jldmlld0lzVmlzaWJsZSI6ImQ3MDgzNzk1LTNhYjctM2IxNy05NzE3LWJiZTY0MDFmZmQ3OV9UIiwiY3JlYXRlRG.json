There was never a still moment for any emotion to sink in before you were off frantically doing another thing to get the thing. The pacing was absolutely frantic and confused. The concept was clearly patched together to try and save the trilogy, but it had no chance because there's no slow build or consistent story arch over the 3 movies. I was an exhausting endeavor. Palpatine was cool, but they just needed someone to fight. And in the end, the whole device that protected Palpatine was thrown aside. No consistency what so ever.","displayName":"Paul D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157302085266132/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T06:14:12.963Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T02:08:51.170Z","user":{"userId":"977897519","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paul D","accountLink":"/user/id/977897519"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie was great.
