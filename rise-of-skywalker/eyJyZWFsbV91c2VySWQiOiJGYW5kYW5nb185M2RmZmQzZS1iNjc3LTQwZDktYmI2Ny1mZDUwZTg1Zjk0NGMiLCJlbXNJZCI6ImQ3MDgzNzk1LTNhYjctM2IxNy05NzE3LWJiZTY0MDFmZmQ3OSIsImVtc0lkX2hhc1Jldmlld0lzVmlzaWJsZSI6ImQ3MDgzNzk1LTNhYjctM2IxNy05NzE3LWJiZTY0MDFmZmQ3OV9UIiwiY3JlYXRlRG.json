The entire movie is a big plot hole, a lot of parts seem to be leading up to something which in the end don't lead to anything. The humor is not even remotely funny, and seems like they try way to hard to be funny in some scenes. There are no major consequences, every time something goes wrong it is immediately remedied. The fight scenes were God awful, terrible choreography. Would have been nice to see some other character development but that does not happen. If you want to enjoy the movie, throw all common sense and logic out the window because it doesn't have any, instead it is a convoluted mess with no payoff.","displayName":"Martin F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/679638859/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T10:12:33.329Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T10:12:47.147Z","user":{"userId":"878801223","realm":"RT","displayName":"Martin F","accountLink":"/user/id/878801223"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Good movie.
