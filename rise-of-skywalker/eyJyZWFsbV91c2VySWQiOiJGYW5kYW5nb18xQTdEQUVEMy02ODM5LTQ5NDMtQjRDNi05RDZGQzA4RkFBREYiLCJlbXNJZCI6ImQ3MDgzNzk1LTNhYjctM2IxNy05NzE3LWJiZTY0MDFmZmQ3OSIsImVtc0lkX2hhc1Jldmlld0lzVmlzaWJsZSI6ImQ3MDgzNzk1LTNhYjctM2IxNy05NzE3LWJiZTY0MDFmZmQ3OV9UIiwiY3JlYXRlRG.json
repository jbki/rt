Was much better than 8, but that's not hard to do. If you don't think about it too hard, you might actually consider it a decent flick. But that's really not enough to temp me.

To compensate, I give half star, although to be fair I would give a little more. Why? The story is not straight at all, it does not make much sense. From Leia's story, to Rey and his parents, it is all bullshit. And Palpatine's role and then Snoke, what a hell? Disney did a shit to Star wars, making it almost unwatchable.","displayName":"Fernando G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157009859942916/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-30T22:22:14.692Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T22:22:19.444Z","user":{"userId":"978345785","realm":"RT","displayName":"Fernando G","accountLink":"/user/id/978345785"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved EVERYTHING about the movie.
