I actually enjoyed the movie despite recognizing that it was also trying to cover all the bases. I heard someone review it as if it was on “prequel” level. No way, the prequels dragged, had horrible character development and used effects instead of plot. This movie still had you routing for its hero’s and even finding surprises as it unfolded. I would see it again.","displayName":"David J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:19:32.806Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:19:32.806Z","user":{"userId":"416E3C5D-F01E-49E4-BF53-3D43F9F83B3B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"David J","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Ehhh it wasn’t all that.

No spoilers here. DO NOT listen to the critics. They know nothing. \n\nSimply amazing.  This movie blew me away. It was everything I hoped it would be, and even what I didn't know I wanted. This movie came the closest to capturing the magic of the original trilogy for me. More than either of the other sequel trilogy movies, and more than the prequels. This one FEELS like Star Wars. I laughed. I cried. I felt like the little kid I remember, crying while leaving the theater in 1980 because Han Solo was frozen in carbonite. \n\nI'm sad it's over...but I'm so happy it ended like this. It was amazing. I can't wait to go see it again.","displayName":"Dewey C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:19:17.142Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:28:25.426Z","user":{"userId":"978452850","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dewey C","accountLink":"/user/id/978452850"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"plenty of action, and great closure to the story","displayName":"Justin L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:19:07.277Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:19:07.277Z","user":{"userId":"4F81793A-748C-4516-8CF8-702C2B4C8DFE","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Justin L","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"No spoilers, I thought Episode 9 was an excellent movie. I genuinely enjoyed every minute of it. I cannot understand all the negative reviews and people trashing Rise of Skywalker. To each their own but I thought it was the best in the trilogy and that it concluded the story as best it could be finished. Maybe one or two nitpick things about the ending I could complain about but it doesn’t detract from how enjoyable this film was.
