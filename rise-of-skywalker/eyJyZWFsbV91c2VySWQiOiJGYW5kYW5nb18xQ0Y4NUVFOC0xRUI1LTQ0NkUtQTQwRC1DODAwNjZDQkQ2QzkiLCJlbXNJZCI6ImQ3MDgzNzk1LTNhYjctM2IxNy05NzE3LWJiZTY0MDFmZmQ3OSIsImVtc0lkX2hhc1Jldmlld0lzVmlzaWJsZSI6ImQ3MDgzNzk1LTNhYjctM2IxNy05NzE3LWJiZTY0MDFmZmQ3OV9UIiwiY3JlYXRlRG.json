Just got out of the theater. It was great! I saw a complaint from someone else that it was \"tied up too neatly\" and I'd like to counter with, \"It's the end! You'd be pi$$ing and moaning if things weren't tied up and left you with a bunch of unanswered questions.  Hubs (who is a die hard fan) and I really enjoyed it.  I have one small \"meh\" thing about it, but it's honestly not even worth mentioning and is just a personal preference thing.  Just go see it and enjoy the wild ride.  We are already planning to go see it again after Christmas.","displayName":"Dawn H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2600787316637582/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:01:15.541Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:01:21.211Z","user":{"userId":"978453165","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dawn H","accountLink":"/user/id/978453165"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The best of the sequel trilogy.

The Rise of Skywalker is a strong stand alone movie let alone a movie bearing the weight of original Star Wars Lore.
