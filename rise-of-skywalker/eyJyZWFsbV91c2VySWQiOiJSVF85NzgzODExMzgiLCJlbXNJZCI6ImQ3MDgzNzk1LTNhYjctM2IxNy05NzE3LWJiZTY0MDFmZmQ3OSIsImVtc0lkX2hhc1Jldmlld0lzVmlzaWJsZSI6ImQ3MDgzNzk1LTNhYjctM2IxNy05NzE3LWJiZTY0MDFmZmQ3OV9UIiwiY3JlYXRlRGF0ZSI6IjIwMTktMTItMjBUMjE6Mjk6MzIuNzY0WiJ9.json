I don't second guess anything about the movie. It tied up old storylines and even opened new ones! So glad we got to see Lando in action again too! It kept me on the edge of my seat, and even got me teary eyed. Thank you JJ and Rian Johnson for bringing us this wonderful trilogy to conclude this saga!
