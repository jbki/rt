I ignored all the trailers and went into the premier with low expectations and was really taken away. Beautiful scenes and some great twists they definitely learnt from some of the mistakes from TLJ.

I also liked what they did with  Palpatine and Rey but it fell short in to many aspects that a Star Wars movie usually excels at.

It wasn’t shit but it wasn’t what I’d hoped for in the grand finale of one of the best franchises ever.","displayName":"Justin","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-30T22:52:49.206Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T22:52:49.206Z","user":{"userId":"85B5606E-1D62-4CFA-AB48-84D5F794C9CD","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Justin","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fun and exciting. a little predictable but still very enjoyable.","displayName":"Richard W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T22:52:33.770Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T22:52:33.770Z","user":{"userId":"1D71DFE8-0647-4130-9BBC-3DC7AEA3F3EE","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Richard W","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I absolutely loved it.","displayName":"Bex C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157876512067748/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T22:52:20.874Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T22:52:28.261Z","user":{"userId":"978493126","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bex C","accountLink":"/user/id/978493126"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Real good final Skywalker movie with lots of action and explanations with who is related to who, like Kylo Ren.","displayName":"Roger A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T22:48:22.965Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T22:48:22.965Z","user":{"userId":"63d78bcb-dc2a-4a82-87e5-81e5bf37c44c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Roger A","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"thanks for fixing Star wars JJ.","displayName":"tacoturtle","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T22:48:11.479Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T22:48:11.479Z","user":{"userId":"E394A3BC-A735-4D6A-9562-899CF2DE0E65","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"tacoturtle","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best one yet!
