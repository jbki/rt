But hell, was I wrong. J. J. Abrams found the cure for cancer, that was brought upon Star Wars by Rian Johnson, and I'm damn glad he directed this piece. I can't say it was flawless, but it definitely made me cry of joy, and not of sorrow. J. J., if you're even gonna read this, Thank you for this piece of art. It was a nice conclusion of a broken saga and may the Force be with you, always. :)","displayName":"Michal P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2957348914277483/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:16:35.040Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:16:52.823Z","user":{"userId":"978453283","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michal P","accountLink":"/user/id/978453283"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The evil is fun, scary, and dangerous feeling making me root for the characters. I just wish there was more depth to the characters given that every generation of jedi live in Rey now. I wanted to feel what was at stake emotionally for her.
