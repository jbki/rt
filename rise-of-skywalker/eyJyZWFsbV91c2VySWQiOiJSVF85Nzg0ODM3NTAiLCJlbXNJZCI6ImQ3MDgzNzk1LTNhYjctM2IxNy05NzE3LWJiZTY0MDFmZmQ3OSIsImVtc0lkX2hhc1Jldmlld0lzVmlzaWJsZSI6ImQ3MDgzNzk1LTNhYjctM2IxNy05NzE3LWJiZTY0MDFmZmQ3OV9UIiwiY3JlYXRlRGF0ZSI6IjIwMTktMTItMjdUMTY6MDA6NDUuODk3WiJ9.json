Rise of Skywalker walks back most of the sins of Last Jedi, while providing an emotional roller coaster, and a rollicking adventure across the galaxy. The movie also indirectly proves that professional critics hate everything; What they spent weeks trashing before premier night, got a standing ovation from the only people who matter in movies: The ticket-buying public.","displayName":"Jeremy A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001643573512/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:59:52.909Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T16:00:02.047Z","user":{"userId":"907581840","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeremy A","accountLink":"/user/id/907581840"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I went in having already accepted that Disney Star Wars, except Baby Yoda and Mandalorian, is hopelessly broken and they have already undone the whole original trilogy.  Everything they have done so far should never have happened.  But by having no hope for Disney Star Wars, I was actually able to enjoy this movie.  It's so illogical and contrived that it is stupid and broken.  Yet if you just don't care about that, it's actually quite fun and well executed in its contrivance.  If you don't care about it being a good Star Wars movie you can actually care about the characters and this movie by itself.  So I enjoyed it.  It's a bad movie.  It's a bad Star Wars movie.  But it's a good Disney Star Wars movie.  I agree with Red Letter Media.  They took straw and spun it into Aluminum.  I hadn't expected even that much so I was pleased.","displayName":"David M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:59:30.054Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:59:30.054Z","user":{"userId":"978483739","realm":"RT","displayName":"David M","accountLink":"/user/id/978483739"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"finally got the a positive ending!","displayName":"Eric G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:59:26.837Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:59:26.837Z","user":{"userId":"B5374677-1CFC-4304-AC6C-DF6A2B14C03E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Eric G","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Good movie!

The story was thin and predictable.  Some story lines were ignored and unfulfilled.  Lots of Easter Eggs for true StarWars junkies but seems like JJ Abrams just made a fanboy film rather then its own epic trilogy finale.  Clearly there will be further films, maybe we will get answers on Episode 21.","displayName":"Anthony S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:59:01.860Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:59:03.494Z","user":{"userId":"815352877","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anthony S","accountLink":"/user/id/815352877"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"This seemed like a desperate effort to entice a next generation of 'fans' and to sell more action figures,  Way too busy and convoluted, too many flashbacks, and the knock-off to Game of Thrones was apparent.","displayName":"Charles B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:57:02.059Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:57:02.059Z","user":{"userId":"6168c66e-4666-4114-bcee-b4c2149bc317","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Charles B","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie consisted of everything that a true Star Wars would want.
