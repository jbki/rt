Similarly to the Force Awakens the plot was not original. It was predictable if you saw Return of the Jedi. The callbacks to the original were not subtle nor artistic. As a long time Star Wars fan this was a major let down. The final battle between Rey and Palpatine should have been a fight that topped all previous duels since this is supposed to be the last movie of the Skywalker saga. Instead it was emotionless and lacked any excitement. This final battle had none of the heart that Luke vs Darth Vader had. Overall this was the weakest movie of the last trilogy. They canâ€™t end the Skywalker story this way.","displayName":"Maxwell V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:03:41.716Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T03:15:17.258Z","user":{"userId":"AF4A906E-B8CB-4323-BCD5-BFD78AF69526","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Maxwell V","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was a great conclusion to the newest trilogy, will definitely come to see it again.","displayName":"Ruben R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:02:43.582Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:02:43.582Z","user":{"userId":"640E38C5-4EDD-45D8-873B-E6A4F864DCD9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ruben R","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it, fun not stop action and left the theater feeling happy.

I have to admit they really tried. But as Star Wars says \"Do or Do not do , there is no try\". It failed to give characters deph and motivation other than \"Just be there\". Daisy was confused and utterly low. The repurposed Leia scenes made no sense ans was weird. Palpatine's appearance was also contradictory and shallow.
