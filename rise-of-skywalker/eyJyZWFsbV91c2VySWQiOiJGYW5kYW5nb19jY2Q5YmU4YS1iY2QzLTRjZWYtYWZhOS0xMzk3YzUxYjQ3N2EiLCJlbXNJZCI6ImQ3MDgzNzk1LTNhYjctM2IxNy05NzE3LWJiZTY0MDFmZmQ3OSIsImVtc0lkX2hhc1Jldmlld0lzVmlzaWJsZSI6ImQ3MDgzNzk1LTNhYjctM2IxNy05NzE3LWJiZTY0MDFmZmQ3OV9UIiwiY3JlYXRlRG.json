Yes, they were interesting, but there wasnt a lot of depth to the characters or any real powerful message in the storyline until Darth Vader died. That was probably my second best Star Wars movie.  \n\nThis one had for more meaning and depth (and good acting) than any of the others. Hands-down! Everything made sense with this one.  It gives a new meaning to the term hero.  The ending was fantastic! I cant stop thinking about it.\n\nSo run - dont walk - to see this one. You wont be sorry.","displayName":"Jill D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T14:08:22.858Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T14:08:22.858Z","user":{"userId":"099c7fbf-5105-4027-8919-d30266e8ffd1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jill D","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"This felt like a really Star Wars-y movie, but the story felt rushed and kind of out of nowhere.

We loved the movie, complete with those moments that make you go \"wow\", favorite characters, surprises, and of course, debate over things you would have done differently. To me, this movie was everything you want in Star Wars, I'm glad I spent my Christmas Eve with my boys watching it - and I hope they continue to invent new.
