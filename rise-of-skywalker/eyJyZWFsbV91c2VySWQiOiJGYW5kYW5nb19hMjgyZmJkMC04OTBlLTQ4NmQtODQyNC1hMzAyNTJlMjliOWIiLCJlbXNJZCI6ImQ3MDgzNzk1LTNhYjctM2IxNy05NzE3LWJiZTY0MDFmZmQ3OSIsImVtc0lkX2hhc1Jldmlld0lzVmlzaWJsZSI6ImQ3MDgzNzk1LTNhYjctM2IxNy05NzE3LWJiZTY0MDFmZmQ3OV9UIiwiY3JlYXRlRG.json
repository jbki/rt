However, too much was squeezed into one movie leaving many threads dangling unsatisfactorily. It felt like Abrams was trying too hard to appeal to those who were unsatisfied by The Last Jedi, and one doing so failed to pick up smoothly. Changes in movie style were far too abrupt, and characters that had been developed well were under- or mis-used.","displayName":"Karl M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T06:42:37.755Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T06:42:37.755Z","user":{"userId":"5C316532-7887-44AE-B41A-3092F6C2F217","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Karl M","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I am not a big starwars fan, but I really enjoyed the movie","displayName":"monica","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T06:40:17.156Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T06:40:17.156Z","user":{"userId":"1D811754-B6AF-4C39-B280-403C54C1F01B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"monica","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Fast and Furious: A Star Wars Story","displayName":"couch d","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T06:32:51.198Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T06:32:51.198Z","user":{"userId":"978493903","realm":"RT","displayName":"couch d","accountLink":"/user/id/978493903"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A little confusing but I really liked it!","displayName":"Suraiyah S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T06:32:40.307Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T06:32:46.112Z","user":{"userId":"978280880","realm":"RT","displayName":"Suraiyah S","accountLink":"/user/id/978280880"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"it was really enjoyable and fun to watch a great ending to the sequel trilogy","displayName":"Shaun R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T06:26:49.553Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T06:27:17.274Z","user":{"userId":"978493815","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shaun R","accountLink":"/user/id/978493815"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Felt too \"cheesy\".
