REALLY bad. It's also ironically one of the most enjoyable movies of the year. In the beginning you'll be scratching your head at the confusing or ridiculous  but things happening on the screen. Halfway through I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat just waiting for the next laugh out  loud or impossible thing to happen. (It's borderline endless!)

Now, JJ has come back, course-corrected to what he originally had planned for these core characters. I'm glad that my suspicions were right with Rey, Snoke, and above all Finn being force sensitive. However, its obvious the first half of the film was what Last Jedi was supposed to be, and the later half the final fight with Rey and Ben. \n\nThis needed either another movie or at 45 minutes more to explore more of what occurred post Last Jedi. But in all, I'm happy with the film. Cried in some sequences especially towards the middle half when everything is revealed to Rey and what occurs to Leia in the process of that revelation. \n\nGo watch it, don't let the Last Jedi shills tell you otherwise.","displayName":"U G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:06:18.476Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:26:56.122Z","user":{"userId":"906372891","realm":"RT","displayName":"U G","accountLink":"/user/id/906372891"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved everything about it.
