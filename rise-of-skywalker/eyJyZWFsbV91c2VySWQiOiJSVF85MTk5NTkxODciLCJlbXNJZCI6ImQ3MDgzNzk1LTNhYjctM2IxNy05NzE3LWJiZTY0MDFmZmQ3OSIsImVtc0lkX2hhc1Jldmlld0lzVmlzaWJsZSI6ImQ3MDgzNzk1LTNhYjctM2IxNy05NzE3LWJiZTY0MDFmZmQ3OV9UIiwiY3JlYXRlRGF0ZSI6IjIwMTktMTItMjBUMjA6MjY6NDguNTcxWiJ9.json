The movie may be enjoyable if you turn off your brain or if you just don't know anything about Star Wars. There was just too much in this movie; it should have been two movies. It looks like JJ was trying to correct things from The Last Jedi. Palpatine in the movie just made my head hurt. Rey has a ridiculous amount of power. I mean just ridiculous. And barely any actual Jedi training. The Force was used liberally as a way to a cheap plot device. The action scenes were mediocre. Especially that last space \"battle.\" There were characters in there you just don't care about. Last minute backstories which just wasted time. Unanswered questions from previous movies and questions introduced in this movie. Questionable character/relationship development. Sigh.\n\nDaisy Ridley did a great job. She's come a long way since Force Awakens. Adam Driver. Great of course. \n\nOverall, I think this is the worse movie from the sequel trilogy.","displayName":"William S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:26:38.829Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:26:51.961Z","user":{"userId":"786840651","realm":"RT","displayName":"William S","accountLink":"/user/id/786840651"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Clearly a reaction to the excrable TLJ, trying to cram three movie into one to make up for that mess. The movie zips around at lightspeed (pun intended) in typical JJ fashion to hide the fact that the 'story' is illogical and hollow, again in JJ fashion. At least he didn't have contempt for the franchise as Rian clearly did. Regardless, Lucasfilm should be ashamed for producing such a mess of a trilogy. Star Wars deserves better.","displayName":"R L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:26:25.014Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:26:35.430Z","user":{"userId":"810042043","realm":"RT","displayName":"R L","accountLink":"/user/id/810042043"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It was kinda boring and retconned things done in the previous film, every scene had a painful reminder that this was a Disney production and only so much could be done to save what the last Jedi started, of course the surprises in the movie were exciting but other than that the plot was kinda dumb and in no way do they explain some things so all you’re left to say to yourself is “oh okay I guess that’s what’s happening for no apparent reason other than because the film told me”","displayName":"Reggie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:26:03.905Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:26:03.905Z","user":{"userId":"3BA450D8-6E8D-4227-A9A8-7E827D0767BB","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Reggie","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Loved the storyline.
