Rey and Kylo Ren take center stage as the Resistance and the First Order prepare for war. Most of the favorites (and not so favorites) are back to bookend this last Skywalker episode. Some questions are answered, some not. Avoid spoilers at all costs. Not everyone will like this movie, but I thought it was a fast, fun, and emotional two and a half hour light speed jump across the galaxy. If you liked The Force Awakens, you'll probably like this one as well.","displayName":"DANIEL S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T19:48:50.937Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T19:48:50.937Z","user":{"userId":"50e3acd0-a5f4-40af-bb03-919867fbb9bc","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"DANIEL S","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"As many low points as high points.
