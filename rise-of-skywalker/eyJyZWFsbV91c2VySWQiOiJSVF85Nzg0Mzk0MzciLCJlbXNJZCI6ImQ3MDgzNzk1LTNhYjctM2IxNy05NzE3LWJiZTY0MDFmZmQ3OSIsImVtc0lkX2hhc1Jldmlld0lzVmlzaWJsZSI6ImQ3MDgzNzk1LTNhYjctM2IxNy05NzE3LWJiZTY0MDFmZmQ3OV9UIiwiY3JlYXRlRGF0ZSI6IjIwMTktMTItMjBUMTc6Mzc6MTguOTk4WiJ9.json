I loved this movie. It was emotionally draining and so fast paced that I had to sit there for a few minutes after to process what had just happened. But the pace and amount of things that happened is a good thing for me. More happened in 30 minutes of this movie than in most 2 hour films. Total redemption for me after being disappointed in the writing of TLJ. Looking back, the ending would not have been as satisfying without the choices that TLJ made so I already like that movie more for setting this one up. I think if you are a real star wars fan, and you want to see a fun, action packed, star wars movie, you will like this one. I'm tempted to give it 5 stars because I'm sure there are some trolls on here hating with their 1 star reviews, but it wasn't a perfect movie. But it was damn good and just about everything I wanted. My expectations were tempered by the last movie but this one shattered those expectations. John Williams score and it's importance to the movies can't be understated. I thought the acting by the main characters was above average and even great at times. Just ignore the haters and go see it.","displayName":"Seth W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:36:38.618Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:36:38.618Z","user":{"userId":"9d88e28a-3d10-41de-9f18-27f49a0feb77","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Seth W","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Horrible, horrible, horrible. This movie insulted my intelligence. And it shows as plain as day, so that all the Sequel Trilogy defenders can see it and not deny it any longer, that these movies aren't good and that Disney had no idea what they were doing. This trilogy rendered past films useless, and then rendered itself useless in its finale. It's been an utter train wreck. But do not despair. The Skywalker saga already had its rather beautiful and perfect ending. Way back in 1983.\n\nThank goodness for George Lucas and his 6 film saga.","displayName":"Alan M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/501658889/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:36:34.767Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:36:38.934Z","user":{"userId":"906964969","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alan M","accountLink":"/user/id/906964969"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
