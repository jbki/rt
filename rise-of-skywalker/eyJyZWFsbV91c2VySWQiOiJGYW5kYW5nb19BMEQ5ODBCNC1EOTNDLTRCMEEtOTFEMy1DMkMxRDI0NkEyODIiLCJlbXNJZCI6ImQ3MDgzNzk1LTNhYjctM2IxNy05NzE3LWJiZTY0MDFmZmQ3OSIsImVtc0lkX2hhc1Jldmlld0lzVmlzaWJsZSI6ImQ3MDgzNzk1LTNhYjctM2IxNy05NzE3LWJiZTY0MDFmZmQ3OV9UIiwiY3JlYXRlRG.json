The next trilogy while creative was dumb down for next generation but still had its purpose. The last trilogy is the head scratcher of why it even exist, retold same story, then made convoluted story in next only to do its darnest to undo what happen in next film.  Series didn't end with a bang but a whimper.","displayName":"bob s","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T18:42:33.130Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T18:42:40.943Z","user":{"userId":"907484992","realm":"RT","displayName":"bob s","accountLink":"/user/id/907484992"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Star Wars ever!","displayName":"Andy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T18:40:15.732Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T18:40:15.732Z","user":{"userId":"F7038B50-AC81-4DEC-9334-4D86AA583436","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Andy","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Too many action scenes close together, little hard to keep track of everything that was going on","displayName":"Troy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T18:39:32.750Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T18:39:32.750Z","user":{"userId":"e119154d-f9ef-4510-9765-dad993e0eda3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Troy","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good plot and quite exciting.
