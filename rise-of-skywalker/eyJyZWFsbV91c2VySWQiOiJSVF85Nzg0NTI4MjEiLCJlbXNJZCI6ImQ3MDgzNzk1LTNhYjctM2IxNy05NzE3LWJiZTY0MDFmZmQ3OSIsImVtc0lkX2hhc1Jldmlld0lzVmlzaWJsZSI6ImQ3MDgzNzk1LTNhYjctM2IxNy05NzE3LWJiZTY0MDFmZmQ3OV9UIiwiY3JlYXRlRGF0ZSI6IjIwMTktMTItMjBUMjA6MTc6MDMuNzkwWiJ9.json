The cast is just perfect, with awesome action sequences and some great shots. The Rise of Skywalker when it bets, bets HIGH and at the very end it pays very well.","displayName":"Luis E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10154123543905784/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:16:48.069Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:36:42.584Z","user":{"userId":"977289406","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luis E","accountLink":"/user/id/977289406"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Enjoyed this from beginning to end.

The ending was good but was hard to follow. The whole movie all adds up to thirty minutes. Till then its just small interesting things every thirty minutes. I personally thought it was better than the other two so that's why im giving it three point five stars. I was content watching it not blown away or did I have a grasp of nostalgia.","displayName":"Joshua T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10218398585974254/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:16:24.295Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:16:29.780Z","user":{"userId":"978452822","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joshua T","accountLink":"/user/id/978452822"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Disney has made me question my fandom.

The showtime was supposed to be 9:30,  it started at 10:05 ... subjected to nearly 55 minutes of over-modulated marketing.  As the movie progressed, just had this feeling was something was missing.  At times, the special effects felt like I was in star wars version of the Matrix.  The storyline felt worn & weary, I've seen this show before - although Daisy Ridley was good.  See it, but don't be surprised if you're underwhelmed and a little disappointed as the credits roll.","displayName":"Chuck","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:16:04.972Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:16:04.972Z","user":{"userId":"5255a0df-1ba5-4c3a-b3f6-886a90e48d0c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chuck","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I just finished watching the movie and I thought it was the perfect ending to the Skywalker saga!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:16:00.247Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:16:00.247Z","user":{"userId":"919212669","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/919212669"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
