I cried too! It's amazing. It's clear that JJ decided to give the fans everything they wanted, but that's okay cause everything that happened had a reason, it wasn't simply and unrealistically put there to make our dreams come true.

I felt like this movie paid off everything I was waiting for and I am pleased with it. It’s obviously a must see movie. I know it must have been difficult for JJ to tie up all the loose ends created in TLJ but I have to say I like how it all turned out and really enjoyed the ride. This was the best of the Disney Star Wars films. Don’t let anyone tell you that you shouldn’t enjoy all of the fan service and member berries in this movie.","displayName":"Chris","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:41:24.390Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:41:24.390Z","user":{"userId":"1963A64C-B0F3-438F-8274-0661D8789D18","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chris","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A deeply enjoyable Star Wars film, best of the most recent trilogy.

Power scaling is off in the last act. Some characters shown are completely useless. There's too much lore as if they put ideas into a hat and randomly chose what to go with. There are some nice or funny moments. Visually it is interesting. However there's so many things left out or clearly need novels to answer them for you which is bad story telling. Lastly the message is to not be afraid of who you are and the ending totally goes against it. JJ is right, he's not good with endings.","displayName":"Andrew M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1790862829/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:41:06.626Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:41:30.495Z","user":{"userId":"878123406","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew M","accountLink":"/user/id/878123406"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"There were a lot of emotional scenes saying goodbye to old friends, but in a way they all got the happy ending or redemption they needed.

The characters had good interaction and i felt that it was satisfying way to \"conclude\" a saga.  This film answered questions without dismissing previous storytelling, and really is a win for JJ Abrams.  Carrie Fisher was given a good sendoff, and i felt Luke had his redemption as well.  Good work to everyone involved.","displayName":"vern C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:41:00.696Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:41:11.057Z","user":{"userId":"971282972","realm":"RT","displayName":"vern C","accountLink":"/user/id/971282972"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
