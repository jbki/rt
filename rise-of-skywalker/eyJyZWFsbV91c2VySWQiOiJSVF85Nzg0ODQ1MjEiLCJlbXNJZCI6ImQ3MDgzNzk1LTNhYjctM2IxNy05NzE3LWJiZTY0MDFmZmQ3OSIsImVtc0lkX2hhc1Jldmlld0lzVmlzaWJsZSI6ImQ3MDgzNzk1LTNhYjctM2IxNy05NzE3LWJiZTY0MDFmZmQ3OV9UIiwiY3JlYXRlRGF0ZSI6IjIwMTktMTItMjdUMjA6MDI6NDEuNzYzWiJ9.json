It touched the heart strings with old and new characters, maybe a little cheesy at times, but Star Wars has always been a little cheesy. I liked the new things about the Sith and Force ghosts that were revealed. Thank goodness there wasnt another Death Star. The last battles and Kylos transformation were a bit rushed, but were overall satisfying.","displayName":"Sophie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T19:54:56.153Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T19:54:56.153Z","user":{"userId":"9c2f2b17-4c30-4e9d-8dca-d0ead96b9a47","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sophie","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"No es una buena película, es muy mala, una mezcla de ocurrencias y situaciones queriendo corregir el daño que causó el Episodio 8...
