It is mediocre at best. Not even fun and and empty video game husk of a story.  A+ special effects with B to D- story and editing. Every scene during the first half is frantic and well..boring..the action doesn't even have tension. Proof that Lucasfilm creates plot to go along with storyboards and not storyboards to implement plot. The powers and excuses along the way to the end have too many nonsensical things which render the whole franchise pointless right before you end up exactly where the Return of the Jedi left audiences in this latest installment of trying to reboot the original trilogy--except with more pretentiousness and creating HUGE plots holes to try to cover up the last group of HUGE plot holes in the Last Jedi.","displayName":"Michael G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/609777305/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:45:30.972Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:45:51.250Z","user":{"userId":"928077712","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael G","accountLink":"/user/id/928077712"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Please, do anything but go see this movie","displayName":"Matthew A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000174849735/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:45:22.001Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:45:26.051Z","user":{"userId":"901594661","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew A","accountLink":"/user/id/901594661"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Similar to other Star Wars movies of late, theyâ€™ve leaned quite a bit on recurring themes but I liked this one more more then number 8.","displayName":"Jack","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:45:20.465Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:45:20.465Z","user":{"userId":"14E101B9-7262-40D1-9B0A-EECB611F853B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jack","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Impressional, fantastic all the critics need to find a normal job!
