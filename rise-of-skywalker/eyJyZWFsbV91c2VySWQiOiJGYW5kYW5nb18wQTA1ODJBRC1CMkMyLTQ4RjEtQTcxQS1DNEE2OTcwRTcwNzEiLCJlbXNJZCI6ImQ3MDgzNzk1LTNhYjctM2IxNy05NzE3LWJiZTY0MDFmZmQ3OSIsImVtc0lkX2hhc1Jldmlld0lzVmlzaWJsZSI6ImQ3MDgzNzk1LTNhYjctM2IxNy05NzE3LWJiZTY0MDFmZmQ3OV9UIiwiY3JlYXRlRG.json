The characters development was severely lacking, they would just threw in one line of dialog to fill us in about a character's past, leaving more questions then answers and never diving in to it later so we would have a better understanding of said characters. There were so many WTF moments ( not good ), it felt like a Bad fan fiction film. Seriously I felt like I was watching a YouTube video, That the content creator was trying to pack as much a possible in a 2hr video with very little context, And don't get me started on the plot holes!","displayName":"Jaime W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1776831301/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:38:53.557Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:52:25.835Z","user":{"userId":"977856871","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jaime W","accountLink":"/user/id/977856871"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Definitely some holes in the plot but everything was top notch especially since J.J.
