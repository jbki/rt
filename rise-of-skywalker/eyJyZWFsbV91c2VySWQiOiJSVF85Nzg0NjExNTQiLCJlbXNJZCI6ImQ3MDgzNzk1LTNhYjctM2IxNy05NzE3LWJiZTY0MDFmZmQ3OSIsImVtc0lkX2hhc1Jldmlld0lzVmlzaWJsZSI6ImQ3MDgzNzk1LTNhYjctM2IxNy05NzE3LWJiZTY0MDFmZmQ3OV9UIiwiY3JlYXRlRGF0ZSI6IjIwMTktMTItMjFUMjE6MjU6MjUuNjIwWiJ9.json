But I felt overwhelmingly dissatisfied with this as the end of a trilogy of trilogies. Everything was done to be safe. Terrible pacing. No real sense of the stakes the events of the movie would have outside of the lives of the main characters is given. We were ultimately presented with the climax of Return of the Jedi again because apparently Star Wars is not allowed to be anything other than the original trilogy. If I was not a Star Wars fan, I would have probably rated this lower, but nearly any Star Wars content brings me back to the same good feelings I had as a child watching the originals.","displayName":"Alec W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:25:09.478Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:25:24.337Z","user":{"userId":"870080434","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alec W","accountLink":"/user/id/870080434"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A slow beginning, but strong ending.
