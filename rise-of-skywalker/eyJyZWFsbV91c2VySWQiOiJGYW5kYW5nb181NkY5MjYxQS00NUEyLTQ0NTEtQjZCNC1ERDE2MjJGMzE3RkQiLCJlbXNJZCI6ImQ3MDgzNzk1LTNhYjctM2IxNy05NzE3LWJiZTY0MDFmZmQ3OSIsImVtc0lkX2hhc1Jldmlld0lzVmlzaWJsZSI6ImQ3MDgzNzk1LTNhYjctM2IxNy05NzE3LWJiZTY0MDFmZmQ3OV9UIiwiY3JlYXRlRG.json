I like all of the Star Wars movies. Adding Leia in was choppy. But I think they did the best they could with her passing. The 40 minutes of previews was out of hand. The move was to start at 2:50.

For this reason i don't blame him too much. The only real criticism that I would like to make regards his obvious lack of creativity, already put on display in The Force Awakens. \n\nOf course throughout the movie but especially at the beginning the pacing is too tight. Everything happens super fast without giving the viewer the time to better absorb what is going on. There are many things that didn't work, many things that don't make sense and others that had to be done much better, still that's also a lot to like in this movie. I won't spoil anything. \n\nI didn't hate it, i think it's way more rewatchable than The Last Jedi, The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, but at the end the question i asked myself was: \"what was the point of this trilogy?\" \n\nRise of Skywalker is beautiful to watch, the special effects are good as well as the cinematography but it lacks any emotion thanks to what came before. This was a disjointed trilogy that didn't make the viewer care about the characters and what's happening. A huge opportunity lost by Lucas Film and Disney. That's why episode IX and the final chapter of the Skywalker saga it's only a 2,5 stars out of 5. Meh, it passed the time. Literally.","displayName":"Alberto M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:21:52.177Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:06:10.700Z","user":{"userId":"978480155","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alberto M","accountLink":"/user/id/978480155"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"}]}
