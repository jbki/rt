It truly isnt as bad as most reviews suggest, but it has glaring plot holes, awkward character placement, and some odd storylines that never saw fruition. Acting, cinematography, and score could not be more perfect. This film is lacking in its writing and simply just needed a more logical flow","displayName":"Dev V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T09:11:16.558Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T09:11:23.493Z","user":{"userId":"977608169","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dev V","accountLink":"/user/id/977608169"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A beautiful film!

Everything was comically convenient when there was a need or roadblock. Character arcs: what are those? And the Force can do exactly whatever the plot needs. I feel bad for JJ Abrams (sorta) for having to clean up the utter mess Rian Johnson left behind. At least it wasn't painfully dull and slow like the Prequels, but that ain't saying much. At least we can all finally put the series to rest and feel free to be disappointed with other Disney products now. That's a silver lining, right?","displayName":"Joel","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T08:49:59.535Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T08:49:59.535Z","user":{"userId":"b100c5c9-ae86-4afd-bb25-d5492e83730e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joel","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A good finish to a out of order sequel.","displayName":"Mark Waldecker","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T08:33:09.634Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T08:33:09.634Z","user":{"userId":"F9C4F1E6-948D-4E2A-A1F4-185B430F1759","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mark Waldecker","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Too many holes in the story, plot elements felt rushed, but special effects were awesome.
