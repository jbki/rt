Lots of action, good story a good conclusion tpo the series.  Happy to see Harrison Ford in his brief role.  Wonder how they got the footage of Carrie Fisher.  We saw the 3D version and I enjoyed it even though my right eye has a 20/400 I was able to see most of the effects.  3D has cpme a long way. I've been watching IV, V & VI at home since seeing this.  I will finish VII & VIII  soon on my 4K TV.","displayName":"James D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T14:59:51.630Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T14:59:51.630Z","user":{"userId":"0c70b84c-50ea-4045-a2c9-2a5a5cef42f3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"James D","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Such a good movie!

However, longtime fans will have a myriad of ways to pick it apart and make it a disappointment if they want.

Wanted more Lando scenes felt like a wasted character like Snoke and Phasma. The could have split this movie into Two movies to develop the story better. Disney should have kept Snoke as the bad guy instead of bringing back the emperor.
