The big bad was terribly written, taking out two \"Jedi\"  when he was in a weakened state but could not beat one half dead when he was at full power. Items were in a scene one moment gone the next and back again. Did no one set down and watch the movie before they released it to the public?  Star wars saga goes out with a whimper.","displayName":"Brian P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000929851902/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T21:51:08.547Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T21:51:23.378Z","user":{"userId":"933573258","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian P","accountLink":"/user/id/933573258"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Over the top force power","displayName":"Keiran U","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T21:50:55.515Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T21:50:55.515Z","user":{"userId":"468db45e-fb4c-4d47-8f0c-d4c4ca282217","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Keiran U","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I liked the movie and some of the scenes Had that larger than life Star Wars whomp. I have been harsh with the rating because I expect the world from Star Wars. Considerable efforts have gone into making sense of the happenings in The Last Jedi. With the entire Star Wars universe at their disposal, I felt frustrated that they restricted themselves to the plot of the original trilogy. The world building was great and there were some spectacular scenes. My biggest complaint of this trilogy is that the cast of the original trilogy was never given sufficient weight. That opportunity has now been lost for ever.","displayName":"Ankur C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/653633274/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T21:50:37.970Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T21:50:43.987Z","user":{"userId":"789006959","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ankur C","accountLink":"/user/id/789006959"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Rather painful 2.5 hours. JJ Abrahams pulled mediocrity from the jaws of greatness it's like he needed to repeat LOST all over again except with Star Wars. The entire story feels rushed, cutting from scene to scene as fast as possible to get to the culmination. There's so little explanation or backstory with entire plot and characters, especially at the pivotal plot twists. Extremely disappointed.","displayName":"Mr. V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T21:49:14.281Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T21:49:14.281Z","user":{"userId":"2F294AE3-09F9-48FB-92BF-1EAD61DE213C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mr. V","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Better then The Last Jedi !
