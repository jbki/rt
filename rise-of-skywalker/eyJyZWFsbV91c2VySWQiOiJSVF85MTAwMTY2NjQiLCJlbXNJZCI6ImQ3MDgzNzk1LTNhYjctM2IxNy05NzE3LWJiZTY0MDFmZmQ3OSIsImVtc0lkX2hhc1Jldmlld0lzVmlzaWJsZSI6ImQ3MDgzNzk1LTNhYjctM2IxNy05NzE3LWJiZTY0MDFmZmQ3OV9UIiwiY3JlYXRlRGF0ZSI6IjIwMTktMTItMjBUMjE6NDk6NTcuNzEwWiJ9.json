JJ did a great job redeeming the mess that was Last Jedi. As an OT fan who was there in the theater in 1977, and now was there for the first show in 2019, I found it to be a fantastic ending to the Skywalker saga. It's meant to be fun, not a hardcore drama film. Y'all just chill and enjoy the ride.","displayName":"Julie T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10201840827286680/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:49:35.714Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:49:42.301Z","user":{"userId":"978453560","realm":"RT","displayName":"Julie T","accountLink":"/user/id/978453560"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Hardly anything to dislike. Disney ruined Star Wars for me, but this last movie is one of my favorite films. So many mixed emotions throughout the plot. The new characters really made you feel the nostalgia of the old crew.

It was a little fast-paced in places but I think JJ Abrams did a great job after having to pick up after The Last Jedi, which I hated. The Leia parts were a little clunky but I think they did great with what they had to work with. \nStar Wars isn't high art to me. It's entertainment to be seen through the same 3rd-grade eyes I saw Episode IV with. I felt like a kid again seeing this and my 8-year-old loved every second of it, he could barely sit still, just like my dad said I was during Episode IV. The only thing that kept it from 5 stars for me was it could have actually used a little more fan service surrounding Rey during the end battle.","displayName":"Michael M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:49:09.685Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:49:23.952Z","user":{"userId":"970256565","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael M","accountLink":"/user/id/970256565"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
