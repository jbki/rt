There is some pacing issues and some plot points that get glossed over, but that is largely due to the fact that they had to do so much “apologizing” for the last movie. I’m very satisfied with how the trilogy ended and wish JJ would have had control of all 3 movies.","displayName":"Steven","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T18:39:58.505Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T18:39:58.505Z","user":{"userId":"7FB5D5E4-D809-42FD-966B-7E2088A2BC3E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Steven","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I heard so many bad things about this movie. I assumed I would hate it, like I hated The Last Jedi. JJ Abrams spends the first half trying to undo the disaster of the last movie and course correct leading to a few times where I laughed at how ludicrous the plot was. The Force Awakens copied the originals too closely. The Last Jedi disprected them. But this one built on them. Overall I enjoyed it and am quite satisfied. The best of this newest trilogy.","displayName":"Tundra L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T18:39:56.289Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T18:39:59.534Z","user":{"userId":"978230709","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tundra L","accountLink":"/user/id/978230709"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Rise of Skywalker brings it all together, as a Star Wars fan my whole life the references to all the other movies and hat tipping to tons of great characters made me very happy. A little campy sure but let’s face it JJ saved the debacle Johnson left him and another hat tip to the shots JJ took at the terrible decisions Johnson made. Simply put I Loved it and all Star Wars real fans should as well, as a movie on its own it’s action packed and has some great moments.
