All of those are true. But looking in the positive side of the movie, it is a JJ film so it looks great and the scenes are great. This film could’ve used a two part finale treatment, but is otherwise rushed. The gems in this movie are what the writers took from the lore of the SW realm that occurred before Phantom Menace and how it got wrapped up on the final 9th episode. That makes the Rey story line very consequential. If you aren’t aware of the Sith/Jedi lore in the “Old Republic” that takes place roughly 3,000 years before Phantom Menace then you should spend time researching it. The nuances and complexities of ancient Sith and Jedi beliefs are thrust into the forefront of the story telling, and it may appear as foreign and novel concepts. Realistically there is no way that Disney would have patience for a Terri part finale like LOTR, so we’re left with a rushed story line, a spectacle of a finale. And reluctantly I must agree that it did satisfy.","displayName":"Tony M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T14:28:31.875Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:12:30.473Z","user":{"userId":"429BD1C3-A5FD-4530-A525-C8B70400F81B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tony M","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Every Star Wars fan should watch this movie!!!","displayName":"Kenny H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T14:26:21.531Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T21:42:20.982Z","user":{"userId":"0E572271-DA11-492A-A4B8-BAE1A664258E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kenny H","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie tied the whole storyline of the Skywalker,s together and Rey’s heritage in which made this a great way to close out the Skywalker saga.","displayName":"Carl","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T14:25:42.154Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T20:31:59.973Z","user":{"userId":"EEEB3F04-231E-40BB-9F4D-BB005817A3CA","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Carl","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"}]}
