This one came close, for me.\n\nFrom the very first moment, I felt like I was watching a bunch of actors on stage. There is way too much exposition that is obvious. The writing is for the most part very predictable Star Wars. If you've seen a couple of the other movies, you'll probably be able to piece together the major events pretty well. Aside from a couple Jack-in-the-Box \"Oh I bet you weren't expecting that\" moments, there's nothing particularly surprising.\n\nI never felt any emotion for the characters on screen the entire time, even though I wanted to. It felt rushed, like JJ Abrams wanted to fit as much fan service in as possible, rather than actually telling a story. Oh, and that last movie? Yeah, forget anything that happened in it. If you want a giant \"F YOU\" to the last movie, I guess you'll like this?\n\nNo thanks.","displayName":"Elly G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T15:22:27.907Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T15:22:27.907Z","user":{"userId":"978480048","realm":"RT","displayName":"Elly G","accountLink":"/user/id/978480048"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It's okay, didn't totally suck.
