Disney has fired off their best production...ever. Yes, there are a few question marks, but these may lead into future works. The critics (as usual) are looking for something that isn't/shouldn't be there...which is just fine to us who know better. The acting is phenomenal, the music is legendary, the story is perfect, and the visuals are as good as it gets.
