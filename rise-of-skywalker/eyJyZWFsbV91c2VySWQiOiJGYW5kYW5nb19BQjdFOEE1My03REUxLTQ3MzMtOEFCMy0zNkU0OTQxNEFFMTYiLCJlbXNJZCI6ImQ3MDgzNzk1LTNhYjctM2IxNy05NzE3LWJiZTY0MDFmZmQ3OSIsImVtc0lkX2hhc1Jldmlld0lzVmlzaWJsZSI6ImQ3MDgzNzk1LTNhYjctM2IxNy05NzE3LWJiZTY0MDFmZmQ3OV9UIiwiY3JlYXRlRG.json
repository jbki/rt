I had concerns as soon as the film completed the segment of scrolling text in the classic star wars fashion.  Sadly nothing else about the film would fullfil the expectations I have for the Star Wars franchise.  Although I haven't been a huge fan of the latest three in the series it's only been down hill since the first film.  The trend does not change with Rise of the Skywalker.  Rogue One and Solo better captured the spirit and style of the Star Wars franchise despite not being part of the core series.  Only Star Wars movie where I walked out to use the restroom half way through and knew I wasn't missing anything.  Also found myself wondering when it would be over so I could watch the latest episode of the Mandalorian.  If you're like me you'll probably watch this movie anyways but that doesn't mean Disney deserves being rewarded for selling us a pile of nostalgic trash.","displayName":"Samuel D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/19719573/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T20:53:26.823Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T20:53:35.125Z","user":{"userId":"932902109","realm":"RT","displayName":"Samuel D","accountLink":"/user/id/932902109"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"At first I was going to give this movie a 3 out 5 stars but then I was like nah its not that good. Now I think Rise of Skywalker is better then all the critics are saying about it. I like it more then The Last Jedi (Which I gave 1 out 5 stars). This movie brings answers to the questions from the previous 2 movies but it gives you more answers that was never answered in this movie. I think this whole trilogy did not need to be made. Just give us a Old Republic Trilogy already. Like no one gives a crap about the characters in this new sequel trilogy. I find Rey being the emperors granddaughter is so dumb too. She should have been a skywalker. How Kylo Ren went out was dumb also. Now I might be saying all these bad things about this movie. However I enjoyed the movie for what it is a great entertainment for My friend and I. Some choices in the movie also didn't make any sense whatsoever. I will give this movie 2.5 out of 5 stars","displayName":"Tyler H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-30T20:53:06.892Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T20:53:18.125Z","user":{"userId":"977838733","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tyler H","accountLink":"/user/id/977838733"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"All over the map with the plot and there were so many holes in the story it was hard to pretend I was interested.
