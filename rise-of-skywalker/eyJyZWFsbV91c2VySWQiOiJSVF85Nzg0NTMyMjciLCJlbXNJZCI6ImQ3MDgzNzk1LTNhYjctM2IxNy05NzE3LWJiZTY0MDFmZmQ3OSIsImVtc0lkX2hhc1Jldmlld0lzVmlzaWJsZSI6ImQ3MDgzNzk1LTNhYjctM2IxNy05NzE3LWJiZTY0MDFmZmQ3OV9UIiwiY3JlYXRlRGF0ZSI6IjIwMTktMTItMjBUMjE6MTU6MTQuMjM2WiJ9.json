It very much healed the wounds caused by TLJ and is amazing in the fact that a major franchise so openly retconned a previous film because of fan disappointment. You can now essentially watch TFA and RoS and understand the sequels.\n\nIan McDiarmid also proves his absolute talent in acting. Palpatine was absolutely fantastic in this movie. His scenes were by far the highlight.\n\nWell done by JJ. Cater to fans, not critics.","displayName":"Brandon M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1460177356/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:15:05.713Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:16:02.865Z","user":{"userId":"917001364","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brandon M","accountLink":"/user/id/917001364"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Impossible task of trying to satisfy everyone and bring a close to a generational series, but I think JJ did a great job.

Highly entertaining and very pleasing to the eyes. It’s fun. It’s supposed to be fun. People are too serious. It was a good end to a saga that has had plenty of ups and downs. A top 4 movie in the Skywalker Saga. Just sit back and relax. Enjoy it.

JJ straight away copied OT elements and destroyed all creative things Rian brought into TLJ. Among things that made it so inferior to the first two sequel movies: ooc characters, their regression, cringy dialogue, no deapth, taking the title of the last Skywalker from Ben and giving it to Rey nothing feels earned, disrespectful treatment of Ben Solo.\nAbadnonment of idea of grey characters and redemption through actions, not death.","displayName":"Anastasia Z","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1761607100810106/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:14:51.388Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T14:43:07.213Z","user":{"userId":"978044164","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anastasia Z","accountLink":"/user/id/978044164"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved this film!
