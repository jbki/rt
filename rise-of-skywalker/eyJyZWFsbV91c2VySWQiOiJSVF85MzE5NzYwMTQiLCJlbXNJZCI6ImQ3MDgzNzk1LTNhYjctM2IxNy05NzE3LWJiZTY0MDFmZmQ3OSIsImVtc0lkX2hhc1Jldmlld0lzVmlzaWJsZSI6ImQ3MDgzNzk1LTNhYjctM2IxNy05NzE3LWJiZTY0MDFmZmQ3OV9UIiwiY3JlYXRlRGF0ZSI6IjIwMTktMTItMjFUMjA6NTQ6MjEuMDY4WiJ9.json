Um desfecho digno de Star Wars. Porém algumas soluções que o filme nos apresenta para partes da trama são muito \"faceis\" por assim dizer, além do medo que o filme tem em arriscar na história. Mas o filme é tão bonito e emocionante que esses erros \"passam\".

Disney/Lucasfilm took the most risk in this film. TFA was the first in the trilogy and they played it safe. TLJ being the second film left many fans including me disappointed. That being said TRoS was the third and final in the trilogy/series. Disney/LF did a lot of coarse correction in this film. They introduced a lot of new plot in the beginning but was still able to concluded the film in a way that left classic disney fans(Family-friendly/ all ages) satisfied and all Star Wars fans with enough Easter eggs and throwbacks to keep us happy. In the end I was impressed with the circumstances given what they were able to do.","displayName":"Tyler S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:53:38.859Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:53:38.859Z","user":{"userId":"f9359f6a-8c91-4cd8-a7e5-d2d4d0cd8af0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tyler S","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I tried to go in with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised at how fun and satisfying this movie was. Many reviews either completely panned or completely praised it, so I guess I was somewhat on the lookout for major missteps but really, it generally held up very well. I initially hated The Last Jedi, but on a recent rewatch decided to consciously jettison all of the online backlash and I actually enjoyed that more too (except for Canto Bight, that will always be awkward). I think the key is to not \"pre-vote\" before going in. If you think you will hate it then you will. If you go in thinking that this is a nice ending to this sequel trilogy with nothing particularly \"edgy\" happening in it, then you will be good to go. \nAlso it's worth remembering that Star Wars was originally a big budget ode to the Flash Gordon serials of yesteryear. This film adds to that legacy in that it plays out like 6 episodes of a serial strung together. It's jam-packed, no doubt about it, but if you can handle binging a TV show than this is no different.","displayName":"Ed C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10216176741192196/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:53:35.910Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:53:43.631Z","user":{"userId":"978460998","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ed C","accountLink":"/user/id/978460998"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The worst star wars movie ever made","displayName":"Shay S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1458003515/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:53:35.092Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:53:37.406Z","user":{"userId":"976353892","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shay S","accountLink":"/user/id/976353892"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It goes a little fast at first, but then it goes to a normal pace much like the previous movies.
