It's just that I didn't find myself caring about any of them and largely don't remember them after having seen it. \nPlenty of plot but completely lacking in story. Lots of whiz and bang but absolutely no soul or point to it. To be honest it actually felt entirely like an Avengers movie, and I think that should be ample cause for concern for the future of film.","displayName":"Alex H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10154007825675108/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T23:49:43.724Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T23:49:50.149Z","user":{"userId":"978343913","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex H","accountLink":"/user/id/978343913"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Action packed and finished the story while leaving the audience room for creative interpretation for the future.","displayName":"Jeff","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T23:49:20.576Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T23:49:20.576Z","user":{"userId":"6EBAF050-DF01-414D-B675-EB78425011BE","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jeff","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Basically wrapped it up but still leaving comeback for larger story lines .","displayName":"Malcolm C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T23:48:43.506Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T23:48:43.506Z","user":{"userId":"E593A2C7-E1ED-4923-B44D-8443AF74D4A7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Malcolm C","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Im a Star Wars fan have seen them all from the beginning as they came out 40 years great ending tied up all lose ends need tissues","displayName":"Emily","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T23:48:30.815Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T23:48:30.815Z","user":{"userId":"8e13da19-3cd8-43f2-aa8c-81b0608014f4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Emily","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"great action.
