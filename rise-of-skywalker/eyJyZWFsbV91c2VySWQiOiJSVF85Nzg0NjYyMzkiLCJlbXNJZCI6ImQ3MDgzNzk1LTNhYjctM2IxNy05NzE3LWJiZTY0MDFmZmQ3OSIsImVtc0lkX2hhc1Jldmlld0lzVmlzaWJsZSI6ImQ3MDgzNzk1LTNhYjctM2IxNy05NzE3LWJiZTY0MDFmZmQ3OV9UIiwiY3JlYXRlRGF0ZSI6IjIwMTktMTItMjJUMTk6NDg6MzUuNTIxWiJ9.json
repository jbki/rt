It's still Star Wars, and there were lots of good moments in it, but it's definitely my least favorite Star Wars movie.  The humor fell flat and several plot points just took me out of the movie.  The Rise of Skywalker felt like Star Wars again.  Definitely my favorite of the sequel trilogy.  I do see the criticism that the plot is overstuffed as valid, but I think that's a failure of the previous movie basically not advancing the story as it should have.  This is a satisfying, emotional and fitting end to the saga.","displayName":"Steve M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001311751312/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:47:09.008Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:47:15.055Z","user":{"userId":"935239369","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steve M","accountLink":"/user/id/935239369"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I really don’t understand the hate that this movie is receiving.
