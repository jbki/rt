This movie was in it's own way indeed a true Star Wars film. The lore of the sith was far more explored than any thing we've seen in the past. Live action anyway. J.J. Abrams kept good on his promise to introduce a few jedi that we've longed for since their introduction in both Rebels, and The Clone Wars. The movie is full of fan service, and it's core gives everything a life long fan needs to feel for the most part, complete. It's not all praises though, as the movie tends to leap past seemingly significant moments, and make it feel rushed. The return of palpatine was in fact a good call, I just wish that so much of this movie wasn't correcting the mistakes and liberties that Rian Johnson made. I had, for all intents and purposes lost hope (no pun intended) after TLJ, but this movie made me happy for the most part. J.J. Abrams said about a week ago, that force ghosts would play a major role in the conclusion and he was not wrong. I just wish he had portrayed Ahsoka Tano in a better light. \n\nThe lightsaber fight scenes were the best of this trilogy, and the space battles were nothing short of grand. \n\nAll in all, if you loved everything pre TLJ, you will likely love this movie. \n\nIt is with a proud fanship, that I give Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker a 4/5 which... frankly, knowing that J.J. had to atone for previous sins of sith directors... was better than I ever anticipated this movie being.","displayName":"Darren Wookiee R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:39:25.375Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:39:25.375Z","user":{"userId":"89348B87-48B8-4CBA-9439-4E4192EF9113","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Darren Wookiee R","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I think alot of critics are giving this movie a bad rap but in my opinion it wraps up the Skyywalker story pretty good.","displayName":"Johnny H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10218058718516874/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:39:22.370Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:39:36.478Z","user":{"userId":"978461275","realm":"RT","displayName":"Johnny H","accountLink":"/user/id/978461275"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"}]}
