Much more action and less wasted frames than the Last Jedi. Overall the movie really feels more like an omage to nerds with the Sith and Jedi legacy and conflict really brought to the forefront of the story! Not perfect but a very solid showing would definitely watch again!","displayName":"Juan F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10201364715629364/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:44:35.156Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:44:40.333Z","user":{"userId":"978385545","realm":"RT","displayName":"Juan F","accountLink":"/user/id/978385545"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fun movie that balances out everything we've seen from the previous two films.
