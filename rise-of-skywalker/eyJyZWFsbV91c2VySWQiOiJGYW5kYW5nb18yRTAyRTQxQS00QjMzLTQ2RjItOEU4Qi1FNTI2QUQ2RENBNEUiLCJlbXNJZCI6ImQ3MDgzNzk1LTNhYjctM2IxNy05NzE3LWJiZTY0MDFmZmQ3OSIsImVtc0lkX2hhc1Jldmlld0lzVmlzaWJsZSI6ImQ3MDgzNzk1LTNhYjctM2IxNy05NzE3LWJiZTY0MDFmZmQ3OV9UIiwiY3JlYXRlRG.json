I felt like the film fixed a lot of the problems that I had with the previous film.  It brought a lot of our characters together again unlike in the last one.  It had really good twists and I loved when Kyo turned back into Ben. In the end I felt emotional robbed, when Ben died.  Either Ben should have lived, the two last Jedis together or Ray should have died so the Jedis died with the Sith.  Also the movie just cut off no real end to our characters.  Poor Finn.  I felt like they tried to set him up with three different women and didn't end up with any of them and barely even talked to Rose who shared a kiss with in the last movie.  I'm glad this journey is over.","displayName":"Renee C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001245729414/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T08:08:47.934Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T08:08:54.641Z","user":{"userId":"920592608","realm":"RT","displayName":"Renee C","accountLink":"/user/id/920592608"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good addition to the saga.

It’s one of my favorite Star Wars movies and there is so much Star Wars. Oh! Also! It’s a terribly constructed film and it had so much pampering moments to people who have hated moments from the last film(my personal favorite). But, it is fun. It is big.
