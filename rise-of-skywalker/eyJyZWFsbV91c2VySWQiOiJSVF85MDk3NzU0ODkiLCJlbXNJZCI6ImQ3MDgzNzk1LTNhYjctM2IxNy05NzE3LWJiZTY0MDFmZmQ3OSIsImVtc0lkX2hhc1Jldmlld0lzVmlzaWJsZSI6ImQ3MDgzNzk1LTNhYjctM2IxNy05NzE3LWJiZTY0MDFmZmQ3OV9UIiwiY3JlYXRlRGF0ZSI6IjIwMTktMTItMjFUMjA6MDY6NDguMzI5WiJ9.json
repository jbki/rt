However, if you care about the the characters and their story arcs nothing is new with this film as when you get toward the end the weight of the film is lifeless. The movie again has lots of plot holes that have no explanation from the first 5 minutes to the end. The cinematography and visuals is an amazing attribute clashing between the dramatic and fight scenes. overall, I'm happy this saga is over and hopefully we can get an official plan next star wars movie instead of just going with the flow.
