Yeah there were a few things that were really dumb, but there are a lot of dumb things in every Star Wars movie (even the originals). I enjoyed it. I hated TLJ on the first couple viewings, but upon watching every movie in chronological order before watching this one, it grew on me, and when Rise of Skywalker came, I was honestly very satisfied. It was cinematically gorgeous, and I give props to the entire team for finishing off this trilogy with a bang.","displayName":"Jeff L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1014675695341579/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T03:10:41.368Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T03:10:45.034Z","user":{"userId":"976985447","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeff L","accountLink":"/user/id/976985447"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"excellent, action packed movie!
