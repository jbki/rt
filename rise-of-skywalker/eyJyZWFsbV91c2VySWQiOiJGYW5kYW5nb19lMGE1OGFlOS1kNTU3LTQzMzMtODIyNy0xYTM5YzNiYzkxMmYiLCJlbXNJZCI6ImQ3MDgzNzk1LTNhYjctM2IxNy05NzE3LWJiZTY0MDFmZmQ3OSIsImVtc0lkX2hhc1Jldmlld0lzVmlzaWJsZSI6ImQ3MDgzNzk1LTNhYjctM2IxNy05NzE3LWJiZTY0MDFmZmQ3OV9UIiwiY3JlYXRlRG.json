Rise of Skywalker was a little scattered and loaded with too many convenient story-plot points that were rushed and not really earned (in my opinion).   Being a hardcore Star Wars fan i had to see the movie twice.  There were definitely some great action scenes, fun and emotional moments,  and solid acting from everyone.  In the end I was a little let down by the closing chapter mostly due to Terrio & JJ's writing and decision making.  If ONLY the creative group sat down before episode 7 and mapped out a general story structure to go off of.","displayName":"Wesley H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T03:09:11.378Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T18:41:24.271Z","user":{"userId":"978462817","realm":"RT","displayName":"Wesley H","accountLink":"/user/id/978462817"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"JJ did an admirable job of wiping away the memory of The Last Jedi.","displayName":"Dominick T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T03:01:10.023Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T03:56:43.056Z","user":{"userId":"F1EF0190-56F4-4C5C-B4B7-A5A5BF94287C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dominick T","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie!
