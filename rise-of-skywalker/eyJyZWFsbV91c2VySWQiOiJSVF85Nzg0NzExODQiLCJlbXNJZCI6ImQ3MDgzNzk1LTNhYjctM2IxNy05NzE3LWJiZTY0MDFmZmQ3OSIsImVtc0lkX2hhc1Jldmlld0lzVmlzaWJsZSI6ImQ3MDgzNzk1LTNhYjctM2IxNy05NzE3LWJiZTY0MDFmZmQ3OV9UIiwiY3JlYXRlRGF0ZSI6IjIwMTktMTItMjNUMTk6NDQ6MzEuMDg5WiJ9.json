I absolutely loved it and thought it was the best of the current trilogy, edging out the first movie The Force Awakens. I grew up with A New Hope so there is a lot of nostalgia for me and the original trilogy, but this movie had all of the \"feels\" and action you could want in a movie like Star Wars. Were there things that could have brought more clarity, story lines that could have been tied up better, sure, but that is most films. It just seems like everyone wants to bash movies for what they \"aren't\" instead of enjoy them for what they \"are\"! Rant over.","displayName":"Eddie D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/729350169/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:43:33.812Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:43:51.343Z","user":{"userId":"834760673","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eddie D","accountLink":"/user/id/834760673"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What was Fin going to tell Rey?

There are very few good parts but for the most part, it's pretty pad. \nIt's a total mess. This trilogy has no clear line it follows. You'd be hard pressed to find any coloration between this and the last two movies. I'm not going put spoilers in, but a certain character feels rushed, like he was put in last minute, to bait people... I'm very disappointed in this movie and more so in this trilogy, which is wasted potential.","displayName":"Riu F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2264770033805882/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:41:57.687Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:42:04.610Z","user":{"userId":"977824090","realm":"RT","displayName":"Riu F","accountLink":"/user/id/977824090"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Despite the messy trilogy, Abrams salvages what little he could and brought the films to a fan devoted ending.","displayName":"Jacob S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:41:17.743Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:41:22.043Z","user":{"userId":"977674687","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jacob S","accountLink":"/user/id/977674687"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"too many cooks in the Disney Era Star Wars films.
