The  messages sent were that victims of abuse can only obtain validation through sacrifice and that you are also only defined by your patriarchal bloodline.  A disservice to Leia's legacy.  This film largely ignores The Last Jedi and has huge plot holes so large it's insulting to the fans.  The only way for Disney to redeem themselves is for them to literally re-release this movie with the original ending that we know they shot.  Shoutout to Adam Driver for his amazing performance which is the only beautiful thing in this movie.","displayName":"Cheryl B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T05:53:10.582Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T05:53:10.582Z","user":{"userId":"978479062","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cheryl B","accountLink":"/user/id/978479062"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Corporate garbage nonsense","displayName":"Vincent A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/67901028/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T05:52:17.555Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T05:52:21.425Z","user":{"userId":"785147990","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vincent A","accountLink":"/user/id/785147990"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Same old stupid boring story with nothing new.
