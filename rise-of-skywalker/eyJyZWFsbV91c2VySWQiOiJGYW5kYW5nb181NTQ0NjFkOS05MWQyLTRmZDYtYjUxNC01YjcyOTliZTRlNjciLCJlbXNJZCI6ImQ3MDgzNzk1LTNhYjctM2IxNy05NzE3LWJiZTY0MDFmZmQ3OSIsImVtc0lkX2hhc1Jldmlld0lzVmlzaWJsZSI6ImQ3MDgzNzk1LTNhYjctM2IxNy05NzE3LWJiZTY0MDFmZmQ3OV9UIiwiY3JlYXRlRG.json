VII pero sin conseguirlo. Esta película nos muestra una gran discontinuidad con la anterior de la saga, los cambios de dirección no han ayudado nada. Errores \"enmendados\", nuevos poderes de la fuerza que se sienten como un Deus Ex Machina tras otro, ideas recicladas de la Trilogía Original... Un desastre de principio a fin que además se siente demasiado frenético durante todo el film, especialmente la primera hora. Quieren contar demasiado y no les da tiempo.","displayName":"Andrs V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2686988251383926/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T18:36:23.229Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T18:36:34.175Z","user":{"userId":"978498853","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrs V","accountLink":"/user/id/978498853"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I don't know why everyone is hating on it so much.

I wish the movie was an hour longer just because we were hit with so much to process. But overall, solid and it definitely helps if you watch the other two prequels beforehand. There’s lots of little details that you might not catch unless you do. Currently buying a ticket to watch it a third time. Go watch it, you’ll have fun.","displayName":"Natalia","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T18:27:55.686Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T18:27:55.686Z","user":{"userId":"CF35DDF9-BACE-4CD2-948A-24AF0ACBBD63","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Natalia","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I'm no Star Wars buff but I love Star Wars and I loooooooooooved this movie!","displayName":"Margaret","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T18:26:56.916Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T18:26:56.916Z","user":{"userId":"397d3254-6cf5-47af-84eb-47f269d00be0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Margaret","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Always loved the franchise and they did a good job closing loose ends.
