JJ has brought the true spirit of the franchise back to the screen in a massive mind-blowing story that ANSWERS QUESTIONS we have been waiting for since 2015 in a near 2 1/2 hour whirlwind of action, plot, and heart. It is frightening, beautiful and uplifting. I only wish I could have paused it every half hour to take in and digest what I had just seen before moving on. I have tickets to see it again this weekend.","displayName":"Nikolai G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:08:54.540Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:09:01.494Z","user":{"userId":"972702703","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nikolai G","accountLink":"/user/id/972702703"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Somehow jj managed to pick up the pieces of a franchise obliterated by rian Johnson and put a film together that regained the respect and happiness of fans, was exciting for audiences of all ages and finished the story off in a way that everyone could enjoy, except for all the unnecessary kissing","displayName":"Joshua W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2419220548206700/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:08:43.542Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:08:50.751Z","user":{"userId":"978454152","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joshua W","accountLink":"/user/id/978454152"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Who are these critics given it a rotten? It takes the ideas from previous films and wraps everything up. It has a couple neat twists, it looks great, takes a few chances here and there, and left me feeling good about Star Wars.

No. But it's a damn sight better than plenty of movies.","displayName":"David K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/583594359/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:08:41.654Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:08:48.319Z","user":{"userId":"906097786","realm":"RT","displayName":"David K","accountLink":"/user/id/906097786"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Against other Star Wars movies, it stacks up among the best.
