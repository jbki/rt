It could have been better but there was limited continuity in the previous two movies of the continuity.  The first movie led you one way, then the second movie completely led you in a different way.  Then this movie had to fix the issues from the second movie.  If Disney plans to do another trilogy they should plan ahead and coordinate all the movies with other trilogy.  Or just make single independent movies.","displayName":"Irvin L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T00:16:42.983Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T00:16:42.983Z","user":{"userId":"b176f059-8cba-47b4-a15a-6c72c79b0684","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Irvin L","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"wow, that was terrible, predictable, and cheesy","displayName":"Rich","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T00:16:28.673Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T00:16:28.673Z","user":{"userId":"5C616149-4F19-44A0-8372-68EEE514F7A8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rich","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"}]}
