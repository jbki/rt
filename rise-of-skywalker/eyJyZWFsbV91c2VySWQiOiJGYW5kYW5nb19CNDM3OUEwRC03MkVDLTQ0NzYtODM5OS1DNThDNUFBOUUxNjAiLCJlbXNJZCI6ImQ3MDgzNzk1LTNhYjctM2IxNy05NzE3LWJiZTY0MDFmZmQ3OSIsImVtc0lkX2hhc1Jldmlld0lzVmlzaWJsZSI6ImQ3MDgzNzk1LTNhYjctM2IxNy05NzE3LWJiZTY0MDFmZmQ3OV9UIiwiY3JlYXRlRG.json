J. Abrams, but ultimately too late. I almost enjoyed the movie but the fact that the trilogy as a whole makes no sense definitely affected this movie. The end of the movie was pretty much that ruined it for me because of the lame attempt to copy End Game, that they're still trying to get rid of the characters that we love and worst of all the title \"Rise of Skywalker\" makes no sense. Jeez! I mean, I wish I could give it a lower score but that would not be fair. It's just enjoyable.
