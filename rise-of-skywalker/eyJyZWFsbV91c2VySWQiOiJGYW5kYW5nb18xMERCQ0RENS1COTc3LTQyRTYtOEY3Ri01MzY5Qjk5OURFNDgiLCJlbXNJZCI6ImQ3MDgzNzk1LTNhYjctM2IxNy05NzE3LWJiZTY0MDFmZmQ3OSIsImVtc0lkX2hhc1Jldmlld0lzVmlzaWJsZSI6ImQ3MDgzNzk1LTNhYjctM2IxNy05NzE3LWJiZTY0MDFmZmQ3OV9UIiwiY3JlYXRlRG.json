The rest was a disjointed mess of a movie with poor pacing, story, character development and dialogue. It felt like it was time to make a 3rd movie and these people just threw together what they could in order to close it out. There was not much regard for making a compelling movie. It seems their main goal was to simply end the trilogy. The beginning sequence was quite painful to watch what with the Mickey Mouse Club banter. The story is almost non-existent with the same formula we've seen for years. George Lucas is a brilliant and gifted storyteller and filmmaker. He can take a formula and weave a culture around many facets of the mythos. It's sad but Disney and the new Lucasfilm can't recreate his genius. I think most fans already know this. This movie is honestly as much of a mess as the 3rd Matrix. Remember that garbage? So, I agree with all the comments about Rise having super amounts of fan service but I would have sacrificed all of that for a great movie. The only concession I have to offer is that there are a few moments where the movie is fun and entertaining. Other than that, it's just a sorry shame and a huge disappointment. The only way that this movie could possibly be redeemed is if they somehow have an extra 1 hour of movie for the director's cut and it's a true epic. Then maybe I could warm up to this. I'm not going to hold my breath.","displayName":"Dan N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T08:24:17.082Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T08:24:17.082Z","user":{"userId":"af6d13d7-fe24-4152-83dd-4b748c8ee07b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dan N","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I wasn't wowed as expected, but it was alright.","displayName":"Nikki S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T08:19:45.073Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T08:19:45.073Z","user":{"userId":"DA2FE824-11F3-4478-9B74-0B7B56472AE1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Nikki S","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"I donâ€™t like how Star Wars is relying on visual cues rather than a story line","displayName":"Chris","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T08:18:40.909Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T08:18:40.909Z","user":{"userId":"B1DABD67-8FD7-443B-B92F-B9ED41058739","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chris","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Just as bad as The Last Jedi, mess of a movie and plays it too safe ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T08:16:30.502Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T08:16:30.502Z","user":{"userId":"260346574","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260346574"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"nostalgic, and captures your interest","displayName":"mr.failure","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T08:12:40.219Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T08:12:40.219Z","user":{"userId":"15BA6300-D068-4FB7-83FB-3AAE7C00C5F7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"mr.failure","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"The story does not make a lot of sense.
