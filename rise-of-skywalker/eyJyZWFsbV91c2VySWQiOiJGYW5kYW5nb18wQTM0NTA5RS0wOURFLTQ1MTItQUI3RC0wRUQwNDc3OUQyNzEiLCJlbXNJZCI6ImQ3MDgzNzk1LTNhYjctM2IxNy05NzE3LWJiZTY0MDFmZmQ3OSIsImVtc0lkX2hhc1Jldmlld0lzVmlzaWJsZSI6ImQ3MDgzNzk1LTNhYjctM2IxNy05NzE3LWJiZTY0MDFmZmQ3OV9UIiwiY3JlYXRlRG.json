It gets off to a very clunky start and there are definitely some missed opportunities, but the ending is satisfying. The action sequences and battles are great.","displayName":"Joe E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/526202081/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T21:06:26.813Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T21:07:15.061Z","user":{"userId":"857897076","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joe E","accountLink":"/user/id/857897076"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"loved everything about it the best one if all","displayName":"Melody","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T21:05:18.651Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T21:05:18.651Z","user":{"userId":"626E9E4E-4EDD-48A5-AC77-E0FBF8596496","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Melody","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I'm selling all my Star Wars stuff.","displayName":"Ozzy N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/591717764527506/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T21:01:19.019Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T21:01:19.019Z","user":{"userId":"977205048","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ozzy N","accountLink":"/user/id/977205048"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"While taking a look at this sequel trilogy in retrospect, these 3 movies definitely didn't go in the direction I thought they would. And I still hope that someday they can make movies outside of the Skywalker saga that delves into the Force more. Star Wars can afford to go in a different direction and not always have to rely on being \"retro\". With that said, I loved Rise of Skywalker. It was a fun movie and that's all I need as a die hard Star Wars fan. Yes, it's obvious that this trilogy wasn't mapped out the best it could have been, but this series has always been clunky in that way in my eyes. The makes decisions during development, some work, some don't. They typically learn from the worst and continue to make each movie as enjoyable as possible.\nWhy a 5 star rating despite pointing out all of these things? Because I believe it's the flaws that make Star Wars fun. Also, I'm growing tired of living in the Internet age where we find out about production issues and such. At the end of the day, this movie was a blast. Of course there were things I myself would have done differently, but I do not take ownership of this story. I know that upon rewatching these new movies alongside the others for years to come, my love for them will grow as they always have from year to year. Star Wars is timeless. It's my favorite series ever, and this movie ranks right up there as one of my most enjoyable installments.","displayName":"Dave B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/556815030/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T21:00:53.983Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T21:00:53.983Z","user":{"userId":"792716670","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dave B","accountLink":"/user/id/792716670"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I enjoyed it quite a bit.
