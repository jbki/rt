Relies too much on the past so much so that the main characters in this film seem to have backtracked to where they were in The Force Awakens. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren continues to be the best part of this trilogy, mainly because he has a character, and action scenes were choreographed well. Overall, a recycled mcguffin plot followed by a recycled Return of the Jedi plot, which was already recycled in The Last Jedi, so doubly recycled","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:02:23.862Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:24:05.800Z","user":{"userId":"890685406","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/890685406"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"DIsney garbage….

In a single movie you rescued the most important story of my childhood from Lucas' embarrassingly bad prequels and Johnson's unbelievably out-of-touch TLJ. This movie restored my faith in the franchise and was everything - and more - I was hoping it would be.  WELL DONE!  I will see it several times - the last Star Wars movie I did that with was The Empire Strikes Back.","displayName":"Anthony M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:01:57.790Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:01:57.790Z","user":{"userId":"978453150","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anthony M","accountLink":"/user/id/978453150"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Over all, it is the best of the new saga","displayName":"Sergio G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:01:55.021Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:01:55.021Z","user":{"userId":"2579c869-e531-4157-b901-e2a4ae1b93c4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sergio G","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Some of the scenes felt contrived but overall I found the film satisfying.","displayName":"Robert G.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:01:54.439Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:01:54.439Z","user":{"userId":"6403F8D0-30BC-4282-9649-4592F478C2F9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Robert G.","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was amazing.
