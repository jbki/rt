The instructions are that you have to present your presentation in less than 10 minutes. Your presentation is very creative, very artistic and everyone likes the animations and images that you put in the presentation. But you had to pass the PowerPoint slides very quickly and explain each slide fast to finish your presentation on time. Leaving the audience distracted by their beautiful presentation but confused that you don't have time to explain their work.","displayName":"Alexis X","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000787035902/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:38:55.945Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:39:00.511Z","user":{"userId":"899930960","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alexis X","accountLink":"/user/id/899930960"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"a wonderful installment to round out the Skywalker story!

Some parts of the storyline seemed rushed. I feel it needed at least one more movie to wind down the story lines. I love this saga as I grew up with it from the start. But after the finale I felt a little underwhelmed. Dont get me wrong, its a great movie but it wasnt epic which is what I was expecting and hoping for.","displayName":"Carol R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:38:40.541Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:38:40.541Z","user":{"userId":"ef0ba7ea-567c-4807-acbc-49e1c6e399ff","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Carol R","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
