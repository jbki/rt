There are a few plot holes and unanswered questions, but this is mainly due to Disney controlling JJ Abrams' vision. By the end of the movie we're asking ourselves, what did Finn want to tell Rey?\" One of the most popular answers is that Finn loved Rey and wanted to tell her, but that's not what Abrams intended. In a scene that was removed from the final cut, Finn tells Rey he is force sensitive. We even see hints at this in the movie. Also, bringing back the Emperor was a good choice since we were left without any real villain at the end of The Last Jedi. The Emperor was someone we feared in the earlier movies and bringing him back created a bigger picture for the First Order and good vs evil. There was no time to introduce a new villain and this was someone we were already very familiar with.","displayName":"Jonathan T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T21:17:54.227Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T21:17:55.288Z","user":{"userId":"978499037","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonathan T","accountLink":"/user/id/978499037"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"JJ spent most of this movies runtime cleaning up the mess that Rian left.","displayName":"Jesper S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T21:13:51.586Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T21:13:56.790Z","user":{"userId":"976988074","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jesper S","accountLink":"/user/id/976988074"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I thought it gave good closure to the running story yet still left room for continuation and story arcs.","displayName":"Stuart R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T21:10:56.103Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T21:10:56.103Z","user":{"userId":"9e184158-a28f-4d56-a4dc-04f5a84c5cb0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Stuart R","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The good: Loved this movie.
