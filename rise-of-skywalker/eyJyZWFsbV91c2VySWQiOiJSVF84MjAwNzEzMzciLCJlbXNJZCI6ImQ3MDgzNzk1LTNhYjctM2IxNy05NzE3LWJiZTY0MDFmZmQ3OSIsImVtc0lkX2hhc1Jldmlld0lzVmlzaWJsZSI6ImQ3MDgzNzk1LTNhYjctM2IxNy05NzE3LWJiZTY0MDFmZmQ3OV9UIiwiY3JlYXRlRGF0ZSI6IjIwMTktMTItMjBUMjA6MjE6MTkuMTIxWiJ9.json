The pacing is horrible, and feels like several movies quickly edited together. None of the action scenes are even worth while, and are passable at best. And at the end all we have is a trilogy that leaves us in the exact same spot as the end of Return of the Jedi, without adding anything substantial to a saga that spanned 40 years.","displayName":"Emi R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:20:53.869Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:21:05.608Z","user":{"userId":"926100370","realm":"RT","displayName":"Emi R","accountLink":"/user/id/926100370"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Ya good ending to the story....","displayName":"Jay K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000094466358/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:20:47.967Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:20:53.329Z","user":{"userId":"959236426","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jay K","accountLink":"/user/id/959236426"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Terrible, the writing is the worst.
