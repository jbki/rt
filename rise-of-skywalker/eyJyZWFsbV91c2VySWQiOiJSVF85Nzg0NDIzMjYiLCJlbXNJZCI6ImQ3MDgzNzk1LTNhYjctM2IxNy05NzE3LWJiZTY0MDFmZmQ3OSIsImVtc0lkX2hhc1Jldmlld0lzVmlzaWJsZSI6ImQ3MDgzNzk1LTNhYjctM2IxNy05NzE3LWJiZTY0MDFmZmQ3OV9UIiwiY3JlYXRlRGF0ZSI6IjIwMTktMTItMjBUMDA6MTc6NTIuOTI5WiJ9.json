Nothing really.

The perception on the sequel trilogy in total and the perception of the Rise of Skywalker itself. \n\nThe sequel trilogy is completely flawed by not having a masterplan in advance and the contradicting directions JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson took. \n\nIf I look at the Rise of Skywalker as a rsult of the mess before, its actually pretty good solved to bring everything to an end and to bring all the pieces of the puzzle together. But as a single movie its to stuffed with revelations, story pieces and character devolepment is happening on such a speed that many actions are not plausible.\nIt has to achieve what Last Jedi should have done and does a lot of reconning. \n\nJJ Abrams does what he had to do, but is it a masterpiece? Definetely NO!\nIn total the whole sequel trilogy is pointless and we end up at the same point as we have been at the end of Return of the Jedi.","displayName":"Hugo M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3131357790224122/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:16:59.641Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:17:08.847Z","user":{"userId":"978381042","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hugo M","accountLink":"/user/id/978381042"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"tRoS provides an unoriginal, uncreative and ultimately just plain boring end to a trilogy of unoriginal and uncreative films, and happily sends of any character development for a 2hr fuckfest of Macguffin after Macguffin, and pointless character after pointless character, ending in a climax that proves just how much the new trilogy lacked any personality and creativity","displayName":"Theo J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:16:43.364Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:16:48.453Z","user":{"userId":"975523838","realm":"RT","displayName":"Theo J","accountLink":"/user/id/975523838"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Last Jedi hurt the story they try it to salvage it creating a mediocre movie with plot holes and inconsistencies and a fan service check list make sequels look like masterpieces The sequels have their shortcomings but at least they were original  and tried things","displayName":"Christoforos  A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:15:40.402Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:05:50.342Z","user":{"userId":"975630995","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christoforos  A","accountLink":"/user/id/975630995"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Absolutely unoriginal, breaks all star wars lore.
