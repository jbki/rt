I hope that they either let this alternate universe die, or maybe decide to start making the E.U. Movies, maybe that will bring their profits back.\n\nWhen you take a risk of destroying the original canon to make your own; you have a good chance of falling on your face. This series went multiple directions. The use of different directors and pandering to the P.C. culture, you are going to have a difficult time getting it to work.\n\nThe most hilarious part of this whole thing is that they constantly say that they have no source material for reference.","displayName":"Marc W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3126873717341317/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T17:50:40.322Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T17:50:47.423Z","user":{"userId":"978492518","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marc W","accountLink":"/user/id/978492518"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"}]}
