The reveal itself suggests the entire purpose of the Skywalker family was to distract Palpatine long enough that he have children of his own that would one day kill him. It renders the entire family saga rather meaningless. What could've been an epic and final dual between the daughter(Rey) of the son (Luke) and the son(Ben) of the daughter (Leia) is now just Palpatine vs. his grand daughter, and all the Skywalkers are dead.
