This movie felt like if you are a kid who was forced to eat vegetables last night so then today you go to an all you can eat buffet and just binge at the dessert table. It looks awesome and tastes pretty OK for a while but it's not very satisfying in the end. \n\nNothing but a checklist of nostalgia and course correction.","displayName":"Javier S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/663287444/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:00:36.022Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:05:07.709Z","user":{"userId":"802876007","realm":"RT","displayName":"Javier S","accountLink":"/user/id/802876007"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"people need to stop hating. a little long but very good.","displayName":"Joseph C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:00:35.056Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:00:35.056Z","user":{"userId":"28D049D7-A802-4345-AE59-15B71054B852","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joseph C","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I thought It was an amazing conclusion to the Saga, for a Star Wars fanatic it made me happy, I do hope down the road there are more standalone Star Wars films, It feels like so much happens over 2 hours but It's well worth it especially if theres an IMAX theater nearby!","displayName":"Kevin A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:00:32.750Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:00:32.750Z","user":{"userId":"7df894c5-0b21-449e-89e9-fa13bc98c2c6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kevin A","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best of them all!!!","displayName":"Andrew B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:00:27.785Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:00:27.785Z","user":{"userId":"c42dd72b-cb0a-4f7a-b343-d685f92585a6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Andrew B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"I just felt like they invented too many superficial plot points and tried to unnaturally shove too much in.","displayName":"Just ok","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:00:00.340Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:00:00.340Z","user":{"userId":"650e195b-6f13-411e-b306-8185736dd4f0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Just ok","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"They did try to fix the mess they made with the previous part of the story and I think the story line with all the new concepts they added was great. I think it was a great way to end both the sequels and the whole star wars story line as a whole. Maybe I'm being overly positive considering what a mess the previous episode was but let's not forget the hate people expressed for the prequels which were pretty decent movies. You can't expect them to make the movies so they fit with everyone's expectations. Rogue One is still the best Star Wars movie overall. Your nostalgy won't change my mind.","displayName":"Svetlin T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2477298202342794/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T19:59:48.720Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:00:20.379Z","user":{"userId":"977795268","realm":"RT","displayName":"Svetlin T","accountLink":"/user/id/977795268"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"a somewhat fitting end to not really the saga, but the sequel trilogy, I thought it was a good movie, with good motives and a movie that really wanted to please the fans, if you don't like this movie, you're not a star wars fan","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T19:59:40.308Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T19:59:40.308Z","user":{"userId":"260291345","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260291345"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good but predictable.
