I didn't like the rushed pace of the movie. It seemed too much in a hurry to get to the next battle or confrontation. The action scenes were well done however. I also didn't like the misuse of the character Rose Tico. TLJ established her as an important character and TROS kept her completely in the background with little dialogue. I thought there would have been a romance between her and Finn. Rose could have filled the role that Jannah provided. Last thing I disliked was that the ending felt messy. The things that worked for me was the conflict within Rey, who prior to this point in the trilogy, seemed invincible. The banter between Finn and Poe was cool. The Ben Solo/ Kylo Ren journey was well done. The Emperor as always was well acted and served as a great villain. Two things I was meh on was the C3PO mind wipe scene, it had little impact because he got his memory back. Also the Rey/Ben kiss scene felt forced, they didn't really have any dialogue or scene in the trilogy to make that a good payoff. Overall I think that not everyone will enjoy the movie because of internet opinion and the fact that Star Wars has always been a series that changes people's opinions over multiple viewings and over the test of time.","displayName":"freddie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:37:37.463Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:37:37.463Z","user":{"userId":"6C770FE0-8ECE-4458-9873-200E0FBF0420","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"freddie","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Same story over and over.
