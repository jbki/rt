The film was amazing, and would have been far better only if JJ Abrams didn't have to repair all the disasters that the Last Jedi created (thanks Rian Johnson). Meanwhile critics will find a way to dislike it, and ignore the epic conclusion to a Shakespearean tale of Space Opera created by George Lucas over 40 years ago.","displayName":"Charlie K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10159024468185516/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T09:26:43.014Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T10:01:49.111Z","user":{"userId":"976587056","realm":"RT","displayName":"Charlie K","accountLink":"/user/id/976587056"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Yeah baby yeah Rey and pow","displayName":"Dane W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2695770794010494/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T09:17:50.750Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T11:21:04.724Z","user":{"userId":"978469188","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dane W","accountLink":"/user/id/978469188"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Perfect end to my childhood ❣️","displayName":"Ruby Springer","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T08:59:32.881Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T00:16:48.737Z","user":{"userId":"F4117900-F49E-4F5E-9E8B-575442A3DB98","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ruby Springer","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"To my surprise... I really enjoyed it. A major course correction from the abomination of the subversive and nihilistic, The Last Jedi. With Rise of Skywalker I laughed a lot, cried some, and cheered with the audience!

There was a lot of repetition, and no theme that hadn't already appeared somewhere in the Star Wars cinematic universe stood out. \n\nThe reveals in the movie seemed to exist solely for the purpose of a \"gotcha\" moment. While the concepts were interesting (and honestly could have been better explored for a more fulfilling movie), the rest of it raced by, almost as if they didn't want the viewer to stop and think about how many plot holes there were. Entertaining, but ultimately disappointing.","displayName":"Jeffrey T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1434978970002569/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T08:42:30.765Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T09:04:16.699Z","user":{"userId":"978469101","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeffrey T","accountLink":"/user/id/978469101"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Underwhelming.

I liked the \"Rise of Skywalker\", I keep things into prospective and enjoy it for what it is: a very well done tale, first told George Lucas and now by Disney. Wouldn't you wish you were a fraction of how successful they have been? Just enjoy it for what it is...
