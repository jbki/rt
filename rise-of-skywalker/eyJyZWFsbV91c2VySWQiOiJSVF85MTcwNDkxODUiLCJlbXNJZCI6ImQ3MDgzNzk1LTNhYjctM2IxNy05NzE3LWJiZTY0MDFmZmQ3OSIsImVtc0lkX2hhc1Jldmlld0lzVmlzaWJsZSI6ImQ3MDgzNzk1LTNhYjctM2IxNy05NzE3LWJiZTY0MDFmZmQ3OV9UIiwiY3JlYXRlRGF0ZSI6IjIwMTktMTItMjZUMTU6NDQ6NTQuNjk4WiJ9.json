My young grandkids enjoyed as well.  My only regret is having first read Richard Brody's \"New Yorker\" review, and thereby having the trilogy's singular essential revelation spoiled for me and I'm guessing literally dozens of others.  Perhaps certain self-aggrandizing critics should spend less time searching the Thesaurus for polysyllabic terms and more time focusing on how meaningful service might be performed for the benefit of both audiences and their employers.","displayName":"Rod K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T15:43:37.077Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T15:43:37.077Z","user":{"userId":"978480070","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rod K","accountLink":"/user/id/978480070"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"good story line, true to the series. ended well","displayName":"gerard s","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T15:43:32.527Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T15:43:32.527Z","user":{"userId":"ee023691-df36-4845-a707-b5b1380b08c3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"gerard s","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"criticism comes with all movies and honestly they did amazing with the movie.  i watched it 3 times in a row n cant get enough of it.  great job filmmakers,  writers,  cast,  and crew.

You can tell that the filmmakers didn't have any real story to tell. They were made to make money without regard to any other purpose.
