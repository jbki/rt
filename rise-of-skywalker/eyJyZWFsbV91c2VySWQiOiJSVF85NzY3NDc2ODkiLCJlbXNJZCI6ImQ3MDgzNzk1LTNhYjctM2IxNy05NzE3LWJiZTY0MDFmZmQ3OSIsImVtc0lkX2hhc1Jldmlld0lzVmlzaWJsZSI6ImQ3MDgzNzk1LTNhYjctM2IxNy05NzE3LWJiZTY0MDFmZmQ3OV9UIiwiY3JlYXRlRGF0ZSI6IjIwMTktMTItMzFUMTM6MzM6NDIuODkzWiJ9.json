I really loved it and thought JJ did a wonderful job tying the 9 films together. Also, we have learned that critics apparently don't understand Star Wars at all because they loved The Last Jedi and most of the fans hated it. They don't seem to like The Rise of Skywalker and all the fans I know are loving it. My advice? Don't listen to the critics. Go see this movie and you will most likely enjoy it.","displayName":"Nick T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10100874111101580/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T13:28:55.764Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T13:29:09.339Z","user":{"userId":"972425771","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nick T","accountLink":"/user/id/972425771"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A good end to the story. a little too many Disney elements inserted.","displayName":"Google","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T13:28:52.721Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T13:28:52.721Z","user":{"userId":"69c46bcf-5c8c-4dd4-91f7-183523d5e209","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Google","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Insane Special effects and great plot!","displayName":"Bryant","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T13:28:23.566Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T13:28:24.106Z","user":{"userId":"4c7ec973-34aa-4efb-aa11-98a33d51921b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bryant","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I think it was the best one of all the trilogy!

No plot. Boring movie. Zero development of characters. Whatever is convenient for this portion of the story happens: no matter how much sense it doesn't make. Childish dialogue.

Interactions between Poe, Finn and Rey felt thrown in, with very few memorable moments, let alone interesting in any capacity. Felt very crammed, especially Poe's new backstory. New characters like Zorri are not interesting and don't have enough screen time to be memorable. Palpatines return ruins Anakin's redemption in ROTJ. No scene ever stays still long enough to let it resonate emotionally or plot-wise. Awful film, and a disgrace to the saga and movies in general. Don't worry Star Wars, JJ can't hurt you anymore.","displayName":"Matthew","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T13:21:47.888Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T13:21:47.888Z","user":{"userId":"74a20ca1-2175-4c38-a9b2-8d58819c415e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Matthew","accountLink":null},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"A mediocre must not miss finale to the Star Wars trilogy of trilogies.
