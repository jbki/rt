The movie starts out going 100 mph and doesn't slow down for over 2 hours. If it slowed down at all you'd be able to think about the bad decisions the characters make and why they have to go macguffin hunting for most of the movie. The story contradicts existing rules set down by the previous movies, making it hard to understand why things are happening on screen. We won't get any explanations from anyone on screen, such as what is and why we are \"Lightspeed Skipping\" or where did \"Force Healing\" suddenly come from. We shouldn't need to read the visual dictionary to know why some things are happening. Rey, Chewie and C-3PO all have big character defining moments in the film, but in the very next scene for each the consequences are undone. There is an entire story line that can be removed and the overall story would be unchanged, from the festival scene to the meeting with Hux can be removed, and nothing would change.     The fact that JJ Abrams walks back almost all of the events from The Last Jedi is the only reason for the half a star.","displayName":"Joseph N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T14:12:45.020Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T14:12:50.123Z","user":{"userId":"906389964","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph N","accountLink":"/user/id/906389964"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very well done, music was intoxicating and the special effects were well, special.","displayName":"Stephen","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T14:11:34.775Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T14:11:34.775Z","user":{"userId":"1ea873ef-af39-4915-a077-3bf231a38b42","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Stephen","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie!
