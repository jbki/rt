A story trying to do too much with too many in too little time. And ultimately disappointing.\n\nAs a final in the saga it left myself, and other viewers in the cinema, feeling ... not much of anything except short of satisfaction. The dialogue was for the most part missing any connective tissue, with most scenes standing alone as characters repeatedly leapt from one issue in one location to another issue in another location. This alone had the effect of killing any kind of emotional impetus. The cast seems to have expanded at the cost of time for characters from the past two films. Between all that it seems the sum total of more (characters and locations) is less (time for character development, agency).","displayName":"Paul J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T12:42:37.795Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T12:42:45.432Z","user":{"userId":"977080649","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paul J","accountLink":"/user/id/977080649"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A great end to a dynasty.","displayName":"Joseph","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T12:39:23.727Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T12:39:23.727Z","user":{"userId":"2b1447bc-9755-4170-b1cd-a05939ff7029","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joseph","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Garbage.

In fact by comparison to TLJ it's very good. That's why 3 stars. It is however not the film the fans or the franchise deserves. Comes across a lot like a damage limitation exercise. It's a good film for the initiated but when you think about what could have been it's still not nearly as good as it should have been.","displayName":"John M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T12:30:58.829Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T12:31:11.867Z","user":{"userId":"977599770","realm":"RT","displayName":"John M","accountLink":"/user/id/977599770"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"So tiresome.
