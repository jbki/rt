Didn't want to go see in on Christmas and spoil Christmas. Well...I was wrong.  Loved it.  Fixed everything that I thought was wrong with Jedi, and not in a lame way.  Plenty of action, \"realistic\" space battles, no \"why did they do that?  that doesn't make sense!\" moments.  Thoroughly enjoyed and ready to go see it again.","displayName":"Joe","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T18:50:08.586Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T18:50:08.586Z","user":{"userId":"a9e051f4-510d-4ab4-b5af-02bf9a2b3d30","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joe","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"I like the action in this movie, but besides the action, the storyline made no sense. The three movie did not connect except for the actors. I love that Carrie Fisher wa used in the film, but it was so forced. They made the scene around her unused scenes and it showed. This movie just killed all the lore that happened with return of the jedi. How the hell did they bring back Palpatine? That was so stupid. All film are subjective, but this was a disappointment for a star wars movie.","displayName":"Harry W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-28T18:49:59.460Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T19:23:07.873Z","user":{"userId":"6105A81B-9290-4CA2-92AC-988DA0AB685F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Harry W","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Personally I loved the movie, I know most of the Star Wars nerds are disliking this movie.
