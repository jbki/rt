I was laughing at how hard JJ retconned some aspects of The Last Jedi, ( ex. Rose being left behind to scrub toilets, practically, while all the main characters that people like go on an adventure to save the galaxy) but that's what most fans wanted and I did like all the story choices. I wish those changes had been set up in prior movies, but The Last Jedi obviously went in a very different direction that JJ wanted. The movie has also obviously edited out some key information and plot lines. What is this force dyad? What did Finn want to tell Rey? How is Lando connected to Jannah? Still, despite some fast pacing and some unexplained returns and changes, the movie had me entertained all the way through and did deliver a satisfying arc for every character.","displayName":"ben p","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:35:29.088Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:35:32.984Z","user":{"userId":"781854306","realm":"RT","displayName":"ben p","accountLink":"/user/id/781854306"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Very good movie.

I think anticipation really does kill. I have never gone to see a movie a second time within 24 hours EVER in my life but I had to see it again first thing the next day. 11am in an empty theater I saw what I went to see the first time. The movie is amazing, what a epic finale. Sure it was over the top and jumped around and they didn't stay still long enough to explain anything but the whole thing is worth it for Babu Frik and the Final Scene. So Good.\n\nAnd for the haters... Show my another NINTH installment of a franchise that is anywhere near as good. Most are Direct to Video by the time they hit 4 or 5.","displayName":"Mike M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/554625056/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:35:15.031Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:37:37.269Z","user":{"userId":"802152585","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike M","accountLink":"/user/id/802152585"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Everything was awesome !

Clearly the best of the franchise. The story, pacing, and action sequences are extremely well done. This movie found time not only for epic battles, but a fun adventure threaded throughout.\n\nMy favorite part? Devoting screentime to systematically unraveling The Last Jedi piece by piece. Luke and the Jedi? Good guys again! Rose is invited to join the adventure but is forced to say, \"Oh I have to stay off screen. You guys go form a core friend group without me\". The Finn / Rey attraction that was dropped in TLJ is brought back in a believable way that gets me excited to see their relationship.\n\nThe piece de resistance (pun not intended)? While planning the battle, Pippin suggests the \"Holdo Maneuver\" and is immediately shut down as being a one-in-a-million chance to work.\n\nBut seriously, the heart of Star Wars is a Jedi being tempted by the dark side and overcoming their fear. Thank you for restoring Star Wars to everything it should be and more!","displayName":"David F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/758805277/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:35:08.803Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:35:15.477Z","user":{"userId":"789060825","realm":"RT","displayName":"David F","accountLink":"/user/id/789060825"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
