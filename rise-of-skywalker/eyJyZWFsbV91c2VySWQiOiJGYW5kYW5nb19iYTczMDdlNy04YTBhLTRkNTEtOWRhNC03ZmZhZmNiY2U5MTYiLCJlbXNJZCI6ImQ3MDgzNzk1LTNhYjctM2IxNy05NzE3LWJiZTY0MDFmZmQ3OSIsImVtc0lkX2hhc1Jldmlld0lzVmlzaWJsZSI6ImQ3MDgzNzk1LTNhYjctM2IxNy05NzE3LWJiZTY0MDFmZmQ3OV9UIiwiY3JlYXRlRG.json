I have been a fan since I was a kid just before the prequels came out. It's a bit messy, a little rushed at times, probably could've been a 3 hour movie, but overall I had a really good time at the theatre. Please do not listen to the critics. It's not perfect but it has some amazing moments and does well by the original trilogy. The whole trilogy should've been written a little better and planned ahead, but JJ Abrams did the best with what he had.","displayName":"Jake M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:23:09.652Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:23:15.182Z","user":{"userId":"976931493","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jake M","accountLink":"/user/id/976931493"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"So bad.
