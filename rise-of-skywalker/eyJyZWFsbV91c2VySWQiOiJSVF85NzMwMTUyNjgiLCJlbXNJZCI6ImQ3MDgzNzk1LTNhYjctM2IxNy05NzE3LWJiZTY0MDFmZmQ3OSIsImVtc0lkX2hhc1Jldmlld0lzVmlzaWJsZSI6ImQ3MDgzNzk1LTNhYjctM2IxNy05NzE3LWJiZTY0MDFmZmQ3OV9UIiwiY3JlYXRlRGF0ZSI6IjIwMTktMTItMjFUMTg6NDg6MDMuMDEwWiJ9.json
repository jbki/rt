Abrams did a spectacular job at closing out this Saga. I only wish that he would have been in charge of The Last Jedi so this trilogy would have had more continuity. While it seemed a bit rush, it tackled most of the unanswered questions still lingering. I count that as a win considering J.J.'s Lost end debacle. Still a must see and I can't wait to see it again.","displayName":"John L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1067123617/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:47:19.377Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:47:29.262Z","user":{"userId":"862298546","realm":"RT","displayName":"John L","accountLink":"/user/id/862298546"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"too much repetition of previous episodes","displayName":"Jerry A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:47:05.420Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:47:08.626Z","user":{"userId":"d2966cfc-d83f-46a3-bb5d-123b78db4490","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jerry A","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it.
