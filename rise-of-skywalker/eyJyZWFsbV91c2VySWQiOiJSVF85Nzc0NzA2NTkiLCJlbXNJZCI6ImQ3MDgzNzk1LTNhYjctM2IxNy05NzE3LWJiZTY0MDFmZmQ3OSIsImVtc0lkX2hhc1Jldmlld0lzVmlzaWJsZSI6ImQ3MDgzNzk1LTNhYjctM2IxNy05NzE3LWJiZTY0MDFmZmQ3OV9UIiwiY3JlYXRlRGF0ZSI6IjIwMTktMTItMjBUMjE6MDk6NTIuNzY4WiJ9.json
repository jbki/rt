Finally JJ did get to remake the Last Jedi in the first half of this movie. It was pretty ridiculous in parts and over the top in others, but it was FUN, and that's what star wars should be. Lots of clever and heartwarming callbacks to OT, prequels and both previous sequel triology films. He took the good stuff from TLJ and expanded it, and got ride of the bad stuff. You finish TLJ confused and betrayed, you leave this one crying and happy. That says a lot.","displayName":"Damon R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:09:14.231Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:09:17.607Z","user":{"userId":"977022494","realm":"RT","displayName":"Damon R","accountLink":"/user/id/977022494"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
