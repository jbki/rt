That said, it is a very entertaining film that does a nice job of wrapping up the franchise with a few interesting twists, fun action sequences, and just enough fanservice without going over the top. It's probably my least favorite of the sequel trilogy, but is still a good Star Wars film well worth seeing for fans of the franchise.","displayName":"A.j.
