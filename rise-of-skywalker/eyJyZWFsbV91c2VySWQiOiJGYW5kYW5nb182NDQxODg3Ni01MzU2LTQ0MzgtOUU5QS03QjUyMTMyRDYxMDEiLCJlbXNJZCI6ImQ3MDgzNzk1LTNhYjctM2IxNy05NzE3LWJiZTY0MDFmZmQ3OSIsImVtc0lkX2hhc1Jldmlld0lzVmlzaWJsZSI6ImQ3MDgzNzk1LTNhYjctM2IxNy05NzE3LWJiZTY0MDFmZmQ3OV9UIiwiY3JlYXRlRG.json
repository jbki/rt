After the disaster knows as The Last Jedi, I felt this movie brought closure and did the entire series justice. The story, acting and all just felt right. I know some say the Last Jedi was better (sorry, Leia flying in space was enough to make the entire movie a joke to me). I found Rise of Skywalker entertaining as well as satisfying. I recently watched most of the other movies in the series (and now wish I hadn’t), Skywalker very much holds its own.

A few too many bows on the end of story lines. Perhaps the film was hampered by the desire to keep Leia as a main character.
