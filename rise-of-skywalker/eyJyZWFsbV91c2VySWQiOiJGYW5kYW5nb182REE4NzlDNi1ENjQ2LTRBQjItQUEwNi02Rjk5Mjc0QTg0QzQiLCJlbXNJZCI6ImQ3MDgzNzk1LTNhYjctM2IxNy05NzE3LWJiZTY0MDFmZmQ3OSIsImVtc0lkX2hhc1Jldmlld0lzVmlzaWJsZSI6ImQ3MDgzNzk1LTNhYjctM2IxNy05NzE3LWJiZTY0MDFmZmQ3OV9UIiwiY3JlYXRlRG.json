I wanted to hate 9. I'm a fan, I watched the movies, swtcw, Mandelorian, the spinoffs, I've played the games. I loved it. If anything, I would say everything before an hour into the film was pretty worthless, and then there was a distinct turn around in style, character development, acting, and quality film making that completely redeamed the first two of the series and rekindled my love for starwars.
