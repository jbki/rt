I know many other folks have picked this movie apart, but let's be real in the fact that \"the force\" will never die (like this cash cow franchise) so they had to have just enough plot holes to be able to leave an opening for more side character movies, spin off shows, etc. \nAll adults and kids in our family who went enjoyed it. It's a movie about space wizards. Take it with a grain of salt and enjoy it.","displayName":"Jen","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T16:15:12.635Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T16:15:12.635Z","user":{"userId":"1febe9db-dab7-4e88-8739-4b76acf4dcc2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jen","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"12h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great to see independent, strong, intelligent female leading roles that have depth of character, powerful yet vulnerable, caring, and awesome.
