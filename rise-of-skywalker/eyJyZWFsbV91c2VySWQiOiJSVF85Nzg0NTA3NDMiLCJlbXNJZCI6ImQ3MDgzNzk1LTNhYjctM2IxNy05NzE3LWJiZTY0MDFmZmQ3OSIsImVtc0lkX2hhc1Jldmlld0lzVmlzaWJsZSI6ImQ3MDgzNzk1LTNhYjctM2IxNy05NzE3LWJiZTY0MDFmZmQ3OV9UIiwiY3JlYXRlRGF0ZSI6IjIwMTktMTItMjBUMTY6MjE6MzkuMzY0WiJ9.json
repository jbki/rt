Two very different filmmakers openly attempting to undercut each other at every turn, has resulted in a spectacular lack of vision and cohesion for the overall trilogy. One of them tries to \"subvert\" expectations in the lamest way possible, while the other fruitlessly attempts to give the fans what (he thinks) they want. Both gentlemen, however, have roundly failed to deliver that one thing that is more important than risk-taking and safe-playing: a actual GOOD movie trilogy. \n\nI'm glad they're giving this franchise a lengthy pause after this, because I can practically hear the drawing board yelling at everyone to come home.","displayName":"Matthew D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:20:57.125Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:21:54.340Z","user":{"userId":"900700863","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew D","accountLink":"/user/id/900700863"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Bloated first half, with far too much going on. Not much character development, and some characters that had significant set up in the previous movies pushed aside. Leia's appearances had little spark. Some poorly done misdirection. Lots of MacGuffins, lots of quests of questionable utility, and a huge Chekov's Gun. I found myself wondering about the Force at some points. But a reasonable re-interpretation of the villain and the relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey saves the movie.","displayName":"Phillip R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:20:05.643Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:20:12.826Z","user":{"userId":"976962231","realm":"RT","displayName":"Phillip R","accountLink":"/user/id/976962231"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"a fitting end to a forgettable and numb feeling trilogy. this movie felt like it was on fast forward the entire time with the plot unfolding so fast and so messily it seems the entire thing was shot out of a machine gun. i can see why george lucas wasnt at the premiere its a terrible star wars film and i cannot believe this was green lit and made it to the big screen. kathleen kennedy needs to go.","displayName":"Austin S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/610733090/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:19:05.119Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T11:21:02.919Z","user":{"userId":"902846473","realm":"RT","displayName":"Austin S","accountLink":"/user/id/902846473"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Everything in the past is back again","displayName":"jim t","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T16:19:03.393Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T16:19:08.554Z","user":{"userId":"978450643","realm":"RT","displayName":"jim t","accountLink":"/user/id/978450643"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"It is hard to find things to like in this film.
