Great to finally see Rey, Poe and Finn come together! Yes, there are a few plot points that might annoy die-hard fans, but if you want big blockbuster entertainment, you can't get a better send-off!

I understand the conundrum for JJ abrams after \"the last jedi\". Lot of patches to sew in this episode. However, some characters loose strength, new ones bring nothing new to the plot and horses on the spaceships are the last stroke of genious. Mamma mia... apart from the healing powers never seen before... they only create more loopholes ... still it's star wars universe and we enjoy  it despite the flaws.

Spent an hour and a half hunting Macguffins before getting to the meat of the movie.   There are a couple of scenes that conjure up the magic of the original trilogy, but they are buried in an otherwise joyless endeavor where the stakes seem impossibly low (despite the universe being at stake, ostensibly).  Add to that a washed out color palette and embarrassingly uninspired visual effects and you've got, well, I guess what we've come to expect from Disney.   At least Solo was fun.","displayName":"Jek Porkins","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:43:12.598Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:43:12.598Z","user":{"userId":"1688aafc-0dd7-491c-a973-06e1f7152f70","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jek Porkins","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"}]}
