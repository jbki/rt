The arching continuity and storytelling choices weren't for me. The characters finally came into their own far too late in this trilogy. the force is a religion not a plot device. Where Shakespeare used death as a plot device or to write a character off, JJ Abrams seems content on giving us some strong 'Forever Young's vibes.\n\nHopefully Feiges influence lends to a better vision for Disney's Star Wars going forward. Kathleen Kennedy has amazing credits to her name but she Busch Leagued this trilogy.","displayName":"Jared J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:28:43.508Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:28:50.546Z","user":{"userId":"977090915","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jared J","accountLink":"/user/id/977090915"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It's an okay ending to the saga.

Sure it was a little goofy but after episode 7 and 8 I have not let it get me distracted from the awesome Star Wars action that is taking place in front of me. Overall, it was an excellent addition to the Skywalker Saga and by far the best of the sequel trilogy. It was obviously hampered by steps that were taken backwards by the last Jedi.","displayName":"Jake O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:28:33.352Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:28:33.352Z","user":{"userId":"978454276","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jake O","accountLink":"/user/id/978454276"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved it!
