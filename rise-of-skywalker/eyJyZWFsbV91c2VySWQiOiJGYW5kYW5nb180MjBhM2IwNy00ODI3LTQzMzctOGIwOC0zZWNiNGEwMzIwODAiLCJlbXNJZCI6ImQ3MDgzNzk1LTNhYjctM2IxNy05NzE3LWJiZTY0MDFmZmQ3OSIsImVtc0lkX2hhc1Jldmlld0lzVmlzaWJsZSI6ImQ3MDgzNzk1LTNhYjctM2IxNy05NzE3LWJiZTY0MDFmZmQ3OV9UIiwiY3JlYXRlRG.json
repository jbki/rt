It was really good and after seeing it a second time, it may be my new favorite. Hating on the Star Wars movies has become a new industry on the internet.

I'm 41 years old and a fan of the original trilogy first and foremost, but I'm not one of those rabid, reactionary fans who seem determined to hate anything new. I had some problems with 7 and 8, but largely liked them. This 9th film is by far the best of the sequel trilogy, and I don't know how it could have been executed better.\n\nI had concerns about the film going in, but they proved to be unfounded. Considering the 8 films that proceed this one, I just don't know how it could have been wrapped up any better.\n\nThe movie is fun, it has heart, it answers questions, and it's the satisfying conclusion that Star Wars deserves.","displayName":"Nate O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:54:56.329Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:55:08.851Z","user":{"userId":"978471208","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nate O","accountLink":"/user/id/978471208"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The movie was really great , the only down thing is that it was compacted , but definitely a MUST WATCH","displayName":"Mohammad A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000182416824/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:54:25.122Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:55:36.537Z","user":{"userId":"971460448","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mohammad A","accountLink":"/user/id/971460448"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It was a awesome movie had a good time with my bro","displayName":"Richard Perez","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:54:08.407Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:54:08.407Z","user":{"userId":"4b2c0abf-1dba-420a-9880-a278921639e1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Richard Perez","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It’s definitely the best movie of the newest trilogy, although there’s maybe 30-45 minutes of stuff anybody would wanna see.
