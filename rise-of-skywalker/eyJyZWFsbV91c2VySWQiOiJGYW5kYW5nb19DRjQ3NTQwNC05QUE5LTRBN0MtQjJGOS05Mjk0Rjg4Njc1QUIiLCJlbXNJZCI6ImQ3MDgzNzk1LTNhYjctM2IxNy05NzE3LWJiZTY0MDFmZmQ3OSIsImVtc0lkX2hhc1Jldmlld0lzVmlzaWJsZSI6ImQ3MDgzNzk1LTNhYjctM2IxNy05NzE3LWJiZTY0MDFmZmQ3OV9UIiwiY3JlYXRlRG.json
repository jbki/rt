But as part of a whole, it is very disappointing, doesn't make sense, and only serves to give some fanservice while wrapping up a disjointed story. The latest trilogy kinda blows. But hey. The visuals are pretty neat, and Adam Driver did come around to be good in the role. I did not like him in TFA, so at least his part came out good, even if the character arc didn't fully make sense.","displayName":"James A T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T19:19:58.287Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:20:39.093Z","user":{"userId":"978043791","realm":"RT","displayName":"James A T","accountLink":"/user/id/978043791"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie best of the series","displayName":"Jason","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T19:19:27.189Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:19:27.189Z","user":{"userId":"C6A2D6A3-CAE6-42FB-926E-BB9DC8C1B26F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jason","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It had a lot of action and a girl super hero.","displayName":"Shelia W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T19:19:06.805Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:19:06.805Z","user":{"userId":"149b10eb-cc65-4c3f-bc7a-80c87452fb7c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Shelia W","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Welp. This was an unnecessary course-correct if I ever saw one. It's not Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones bad, but the thing that frustrates me about this film is how instead of telling a great story with great character development, it relies on cheap fanservice that honestly felt like fanfiction.\n\nNow we get to Palpatine, which is definitely not a spoiler, as he's been shown in the posters, he's heard in the trailers, and even Ian McDermaid's name is on the poster. The reasoning for him being in this movie is so incredibly stupid, and I can't give away why, because explaining it would be a spoiler.\n\nI'm not as mad at the film itself as much as I am at Disney for caving into angry fanboy demands. They showed no spine with this film, and it doesn't even feel like a story created with the cooperation of the writers, director, and the studio as much as it feels like fanfiction with unnatural development.\n\nThere's definitely some good stuff here. The visual effects are fantastic, John Williams never wastes his time on his last Star Wars score, etc. But, as a whole, I'm ashamed at Disney for not sticking to their vision, regardless of the backlash The Last Jedi initially got.","displayName":"Christian H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/545119485875623/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T19:17:34.119Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:20:03.218Z","user":{"userId":"977991743","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christian H","accountLink":"/user/id/977991743"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Continued piss poor writing by this franchise.

Scenes from the Sith planet are huge, but have little pay off.  Rey, Poe, and the rest evoke little emotion and seem like the  actors are going through the motions. Rey retains her Mary Sue troupe, though at least she did some Jedi training this time.  A lightsaber battle through mental projection is laughable.  I hope they next set of Star Wars movies goes to a completely different time, maybe the old republic era.","displayName":"Greg B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T19:08:36.618Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T19:08:36.618Z","user":{"userId":"977280248","realm":"RT","displayName":"Greg B","accountLink":"/user/id/977280248"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"}]}
