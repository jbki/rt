Movie is convoluted, crammed with way too much new plot, planets, and characters that makes it a scatter brained mess. JJ jammed every Star Wars reference he could think of in to this movie and flashed enough lights on the screen that it should cause permanent retina damage. This very weak Star Wars feature is the result of Kathleen Kennedy not having a plan for this trilogy. She and Bob Iger should be fired for how they destroyed this franchise. Billy Dee Williams was great as usual. Best scene is John Boyega looking around the happy Resistance crowd at the end of the film - I swear he is searching for his script.","displayName":"D C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T17:41:29.043Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:16:20.682Z","user":{"userId":"976925822","realm":"RT","displayName":"D C","accountLink":"/user/id/976925822"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"}]}
