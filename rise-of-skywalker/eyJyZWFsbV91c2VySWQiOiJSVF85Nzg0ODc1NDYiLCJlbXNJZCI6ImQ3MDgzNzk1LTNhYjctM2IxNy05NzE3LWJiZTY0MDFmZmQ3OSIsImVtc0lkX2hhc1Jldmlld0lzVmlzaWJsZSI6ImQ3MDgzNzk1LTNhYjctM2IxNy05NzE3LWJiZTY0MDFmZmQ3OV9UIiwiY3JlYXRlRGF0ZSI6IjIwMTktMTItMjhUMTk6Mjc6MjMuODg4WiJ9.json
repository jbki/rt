(Spoiler free) This movie was fantastic! 8 out of 10 stars! It hit and successfully hit the ground running, every little thing was made big! Ray had a good ending to her story, along with kylo Ren. Something were strange and dragged on but at the end it all came back around. The vfx and cg was out standing as always. So in my final conclusion is that its star wars! I think people are more mad at the fact that this is the end of the Skywalker story, but not really! (Its Disney they going to milk it tell the cow is dry) that all being said yes there are some things still needing answers, but that is why god or who ever you believe in gave you Imagination! #dontspoiletherise","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T19:22:32.861Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T19:22:32.861Z","user":{"userId":"953155457","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/953155457"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"At least this one had a proper bad guy and good flow with a bit of a surprise turn which is far from the other two attempts.

The best Star Wars since the originals in my opinion is The Mandalorian!
