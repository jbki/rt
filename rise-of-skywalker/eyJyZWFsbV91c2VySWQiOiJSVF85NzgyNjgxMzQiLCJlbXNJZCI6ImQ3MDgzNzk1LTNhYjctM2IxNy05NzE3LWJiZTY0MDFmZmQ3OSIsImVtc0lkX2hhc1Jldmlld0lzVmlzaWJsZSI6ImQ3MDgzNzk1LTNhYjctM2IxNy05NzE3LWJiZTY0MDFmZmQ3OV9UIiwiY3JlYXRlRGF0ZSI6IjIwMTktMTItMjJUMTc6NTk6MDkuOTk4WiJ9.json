JJ Abrams makes a point to appeal to the fans of all 3 eras of the Star Wars trilogies that emotionally concludes these stories without making the same mistakes as The Last Jedi did. While critics compliment Rian Johnson for his work in episode 8, the people that truly matter, the fans, get redeemed in this final installment. The Rise of Skywalker embodies central themes George Lucas effortlessly created in the original trilogy. It is witty, adventurous, and transformative. This film transports you to a world only one can dream of, a world devoid of angry critics and bitter Disney haters.","displayName":"Jack B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T17:59:02.676Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T17:59:02.676Z","user":{"userId":"978465727","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jack B","accountLink":"/user/id/978465727"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Itâ€™s not the movie we deserve but is the movie we got.
