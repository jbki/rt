Abrams took all the nostalgia he could and threw it up against a wall and prayed some stuck. Abrams also decided to mess the the original trilogy's ending making the first six movies erroneous. This movie is not the rise of skywalker but the rise of the Palpatines. The Skywalkers are ultimately defeated fully and utterly by Palpatine. While this is a better movie than the dumpster fire of The Last Jedi it is a convoluted mess that ultimately destroys the Skywalker story ending a legacy with a crushing defeat!","displayName":"Aaron L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3590856004287994/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:51:51.356Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:52:08.664Z","user":{"userId":"978463663","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aaron L","accountLink":"/user/id/978463663"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"While there is fun to be had, most of this final installment relies on call-backs, nostalgia, and cameos to tie together what the Last Jedi left us with- a doomed the movie from the start. J.J. Abrams did his best to piece together what was left into a formidable conclusion but ultimately, shoved too much rushed exposition in our faces and had the audience make too many leaps of faith throughout which will leave viewers more confused than entertained by the end. The main protagonists are still without much backstory and three movies in are less-interesting, watered-down versions of: Luke, Han Solo, and Leia. With little character development, the action scenes throughout seem almost meaningless all-the-while fitting in numerous tropes taking away any kind of threat at all. Rey, the queen of little backstory, has unbeknownst to her more power than she even realizes making quick work of every threat with little to no struggle further distancing the viewer from her. However, the one saving grace about the story is without a doubt Kylo Ren. Not only is his character arc interesting in itself but his conclusion in this movie (while not surprising) did him justice. While the story as a whole comes crashing together to form a shaky finale, there were a few bright spots within the film that saved the movie. Some of the conversations between the old and new guard characters hit the right notes passing their blessing onto the next generation. Also, the amount of effort put into the cinematography payed dividends creating a place and creatures with whom any viewer is bound to love. Ultimately though, the lackluster story throughout these three movies killed the spark which made the prequels so memorable.
