The world is horrible enough as it is at the moment without adding yet more misery to it.  Why could you not redeem Kylo Ren/Ben Solo AND let him live?  Where's the Happy Ever After?\n\nAdam Driver was WASTED in this.  He out acted everyone around him, including as Ben Solo when he said the grand total of one word which was \"oof\"\n\nIt gets half a star for the Reylo kiss and the Ben and Han scene.  The rest was a mess. The movie was shallow and inconsistent, lurching from fight scene to fight scene. No time for proper dialogue or character development.\n\nI haven't been this disappointed by a film for years.","displayName":"Kate W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10158718825121808/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:38:35.110Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:40:17.847Z","user":{"userId":"978451461","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kate W","accountLink":"/user/id/978451461"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Una gran película para una gran saga","displayName":"Alberto C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/169358234457559/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:38:29.299Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:38:38.398Z","user":{"userId":"978451499","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alberto C","accountLink":"/user/id/978451499"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I went into this movie after seeing a lot of negative reviews, with an open mind. I'm a life long Star Wars fan and is a large part of my life. I absolutely disliked The Last Jedi, and this film seems to try and fix a lot of the issues the previous movie left. At the end of the day i thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I actually liked the fast pace, the non stop action, and old characters returning. I left the theater satisfied as a Star Wars fan, but there were a few things i wish they would have done differently. I recommend this movie if you're a true Star Wars fan.","displayName":"Dustin M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3108445892502899/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:38:21.649Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:38:25.666Z","user":{"userId":"978451481","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dustin M","accountLink":"/user/id/978451481"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great way to end the Skywalker saga!

What didn't fall off of it made it in to the movie.\n\nIn terms of characters, they mostly fall flat. Adam Driver did probably most of the work here ... which isn't saying much considering that he played a very two dimensional character.\n\nLogic is almost none existent at this point. I know people come to its defense saying that its a fiction, but with the thing is that even fiction needs to have rules and logic that makes sense in its own world, in order for it to work. Otherwise there is nothing keeping it from becoming chaotic. \n\nMost of what I saw today was an afterthought, considering how fast it goes trough story beats, and tries desperately to do damage control after TLJ.","displayName":"Nandor S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001450327600/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:38:06.929Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:38:59.948Z","user":{"userId":"929696135","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nandor S","accountLink":"/user/id/929696135"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing thank you jj for finding a way to close out starwars and fixing Johnson mistakes.","displayName":"Matt S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2563686163716712/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:38:05.725Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:38:11.960Z","user":{"userId":"978451494","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt S","accountLink":"/user/id/978451494"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"This would have been better as 2 movies.  They tried to cram too much into one film.  Probably great if you just want to see fights and explosions.  Not enough character development for either returning or new characters.  Too many cameos which would be lost on folks not familiar w/ the 8 previous films. Very little dialog and some of that was barely worthy of a B movie.  Sadly, not a fitting end to this series.","displayName":"Memmie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:38:04.655Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:38:04.655Z","user":{"userId":"DABE95B9-F33E-404C-B434-2AE48FDB7DA8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Memmie","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I’ve been reading a lot of misconceptions on the internet about certain scene or ideas in the movie that are obviously explained in the movie if you pay attention. given the circumstances of episode 8 I think this movie does a good job of fixing the story and leaving it an a good place for now...lots to dive into in the future.
