I did not believe they could steep lower than TLJ, but they managed it. I was laughing the entire time and constantly spotting dumb errors that spit in the face of everything that has come before it. The movie breaks its own rules countless times, creates total double standards amongst characters, invents contradictory lore, has zero consequences for any of the characters (prime example being C-3POâ€™s sacrifice meaning absolutely nothing, and both Rey and Kyle somehow knowing how to force heal others, a power they just made up). My friends and I will love hating this movie for a long time coming, as it is a masterclass in how to mess something up in the most optimal way. What a disrespectful, soulless piece of trash.

He fixed the wrongdoings from The Last Jedi (thank god!) and kept the story moving at a solid pace. JJ nailed the dynamic between Rey, Poe, Chewy, BB-8, and Finn. I loved seeing these friendships develop even more within this film, but I wish I could have seen even more before the end.
