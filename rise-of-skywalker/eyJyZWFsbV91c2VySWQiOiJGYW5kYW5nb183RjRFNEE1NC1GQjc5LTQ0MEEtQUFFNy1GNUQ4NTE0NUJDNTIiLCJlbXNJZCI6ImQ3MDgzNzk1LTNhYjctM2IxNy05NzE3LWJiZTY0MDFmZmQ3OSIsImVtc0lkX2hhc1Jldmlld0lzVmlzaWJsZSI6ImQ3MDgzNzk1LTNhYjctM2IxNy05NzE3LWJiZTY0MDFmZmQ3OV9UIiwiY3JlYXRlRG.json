It leaves you with more questions than it answers. The script and plot are also very cliche, almost as if pulled out of a Disney princess movie, stressing the power of friendship and trust, something I would not want to waste two hours of my life for. Some parts just made no sense, like Rey's attempted abandonment of society. It was quite unnecessary and weakened the already flawed plot. The movie was overall unimpressive and 2 hours too long.","displayName":"Sarcasm X","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T04:08:22.837Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T04:08:26.245Z","user":{"userId":"978494712","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sarcasm X","accountLink":"/user/id/978494712"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"While the movie overall was good, it sure seemed to drag on for no real reason.

Abram's hastily crafted bandage the series deserved after the butchering that was the previous film. While redeeming and charming in a few aspects, it ultimately comes across as rushed and lacking. It was perhaps the best they could do with the given time and resources available. If more time was given as well as more thought, this could've been the ultimate grand slam. With the damage already done, it still manages to finish in a moderately respectable manner. It is a watchable film that will entertain, but leaves plenty to be desired.","displayName":"Brendan T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3051696168188442/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T04:01:47.830Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T04:01:51.202Z","user":{"userId":"978497535","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brendan T","accountLink":"/user/id/978497535"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"We enjoyed the movie we love all of the Star Wars movies. :)  However, we didn't think that it was as good as some of the others.","displayName":"HollyMom5Fam","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T04:01:03.114Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T04:01:03.114Z","user":{"userId":"0CACE954-8D9F-4651-94F2-ADCB7C0B336F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"HollyMom5Fam","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"So, we saw Episode 9 tonight. I've got to say that of the three newer episodes, 7 and 8 respectively, I liked this one the best. I feel as though it tied up a lot of loose ends and added some new storytelling elements to the franchise as well as some surprises I didn't see coming. It also shed some light on just how dark the dark side actually is. It's just my opinion, of course, but I would recommend this film to anyone who may be feeling hesitant about ending the Skywalker storyline. I feel like it was worth the full 2 hours and 20 minutes.","displayName":"Billy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T04:01:01.587Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T04:02:18.786Z","user":{"userId":"8A71B6D0-6404-4E98-8C1E-71F7EA51BF08","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Billy","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I loved this movie, it wasnt perfect but that is an impossible task.
