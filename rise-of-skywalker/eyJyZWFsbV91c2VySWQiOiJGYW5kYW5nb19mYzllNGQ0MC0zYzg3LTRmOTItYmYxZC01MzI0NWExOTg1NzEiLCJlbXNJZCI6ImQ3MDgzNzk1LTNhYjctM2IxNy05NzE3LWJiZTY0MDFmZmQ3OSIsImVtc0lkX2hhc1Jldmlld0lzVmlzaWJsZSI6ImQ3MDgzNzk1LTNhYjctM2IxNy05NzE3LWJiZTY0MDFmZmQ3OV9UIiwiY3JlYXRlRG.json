Lots of great elements, some legit emotion and on its own, it’s a fine movie. BUT heading in to this new trilogy, my only hard requirement was that it not take away from the OT. That req was not met.

Far better than the previous two and I personally would rank it below the original trilogy and slightly better than Revenge of the Sith. Thanks to The Last Jedi, it basically had to convey a trilogy's worth of information in one movie all while paying homage to all of Star Wars in a grand finale, and JJ Abrams did his job. Cinematography, CGI, and soundtrack were incredible. The acting was fine. Loved that Rose was effectively nonexistent and that they left off developing Finn's useless character line which allowed audiences to connect more with the storyline of Rey and Ben Solo. Instead, we got a much-needed pair of bros in Finn and Poe to break the ice (though some of Poe's emotional lines were laughably bad). It was a good balance of Star Wars fun, storyline salvaging, and paying last respects to the franchise that has entertained millions for 30 years.","displayName":"Ron Swanson","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:37:23.994Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:37:23.994Z","user":{"userId":"a04dd4a8-9d0d-4ed8-b4e1-755f095b0951","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ron Swanson","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I thought this was a good way to end the Skywalker Saga.
