It makes a few concessions, in part due to the poor storytelling from the previous movie and in part due to Abrams predispositions to always reach a conclusion. However, the movie had incredible CGI, improved worldbuilding and added extra dimensions to previously flat characters in a meaningful way.

We HAVE to see it as fans of the genre and story since 1970s, but OMG what a waste. Maybe it was impossible to meet our expectations, but Avengers pulled it off spectacularly. Why not Star Wars? That question will haunt us forever as money will be made for the Mouse House,  but fans will have wasted their time AND money. Nice try, good intentions by J.J. Abrams but he failed to create a creative story for us to care about. We CARE about Star Wars for over 30 years but why end like this.
