My only 'flaw' I saw was the first half was edited TOO tightly... so full of action it takes a minute to register and catch up. Its 2 hours 21 minutes.. and the story could EASILY handle 2 hours 40 min and let it breath. Mostly in the first half... it clocks better in the second half. But that's a nitpick.. I'm a old man raised on the original trilogy lol - it still works and I was amazed how good it was. I knew it wouldn't 'suck' - but at the same time I had had no idea this was coming at me. Im at 90% happy... give me 15 minutes more character moments 5 min here 5 min there (PLENTY OF ACTION already LOL) on 4x, bluray or whatever and I'll be at 100% - this is a rare film that gives us TOO much at once. Cant wait to see my second view on Sunday and my 3rd on Wednesday. Is it a flaw to have too much great!!!","displayName":"Timothy W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/738549988/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:28:03.128Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:28:09.376Z","user":{"userId":"856878503","realm":"RT","displayName":"Timothy W","accountLink":"/user/id/856878503"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Solid effort.
