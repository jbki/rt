In almost all the movie there's action including lightsabers fight and it doesn't get boring, an amazing plot twist, and references and places of the original George Lucas trilogy. The only reason I don't give this movie a 5 star the ending is good but If I was the director I would change some stuff In the ending.","displayName":"Leobardo V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T22:14:02.178Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T01:11:57.613Z","user":{"userId":"978461398","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leobardo V","accountLink":"/user/id/978461398"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fantastic Story !
