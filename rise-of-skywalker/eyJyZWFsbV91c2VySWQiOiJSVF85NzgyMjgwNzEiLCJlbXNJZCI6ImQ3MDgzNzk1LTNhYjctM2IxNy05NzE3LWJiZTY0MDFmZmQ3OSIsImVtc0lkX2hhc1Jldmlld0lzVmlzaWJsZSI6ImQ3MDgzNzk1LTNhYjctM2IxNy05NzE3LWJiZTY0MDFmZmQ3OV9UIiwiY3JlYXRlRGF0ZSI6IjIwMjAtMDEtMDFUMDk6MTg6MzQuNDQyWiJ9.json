This movie was way better than many give it credit for. Rey is such a great character! \nWho cares about the insignificance of Snoak? The true puppet master was always behind the dark side. But none of that mattered as much as the development of our trio of new characters (with a good balance of other old and new characters). \nFor me, the most impactful quote from the trilogy was from Rose: \"not by fighting what we hate, but saving what we love.\"\nHaters just had overly invested expectations.\nThis movie has tons of nostalgic moments, badass sets, excellent characters and an impressive musical score.\nI was worried what Disney might do with the Franchise. Between this trilogy, Rogue One, and the Mandalorian, they've really stepped it up.","displayName":"Eric L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2020-01-01T08:34:09.850Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T08:34:09.850Z","user":{"userId":"978495739","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eric L","accountLink":"/user/id/978495739"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"love it!!!!
