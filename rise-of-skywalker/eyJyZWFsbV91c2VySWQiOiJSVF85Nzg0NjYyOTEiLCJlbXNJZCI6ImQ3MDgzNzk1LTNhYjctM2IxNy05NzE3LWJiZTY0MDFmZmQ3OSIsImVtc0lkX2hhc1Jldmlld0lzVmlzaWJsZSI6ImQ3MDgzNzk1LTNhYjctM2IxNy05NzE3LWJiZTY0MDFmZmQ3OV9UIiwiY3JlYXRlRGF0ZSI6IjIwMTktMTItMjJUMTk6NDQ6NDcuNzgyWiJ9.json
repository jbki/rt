A few of the characters a bit underused. Nice cameos by others. Still get kind of creeped out seeing Princess Leia and knowing that Carrie Fisher is dead and didn't shoot a single frame for this film. And seeing her daughter Billie Lourd \"talking\" to the character - even creepier. But overall - a fitting sendoff. Should definitely be seen on a big screen. And all this from a less than stellar Star Wars fan. Loved Empire Strikes Back and the last 3 the best f the 9.","displayName":"Michael E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:44:39.571Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:44:39.571Z","user":{"userId":"3f762edb-b30a-41ce-9488-6b9ace5f2c48","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael E","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Epic, nostalgic and fun.

No. Was it the best of the franchise? No. Was it a solid film, and decent conclusion to the franchise? Yes. Yes it was. It was fun, and exciting, and emotional, and a lot of what I'd expected and predicted. And maybe that's the key issue...maybe people spent so much time analysing/dissecting/predicting what would happen that because it didn't, they're disappointed...? Maybe people need to (re)learn to go and watch a film without that level of pre-conceived expectation, and just enjoy it (or not) for what it is, not based on the imagined experience that they built in their head the past two years... It was an enjoyable ride if you sit back and let it be.","displayName":"Sharlene G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:44:03.263Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:44:11.331Z","user":{"userId":"978195777","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sharlene G","accountLink":"/user/id/978195777"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Satisfying conclusion to the series, with a good blend of action sequences and warm nostalgic wrap-ups for the original trilogys heroes.","displayName":"Raddawg","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:43:59.929Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:43:59.929Z","user":{"userId":"f9ddca5b-1135-41e5-82a9-e4b8bc84d9e0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Raddawg","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My wife and I thought it was very well done.  Loved the story line and the acting was good for a Star Wars movie.   It was amazing how they made Carrie Fisher come back to life.  I also loved how they tied in the past movies with this.  I listened to several of the on line critics and think they are being critical just to be critical at this point.  They can't say it was good or they liked it as they fear losing subscribers.","displayName":"Murray P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:43:56.898Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:43:56.898Z","user":{"userId":"70fa0900-8c59-4dc9-b29d-b6fae4552e18","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Murray P","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The film steals shamelessly from the expanded universe. And that´s one reason why it´s actually pretty good. As a long time fan who knows more then the films I saw many familiar things which do belong to Star Wars for me. But I understand that people which only know the films and nothing about the expanded universe have trouble to accept and understand many aspects of Episode 9. Blame is on Disney for not letting J.J. direct all of the films and for declaring the expanded universe for non-canon and ignoring it up to Kathleen Kennedy declaring the making of Star Wars films problematic because there where \"no hundreds of comics and books\" to draw inspiration from. J.J. Abrams did exactly that, Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau did the same with \"The Mandalorian\" and they proof that it is the right way.","displayName":"Heiko E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:43:51.865Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:43:56.605Z","user":{"userId":"978437071","realm":"RT","displayName":"Heiko E","accountLink":"/user/id/978437071"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A great romp, doing it's best with what it had. Sadly this movie suffers the most from the lack of direction on this trilogy (and the Star wars series as a whole) \n\nDisney, Marvel practically gave you the guide book on how to do this- why didnt you give it to Lucasfilm or did they just decide \"naaaaah lightning will strike again, we know it in our hearty heart hearts!\"\n\nBUT! Despite that I absolutely enjoyed this film. It's no Casablanca, and it's defenitely no Empire. But it is a good film that is a LOT of fun.","displayName":"Jeremy C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/563939060617421/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:43:02.831Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:43:06.749Z","user":{"userId":"976972061","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeremy C","accountLink":"/user/id/976972061"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I like it! just like Kylo's helmet.. broken,  patched,  battle worn, scarred but somehow worked!!","displayName":"H.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:42:52.251Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:45:30.637Z","user":{"userId":"DD3BD7FD-B091-4168-9CAD-95973C462EBA","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"H.","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Amazing visuals, a lot of great moments, but it took the story in the wrong direction, had horrible pacing, and tried too hard with fan service in place of good story-telling.
