The plot was extremely rushed and should have been spanned across two movies ,at least, instead of squished into one. However, You could tell that Director J.J. Abrams was trying to make the movie connect the dots that was left and created, terribly, by The Last Jedi.","displayName":"A A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T01:05:44.302Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T01:05:44.302Z","user":{"userId":"978497246","realm":"RT","displayName":"A A","accountLink":"/user/id/978497246"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I know call me crazy but I think out of all the Star Wars movies EVER, what a great movie ..do yourself a favor and watch at an IMAX.","displayName":"yamiyamz","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T01:05:08.633Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T01:05:08.633Z","user":{"userId":"CCC1B981-73B1-4A3F-B08E-5D816024CDE5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"yamiyamz","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"not as good as the first trilogy, but kept me involved throughout. still adjusting to the idea that the saga may be ended. nooo can't  be!","displayName":"Mary L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T01:04:58.342Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T01:04:58.342Z","user":{"userId":"F68C7742-B3B1-48FC-B4A3-B7633ED4ACE8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mary L","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I'm 76 and I've been watching Star Wars since the first movie.  This movie was a beautiful, heart-string tugging round-off of all the characters and all the stories and a wonderful tribute to our Princess. The Force is real, living as the willingness to do good in every being across the galaxy, especially Rey Skywalker, of course. This was, by far, the best Star Wars movie. Seen today at Majestic 10 in Williston Vermont.","displayName":"Jim D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1359295975/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T01:04:49.935Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T01:05:08.201Z","user":{"userId":"911456362","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jim D","accountLink":"/user/id/911456362"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A fast paced and fun conclusion to the Skywalker saga.","displayName":"William","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T01:04:44.546Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T01:04:44.546Z","user":{"userId":"96fcd236-82e1-41fa-b030-760613afcbd2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"William","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Though flawed for obvious reasons, it's a fun, fitting end to the Skywalker Saga.","displayName":"Landon M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T01:04:43.102Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T01:04:47.642Z","user":{"userId":"976448743","realm":"RT","displayName":"Landon M","accountLink":"/user/id/976448743"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I donâ€™t care what the critics are saying.
