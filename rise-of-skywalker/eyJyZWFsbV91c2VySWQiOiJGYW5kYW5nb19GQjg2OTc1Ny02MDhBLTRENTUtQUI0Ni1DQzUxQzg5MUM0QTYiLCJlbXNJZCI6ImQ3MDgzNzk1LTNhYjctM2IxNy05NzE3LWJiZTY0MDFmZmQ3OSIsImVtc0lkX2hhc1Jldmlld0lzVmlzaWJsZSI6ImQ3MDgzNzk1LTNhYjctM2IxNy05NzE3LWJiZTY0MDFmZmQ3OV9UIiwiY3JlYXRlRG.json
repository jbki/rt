This felt like JJ Abrams did his best to salvage the story he started from the Rian Johnson expectation-subverting chainsaw. \nHopefully Disney learned their lesson : You can't slap StarWars on a movie and people will automatically like it. You need to actually do good movies with good storytelling.","displayName":"Pierre-Luc B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10162087446505084/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T02:30:18.403Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:19:34.916Z","user":{"userId":"978054135","realm":"RT","displayName":"Pierre-Luc B","accountLink":"/user/id/978054135"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Not perfect, but it definitely satisfies and had me feeling my childhood all over again.
