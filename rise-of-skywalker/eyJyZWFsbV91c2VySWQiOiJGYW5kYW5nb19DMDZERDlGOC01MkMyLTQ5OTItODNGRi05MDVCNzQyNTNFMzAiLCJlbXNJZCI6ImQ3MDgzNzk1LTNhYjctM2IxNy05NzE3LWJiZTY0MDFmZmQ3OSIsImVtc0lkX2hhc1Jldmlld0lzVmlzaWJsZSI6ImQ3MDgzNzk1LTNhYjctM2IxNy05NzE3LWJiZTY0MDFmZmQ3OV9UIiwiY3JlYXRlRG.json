THANK YOU FOR THIS AMAZING EARLY CHRISTMAS PRESENT!\n\nWent in with low expectations after the disaster called The Last Jedi. Had given up on Star Wars after being a fan from the release of the first film in 1977. This film has saved Star Wars for me, and acknowledges on several occasions that The Last Jedi is best ignored and forgotten. If JJ's remit was to bring back the core fans, he has succeeded.\nDisgruntled Star Wars fans should view The Rise of Skywalker as a protracted apology for The Last Jedi, and simply enjoy a movie which is orders of magnitude better than the other two in this trilogy. \nOrder has been restored, the 'group thinking critics without critical thinking ' are giving low marks to a Star Wars film, whilst the audience ratings are 30% higher.","displayName":"Donald M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:18:51.118Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:25:53.602Z","user":{"userId":"978287003","realm":"RT","displayName":"Donald M","accountLink":"/user/id/978287003"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"whole movie was great going to see it again!!!","displayName":"Jordan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:18:47.323Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:18:47.323Z","user":{"userId":"5ED99A0A-08A7-40FD-9067-68270F06458A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jordan","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
