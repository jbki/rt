It had a cartoon/animated feel. It patched together a story relying heavily on the nostalgia of previous characters to fix a broken series. The movie jumps around too much, abandoning the original formula of a three act play. The characters have no real connection with the audience and basically I'm just happy it is over.","displayName":"Edward C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:25:32.154Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:25:48.535Z","user":{"userId":"977031021","realm":"RT","displayName":"Edward C","accountLink":"/user/id/977031021"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Don't care about the critics.

For a film that could never satisfy every audience, this did a fantastic job. So glad it gave a final nod to a more holistic view of the Jedi and the previously established lore. The main characters are amazing and the portrayals so well acted. I couldn’t have hoped for more, and didn’t mind the homage to the fans— why wouldn’t a film give its fans a service at the end of a 9 part series? Well done, JJ.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:24:40.594Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:24:40.594Z","user":{"userId":"260343708","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260343708"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I got exactly what I’d hoped from Abrams: Not an extremely well crafted film, but absolutely a fitting farewell to the characters we’ve loved for over four decades.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:24:38.154Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:24:38.154Z","user":{"userId":"850775770","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/850775770"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"One movie with many movies in it.
