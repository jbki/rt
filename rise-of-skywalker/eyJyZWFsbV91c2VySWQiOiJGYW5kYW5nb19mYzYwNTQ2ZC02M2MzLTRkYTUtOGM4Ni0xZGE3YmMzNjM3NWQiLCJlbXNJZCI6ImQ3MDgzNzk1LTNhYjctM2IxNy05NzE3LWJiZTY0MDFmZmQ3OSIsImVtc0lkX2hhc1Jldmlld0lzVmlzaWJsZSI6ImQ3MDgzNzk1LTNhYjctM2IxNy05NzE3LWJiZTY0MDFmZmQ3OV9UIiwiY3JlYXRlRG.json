While I was not a fan of the ending, I can see why the writers made the decisions they did, also keeping in mind that the script had to change drastically due to the tragic loss of Carrie Fisher.

Wrap up wa sweetheart it with fantastic visuals, a dark theme and great twist. Brings back the original storyline and fight between light and dark. Also brings in a lot from the untold Star Wars universe. Sure youd want some to live or die but well worth the direction JJ and the team went. Very satisfying ending. Skywalker roses indeed.","displayName":"Marcin R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T16:54:07.160Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T16:54:07.160Z","user":{"userId":"b3f15765-e159-4ca7-bcb4-c8fe0512f868","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Marcin R","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"This was a movie I really wanted to like but it made so many bewildering choices.
