That's over. 40 years in the making. And did Disney/Abrams manage to finish in beauty as expected? Do I go out from the cinema with the joy of my childhood?\nNo.\nSadly this episode did not mark me. And I feel angry to be disappointed. But at the same time, it follows a form of logic since Disney decided to follow up Lucas' universe.... without Lucas.\nProbably the main and only problem of those sequels. The soul of Star Wars is not there. Abrams has no option but to renew what was done before. 40 years ago. With little creativity. The mind of Lucas being absent, Abram do his best to please us, bringing few new characters, good actors, great special effects, and getting rid of The Last Jedi.. .. But it is not enough for us to praise this work. Something is missing and the story is too messy.\nI am glad it is over. I will probably give it a second chance on Bluray, but for now... I will, l like many, try to digest what I just saw...","displayName":"Guiyome R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T18:57:24.503Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T18:57:33.313Z","user":{"userId":"972945017","realm":"RT","displayName":"Guiyome R","accountLink":"/user/id/972945017"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This movie deserves a lot of credit for giving the fans service, lots of nostalgia, all while correctimg course from TLJ screw ups and closing out the series as best possible.
