As an installment in the Skywalker saga and the greater Stars Wars universe its just another series of poor decisions showing a complete lack of imagination and fore thought. Though the movie has many of the fun little nuisances that we have come to expect from Director J.J. Abrams even those moments seem to fall limp as if the director nor the actors were full invested in it. Overall the movie was a complete uninspired disappointment.","displayName":"Amachi L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T20:01:38.387Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T20:01:38.387Z","user":{"userId":"a8cbab80-5661-4dab-977f-e50f245867a4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Amachi L","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Action packed and loved by the while family!","displayName":"JoAnne","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T20:00:15.490Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T20:00:15.490Z","user":{"userId":"63163c13-0c14-49bd-bf4e-2d35581b62d8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"JoAnne","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME","displayName":"Nicole K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:59:21.838Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:59:21.838Z","user":{"userId":"23F32DA4-4B8D-47E4-986A-B83A1D41DE7F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Nicole K","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I enjoyed the movie.
