It also had a lot of traditional Star Wars elements like unlikely good guys defeating the powerful evil and appreciated the love story too! I hate when movies eliminate any romance and this has it!  I'm also glad they kept the cool mind bending between Rey and Kylo. The beginning was a bit fix it and exposition heavy to tie in the second movie but it wasn't awful. Also I loved getting backstory for Poe and Finn more. I also liked Rey's identity reveal because it was unexpected and gave her more depth. I thought this movie showed her as more dynamic and flawed sometimes which made her more real. I used to slightly dislike her due to her being automatically good at everything. My fav of the trilogy!","displayName":"Elena S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:46:43.577Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:50:37.549Z","user":{"userId":"978460909","realm":"RT","displayName":"Elena S","accountLink":"/user/id/978460909"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The forced inclusion of one of the old characters","displayName":"Jorge A Trak","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:46:37.680Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:46:37.680Z","user":{"userId":"6780738A-5B18-4DFD-B6FA-39119CF35DBD","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jorge A Trak","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"With all the negative reviews, I went in with low expectations.

Don’t know why anyone would expect this movie to “move the story forward” or expand the universe.  It’s an ending, closure on the stories of those whom we started with.  Would I have done some things differently?  Yes, but I enjoyed it and will see it again.","displayName":"Angela","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:46:23.901Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:46:23.901Z","user":{"userId":"57B3EC07-6AF9-4753-8BFA-2C03F863367B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Angela","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Abrams to blame for overstuffed, hyperfast mess.

That said, the fan service does distract a bit, but the production team did an outstanding job of executing the finale.  However the decision to dig up the Emperor and build the ending around him is suspect at best.  If the management team had established a clear arc for the trilogy before hand it would have served the franchise so much better than this \"create the best recipe from these peculiar ingredients\" method they found themselves burdened with at the beginning of this films creation. That said, the light saber battles, the flying sequences, the scope of the finale are so well executed that the performances by the core leads are elevated to an epic finale. This trilogy, though far from perfect, had the task of transitioning from the story of Luke, Leia, Han and Chewie to the story of Rey, Finn and Poe. The former cast had to meet their end in order to finalize the transition and that was where they had to begin. I applaud their efforts and appreciate the challenges they faced. I am looking forward to watching The Rise of Skywalker again next week, but am thankful for the team that created this trilogy. It would have been a shame if the last Star Wars film ever made was Revenge of the Sith.\nLong live Star Wars and May the Force be With You.","displayName":"John H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:46:04.224Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:46:08.872Z","user":{"userId":"904362166","realm":"RT","displayName":"John H","accountLink":"/user/id/904362166"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This is a disgrace to the star wars lore.","displayName":"William D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2415632461893489/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:45:45.897Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T15:43:34.085Z","user":{"userId":"978455927","realm":"RT","displayName":"William D","accountLink":"/user/id/978455927"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"too many action scenes, not enough story development","displayName":"Lindsay M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:45:21.689Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:45:21.689Z","user":{"userId":"944D2947-82CB-439E-AD17-6A8A37B25C84","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Lindsay M","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A bit OTT in places, but a creative, dramatic and satisfying end to it all.","displayName":"Angus S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1105925986/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:45:14.020Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:48:37.332Z","user":{"userId":"920177430","realm":"RT","displayName":"Angus S","accountLink":"/user/id/920177430"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"}]}
