No. Could you cut out 30 mims and have no impact on the final product? Yes. Is virtually everything improbable and unnecessary? Absolutely. Despite all the negative, was it still a ton of fun? Hell yeah it was!  Its a fantasy adventure movie. If you go in expecting an Oscar worthy script, you probably shouldn't be watching it. If you go wanting to see stuff look great and blow up, then this movie is for you. The script is HORRIBLE, but overall the film is a fun ride, ties up lose ends, and give fond farewells.","displayName":"Jay S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/880600037/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-31T06:50:21.513Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T06:50:33.619Z","user":{"userId":"868282034","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jay S","accountLink":"/user/id/868282034"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"was a utter roller coaster so glad this franchise ended well for all.","displayName":"qikdip","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T06:50:00.119Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T06:50:00.119Z","user":{"userId":"73EBB1B1-1293-422B-87D2-81D04E2DBC45","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"qikdip","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Hard to fix what The Last Jedi did, however, the music was amazing!","displayName":"Ivan R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10211878104081154/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T06:47:06.381Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T06:47:09.901Z","user":{"userId":"976664135","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ivan R","accountLink":"/user/id/976664135"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"As a long time Star Wars fanatic, I thought this wrapped up the Skywalker Saga really well.  I think it addressed both minor and major plot lines in a satisfying way.  It also corrected and redeemed some of the character and canon arcs that the Last Jedi weirdly positioned. Although itâ€™s not a perfect Star Wars movie, it is a good one, and a very nice and respectful end to a 40 year story.","displayName":"Joseph","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T06:47:04.646Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T06:47:04.646Z","user":{"userId":"FE693590-A2E5-4ACB-90C5-90E288665C4C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joseph","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"this chapter of the story brings together many missing pieces for those that saw the original Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope in 1977...I was stuck to my seat from beginning to end...May the Force Always be with You...","displayName":"Jerry M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T06:45:01.732Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T06:45:01.732Z","user":{"userId":"fcecc983-5039-4bf1-8f0a-30c4cbe073b8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jerry M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Lots of twists and turns!
