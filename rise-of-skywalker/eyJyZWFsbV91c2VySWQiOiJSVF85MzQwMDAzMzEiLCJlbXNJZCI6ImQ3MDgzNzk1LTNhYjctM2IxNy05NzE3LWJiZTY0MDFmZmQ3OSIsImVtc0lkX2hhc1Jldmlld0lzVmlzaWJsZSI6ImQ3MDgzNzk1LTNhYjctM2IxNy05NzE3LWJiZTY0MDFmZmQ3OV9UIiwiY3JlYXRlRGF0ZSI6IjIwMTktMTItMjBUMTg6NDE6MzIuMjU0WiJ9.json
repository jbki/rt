It clearly hated The Last Jedi and went beyond the realm of sanity to undo as much as they could and scrap together half baked backstories and explanations that they thought would please their most misogynistic and racist \"fans\". It was beautiful to watch but the plot was truly awful. It's really incredible they made something this terrible with that many resources.","displayName":"Miles O","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1810419665/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T18:41:30.231Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T18:41:30.231Z","user":{"userId":"967503172","realm":"RT","displayName":"Miles O","accountLink":"/user/id/967503172"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Don't listen to the critics, it was amazing.
