As many have said, if you didnt like the last Jedi, youll like this. That being said, between weird plot choices, lackluster light saber battles and other issues, the movie was held back from being truly great. I wish they kept one writer/director for the whole trilogy. Woulda made a difference in my opinion.","displayName":"Dakota","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:08:40.086Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:08:40.086Z","user":{"userId":"3baafaf8-1cbd-4a87-b80a-0e9e2aad235b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dakota","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Being a Star Wars fan my whole life and being deeply invested in the EU I REALLY have not liked a lot of the stuff disney has done.  That said this movie was actually very enjoyable for me and my friends, and it gave Rey and Poe a lot of needed character building.  And it made sense!  So now Rey isn't so much a Mary Sue and Poe is no longer a random storyless background guy of sorts.\n\nAll in all I will always love 1-6 +EU (Aka Legends) more than Disney's cannon, but I must say I do recommend this movie as it is quite a good watch.","displayName":"Jared T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:08:30.039Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:08:30.039Z","user":{"userId":"978466099","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jared T","accountLink":"/user/id/978466099"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"This made me like the last Jedi more as it gave more context to some of the choices. A little rushed pacing wise but I get it’s because of how much they needed to cover. I just wish they made a few more scenes that focused on the connections between characters. A couple moments that didn’t fit for me but overall it’s a movie that I had fun watching and would recommend.","displayName":"Angelo","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:08:22.342Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:08:22.342Z","user":{"userId":"FF8B3D90-9879-4759-BD89-B18EDDD88104","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Angelo","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie from the trilogy I loved it!!!","displayName":"Rodrigo E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1170109043198920/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:08:20.095Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:08:32.565Z","user":{"userId":"978466121","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rodrigo E","accountLink":"/user/id/978466121"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"I liked how they ended the movie, disliked the journey they took getting there.

However, while still appreciating Star Trek – particularly the Kirk, Spock and McCoy relationship in the original series and related movies – I gradually have become much more of a Star Wars than a Star Trek fan. Why? I came to an answer only recently. In the end, Star Wars has more heart than Star Trek. And yes, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker has plenty of \"Star Wars heart.\"","displayName":"Raymond K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001531830958/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:07:39.797Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:07:48.767Z","user":{"userId":"909881159","realm":"RT","displayName":"Raymond K","accountLink":"/user/id/909881159"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"You know that person you dated but it ended amicably? They are likeable but just not for you/you for them. \n\nRise of Skywalker is like agreeing to hang out with that person. For nearly 3 hours. They spend those hours either reminding you of the good times you had years ago. Yeah, good times. Eventually it gets weird. They want \"make up\" for past perceived transgressions that you either forgot or didn't recognize at the time. Then it gets weird. They start acting DESPERATE for you to like them again. Why?! Why try SO HARD to make everyone in your orbit like you? The harder they try the more you cringe. Still, they're sweet. You get the closure you need from them/for yourself whether you needed it or not.","displayName":"JH3","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T19:07:39.743Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T19:07:39.743Z","user":{"userId":"2490de60-c4e7-41a4-bfc4-455bca54e9bb","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"JH3","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Probably my favorite of the sequel trilogy.
