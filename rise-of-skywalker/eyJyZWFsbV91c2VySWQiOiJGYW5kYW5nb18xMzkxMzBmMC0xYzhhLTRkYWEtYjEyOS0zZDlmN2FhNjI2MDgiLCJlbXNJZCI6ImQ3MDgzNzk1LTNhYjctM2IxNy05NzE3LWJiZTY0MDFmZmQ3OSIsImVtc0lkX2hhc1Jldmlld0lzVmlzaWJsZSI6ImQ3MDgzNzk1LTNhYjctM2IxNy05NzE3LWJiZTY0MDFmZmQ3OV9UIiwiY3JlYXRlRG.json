It stayed true to the original three. JJ Abrams is clearly the better director of the new movies. The story line makes sense and quickly explains how the emperor is back.

I'm a lifetime Star Wars fan! But let me tell you....If you love Star Wars, please do not listen to all those negative review. This is the first time I've felt the need to review a movie online...JJ Abrams gave a movie that I felt answered questions in such a smooth way, tied-in all 9 movies, and brought the Skywalker saga to a richly satisfying end. I walked out of the theater with this movie being my favorite of all Star Wars movies. I felt all the characters were done a true justice and given a tearful and applaud-worthy ending...","displayName":"Billy H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:21:18.154Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:21:18.154Z","user":{"userId":"9801c098-8325-4054-bc83-df3b421c8ea7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Billy H","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Things move too quickly but screenplay is great!
