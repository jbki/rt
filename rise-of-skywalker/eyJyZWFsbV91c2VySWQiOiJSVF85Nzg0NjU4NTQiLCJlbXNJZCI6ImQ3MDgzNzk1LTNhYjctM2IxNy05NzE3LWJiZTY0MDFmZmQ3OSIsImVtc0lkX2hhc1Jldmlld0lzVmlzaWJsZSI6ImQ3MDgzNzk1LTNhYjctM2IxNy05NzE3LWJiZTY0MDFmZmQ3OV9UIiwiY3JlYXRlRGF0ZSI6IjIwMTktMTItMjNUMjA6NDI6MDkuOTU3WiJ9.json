The Rise of Skywalker spent too much time worshiping princess Leia and again made a fool out of Luke. Palpatine's character was weak, uninteresting and cringe for the first time in any movie. Fynn was useless and unwatchable. The forced kiss scene between Rey and Ren was lame. I walked out of this movie very unsatisfied kinda like when you order a burger medium-rare from your favorite place but it comes out well done. Only at a burger place, you can always send it back. I can't unsee this lame movie, unfortunately.","displayName":"Gene D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1065234106/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:41:48.029Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:42:10.381Z","user":{"userId":"907152751","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gene D","accountLink":"/user/id/907152751"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"If you ever want to enjoy a a Disney's Star Wars Film just know that their is no better example of efforts than TROS although the plot is weak and the story makes no sense for a Star Wars film, this film is an interesting failure but visually stunning and fantastic but the lack of story and characters was just poor.

All this movie is, is a failed attempt by Disney to rectify what Kathleen Kennedy and Ryan Johnson did to the Star Wars franchise ,a mess of a film and a product of a room of executives who do not and will never understand the Star Wars Fandom ,a point proven by the ton of what they believed to be fan service infused into this film. This poorly produced film ties in perfectly with the other two that came before it thus concluding the end of what was a Trilogy that made Michael Bay look like a God of Cinematography and Direction.\nAll that had to be done was to create an original story that would not infringe and break the story we allready loved ,but somehow Disney has not only managed to wreck the old Characters we loved but also the new ones that we were eager to get to know and relate to ,a result of the poor if not inexistent character development. And now just watch the meaningless unsatisfying action and things we just pulled out of a hat and dont think","displayName":" ","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1552597054/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:41:45.431Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T00:02:37.985Z","user":{"userId":"918615943","realm":"RT","displayName":" ","accountLink":"/user/id/918615943"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Disappointing.
