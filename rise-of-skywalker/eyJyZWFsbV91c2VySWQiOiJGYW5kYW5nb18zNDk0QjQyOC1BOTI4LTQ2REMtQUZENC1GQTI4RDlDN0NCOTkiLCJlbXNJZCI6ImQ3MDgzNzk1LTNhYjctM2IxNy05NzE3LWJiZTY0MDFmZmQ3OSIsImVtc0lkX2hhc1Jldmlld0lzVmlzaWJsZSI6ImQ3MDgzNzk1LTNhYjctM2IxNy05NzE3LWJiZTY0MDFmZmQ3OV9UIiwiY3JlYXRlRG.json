Great action but the plot is week and filled with holes.

Bringing Palpatine back felt a little cheap but makes sense in connection with his seducing Anikan with talk of the ability to save people from dying in Revenge of the Sith. Everything else was a blast. Very epic. Well acted and well directed. I salute the cast, crew and JJ Abrams for sticking the landing.","displayName":"Matthew D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T22:31:28.251Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T22:31:28.251Z","user":{"userId":"5D7AF2D5-EC88-4B5E-B3D0-C6195D9F8C8E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Matthew D","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great end to a series.","displayName":"Jeremy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T22:30:24.785Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T22:30:24.785Z","user":{"userId":"66968981-3470-427C-BDBA-5173C14B7CAC","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jeremy","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It cleaned up after the previous two films as well as you could expect. By far the best of the post-Disney trilogy. Visually it was fantastic, as you would expect from a Star Wars film.
