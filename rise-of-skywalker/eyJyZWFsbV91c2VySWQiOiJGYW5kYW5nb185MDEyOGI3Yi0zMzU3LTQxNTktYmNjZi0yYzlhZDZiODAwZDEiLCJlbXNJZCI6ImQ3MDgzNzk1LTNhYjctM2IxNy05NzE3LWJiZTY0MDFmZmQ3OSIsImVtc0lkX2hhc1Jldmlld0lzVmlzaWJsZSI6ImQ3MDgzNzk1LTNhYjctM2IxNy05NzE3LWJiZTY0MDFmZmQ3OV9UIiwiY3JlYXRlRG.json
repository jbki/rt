But it really surprised me ! It is by far the best Star Wars film from this Disney's trilogy ! Of course it is not perfect, but unlike what happened with the 2 previous episodes, The Rise of Skywalker brings back the feelings of watching a Star Wars movie ! If you didn't like The Last Jedi, give a chance to this new movie ! You won't regret it ! The Force be with you !","displayName":"Mateus E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1771948572940078/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T22:08:33.018Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T22:08:46.837Z","user":{"userId":"978453688","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mateus E","accountLink":"/user/id/978453688"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A perfectly satisfying end to a bumpy trilogy!

As in it officially killed my support for Star Wars and anything else Disney has its hands on. The film itself was ok up until the final battle and that was the straw that broke the camel's back. It's just not worth supporting this franchise anymore when Disney puts producers and directors in charge of something they have no love for and only care to increase profits. Lucas made it clear he didnt care when he sold it to them and if he doesn't care, then why should we?","displayName":"Caden C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T22:08:12.193Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T22:08:14.926Z","user":{"userId":"976933369","realm":"RT","displayName":"Caden C","accountLink":"/user/id/976933369"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It was pretty good movie.
