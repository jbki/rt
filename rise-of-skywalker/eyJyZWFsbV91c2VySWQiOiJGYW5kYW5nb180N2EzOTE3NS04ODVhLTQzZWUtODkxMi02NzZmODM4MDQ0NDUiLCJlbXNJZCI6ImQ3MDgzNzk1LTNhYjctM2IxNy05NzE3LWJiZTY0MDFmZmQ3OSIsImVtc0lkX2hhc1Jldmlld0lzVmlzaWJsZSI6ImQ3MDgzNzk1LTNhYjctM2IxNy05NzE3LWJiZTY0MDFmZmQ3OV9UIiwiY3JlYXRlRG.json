Although J.J Abrams was the perfect choice to reintroduce us to the Star Wars universe in the Force Awakens he was clearly the wrong directorial choice for episode IX.  The movie does have great action and visuals but the plot is very convoluted and never makes clear the point or resolves certain characters or dilemmas.  There is entirely way to much fan service in this movie.  Although fan service is not a bad thing in it on its own it has to be measured and context matters.  If anything this movie has solidified that The Last Jedi is the best of these three sequels and I appreciate even more what he was trying to do with his movie.  All in all I didn't hate the movie and there are some redeeming qualities to it however, I found that this movie was more easily digested than the previous two as it contained more empty calories.  I am going to go see it again so hopefully my perspective will change upon a repeat viewing.","displayName":"J T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1003306615/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T18:33:23.755Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:18:16.865Z","user":{"userId":"913827425","realm":"RT","displayName":"J T","accountLink":"/user/id/913827425"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I think the movie was really good.

I had low expectations after the Ryan Johnson disaster that was the last jedi, but set your mind at ease. JJ Abrams has brought star wars back from the brink.\nI know the trilogy wasn't the most original piece of cinema, but, I thought the first installment as well as the final installment of the trilogy are solid, entertaining movies.
