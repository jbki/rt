Upon seeing the movie for myself, along with my father who grew up with the original trilogy, we both agreed this surpassed our expectations tenfold. My only issues were how fast paced the first half of the film was, but considering the plot had hardly moved after episode 8, I understand why J.J. Abrams had to rush the exposition and plot forward. The film was entertaining all throughout, filled with well written humor, and had just the right amount of nostalgic fan service.","displayName":"Connor Q","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:00:39.633Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:06:16.637Z","user":{"userId":"977915899","realm":"RT","displayName":"Connor Q","accountLink":"/user/id/977915899"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"A very disappointed end to what could have been a very impactful trilogy. The Last Jedi set expectations high and laid the ground work for something extremely compelling and meaningful.
