I really loved the action, bringing back original characters, and the way General Organa's death was handled. At times it obviously was trying to do too much but as I watched it again (yes, two times so far), I felt it was complete. The saga ended well. Not amazingly but really well. I give it a 4.5 because it is Star-freaking-Wars and this final chapter was an awesome journey!","displayName":"Karyn L Wiseman","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T01:20:53.131Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T01:20:53.131Z","user":{"userId":"8ae3840b-bb27-4921-8090-9bf481074a26","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Karyn L Wiseman","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved the whole movie, the callbacks to the other movies was great, wonderful ride.
