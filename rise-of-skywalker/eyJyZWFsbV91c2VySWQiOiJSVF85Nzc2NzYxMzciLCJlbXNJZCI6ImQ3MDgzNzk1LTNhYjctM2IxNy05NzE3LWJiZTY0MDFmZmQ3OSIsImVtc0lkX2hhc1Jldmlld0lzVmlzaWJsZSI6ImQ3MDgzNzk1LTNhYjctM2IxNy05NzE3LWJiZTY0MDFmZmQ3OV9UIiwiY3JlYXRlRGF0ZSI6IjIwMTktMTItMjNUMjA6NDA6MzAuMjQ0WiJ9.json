There are dumb things like the animals storming the destroyer, there are a TON of rushed moments. The force power levels are all over the place. They spend time in extra areas that they don’t need to, and they gloss over important details. That said this FEELS LIKE STAR WARS! 8 was a massive misstep for the whole franchise. It may have been a well made movie, but it had huge plot holes, tons of dumb moments, ruined certain characters, discards things set up in 7 and doesn’t build towards a conclusion. It’s basically a stand alone movie happening in the middle of a trilogy. So 9 has to spend the first part of the movie throwing away all of the crap from 8 (like Rose, the worst character in all of Star Wars including jar jar), then set up a finale and execute it. Abrams captures the feel of Star Wars has a cool set up for the finale and executes it decently well. I felt like I was watching Star Wars and that is something 8 didn’t do at all. So as a die hard fan who grew up on it, I am willing to forgive a lot of little dumb things because overall this movie is so fun. Love it. (I wish they would remake the whole saga now going 1-6 and actually take the time and do it right, but right now I still don’t trust Disney to not ABSOLUTELY ruin Star Wars if they did that)","displayName":"Ryan W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:38:25.882Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:38:25.882Z","user":{"userId":"E6402C07-8CE8-4AF0-A893-CFC6A68950B3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ryan W","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was great ending!","displayName":"Luke H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1325881148/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:38:18.454Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:38:25.317Z","user":{"userId":"907414837","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luke H","accountLink":"/user/id/907414837"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great way to wrap it up","displayName":"Tania S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:37:59.029Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:37:59.029Z","user":{"userId":"FFC67FD1-55BF-4ACD-889A-BDEFC61D0A77","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tania S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wrapped up a legacy.","displayName":"...","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:37:48.631Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:37:48.631Z","user":{"userId":"FB93F20D-ECB6-4DF0-87D9-FFE1771D3CBE","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"...","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It definitely serves to fix the mess of the Last Jedi and is more respectful of the Star Wars universe and Jedi spirit.","displayName":"Jevhad D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/896069727118948/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:37:32.717Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:37:39.880Z","user":{"userId":"978471399","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jevhad D","accountLink":"/user/id/978471399"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Like a droid, this movie was programmed to entertain, evoke nostalgia and plant the epic cap on the saga's end based on very rigid and safe algorithms.
