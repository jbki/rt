If the answer is \"yes\" then it's a decent flick or more. \"Rise of Skywalker\" falls into the decent or more category. I'll watch it again, maybe even on the big screen. And, it is a good \"Star Wars\" movie, warts and all. But what \"Skywalker\" really, really does is beg Disney to come up with a truly dark and epic \"Palpatine\" stand alone or trilogy.

I thought to myself \"Okay the critics are wrong I'm going to like this thing.\" However, all my predictions came true. Everything from TLJ was retconned. But who the hell cares? I hated everything from that movie anyway. \n\nNevertheless, the damage done by Rian Johnson in TLJ was irreparable. In addition, LucasFilm's lack of artistic vision was on full display. There was NEVER a plan for a coherent trilogy.\n\nIn comparison, how could Kevin Fiege craft a coherent throughline over 23 MCU films? Yet Kathleen Kennedy couldn't craft a coherent vision in 3?\n\nWhile the film had competent set-pieces the story was cobbled together. Furthermore, the list of things the Force could do became as long and as incredulous as the powers of the Golden Age Superman. Telekinesis, force lightning, precognition, limited flight, telepathy, astral projection, and now resurrection? Give me a break.\n\nThat being said it was s decent recovery from Rian Johnson's hack job. If this were a lesser franchise I could forgive its numerous sins and overuse of both plot device and plot armor. Nevertheless, it was so bad that only a fifth of the people I was in the theater with even clapped. at the end.\n\nHere is hoping Bob Iger and the Disney company examine the successes of the MCU and apply those lessons learned to the next series of Star Wars films.","displayName":"Cleveland O","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000510565425/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-21T20:57:03.562Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T20:57:11.035Z","user":{"userId":"894533137","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cleveland O","accountLink":"/user/id/894533137"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie screw the critics and trolls.
