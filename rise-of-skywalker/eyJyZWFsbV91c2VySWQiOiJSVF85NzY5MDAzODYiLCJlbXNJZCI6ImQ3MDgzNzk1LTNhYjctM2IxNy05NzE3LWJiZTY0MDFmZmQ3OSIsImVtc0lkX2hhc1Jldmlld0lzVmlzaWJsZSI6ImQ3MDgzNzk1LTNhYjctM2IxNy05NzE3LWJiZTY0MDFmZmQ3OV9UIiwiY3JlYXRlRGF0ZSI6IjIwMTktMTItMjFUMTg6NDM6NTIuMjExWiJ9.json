No connection between old characters and new. I did not believe at any time that any of the characters were in any danger, because the movie played it super safe. Preposterous things fly by at light speed. You didn't like the force being used to float a few meters through space, or project a hologram? This movie goes far beyond that. Didn't like the ending of a major character last time? Here's something 10x more pointless. An adequate ending to the series though.","displayName":"Jeff A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:42:14.680Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:42:28.779Z","user":{"userId":"978460315","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeff A","accountLink":"/user/id/978460315"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"}]}
