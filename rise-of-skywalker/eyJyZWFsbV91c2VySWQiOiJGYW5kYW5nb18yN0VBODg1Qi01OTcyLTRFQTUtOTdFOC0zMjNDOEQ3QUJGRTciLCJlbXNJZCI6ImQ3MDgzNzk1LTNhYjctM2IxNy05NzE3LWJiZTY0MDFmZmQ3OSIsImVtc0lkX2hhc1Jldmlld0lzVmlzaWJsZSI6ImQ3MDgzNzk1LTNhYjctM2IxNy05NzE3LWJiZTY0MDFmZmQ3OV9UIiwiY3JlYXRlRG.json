But when it is seen as an individual film, it is breathtaking. The action is so gripping, I could feel my heart rapidly beating against my chest. The end is satisfying, in one word, it is simply satisfying. Although I cannot bring myself to believe that the Star Wars saga, or at least the Skywalker saga, has ended, but if this had to be the end, there is not a better film than The Rise of Skywalker.","displayName":"Rodrigo F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T03:38:22.662Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T03:38:35.607Z","user":{"userId":"978386763","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rodrigo F","accountLink":"/user/id/978386763"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It started out a little slow but picked up the pace.
