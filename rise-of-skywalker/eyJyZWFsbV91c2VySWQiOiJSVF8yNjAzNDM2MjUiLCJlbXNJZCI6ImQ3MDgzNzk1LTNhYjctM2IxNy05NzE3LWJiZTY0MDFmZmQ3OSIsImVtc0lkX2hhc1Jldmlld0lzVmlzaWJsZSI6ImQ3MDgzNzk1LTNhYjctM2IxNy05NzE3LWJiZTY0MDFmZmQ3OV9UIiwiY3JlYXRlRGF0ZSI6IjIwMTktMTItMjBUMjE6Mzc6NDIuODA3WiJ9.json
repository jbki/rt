However, too much cringey explaining and too many pointless subplots and too many extra characters we never wanted. Movie is best when focused on Rey, Poe and Finn with Kylo Ren as their antagonist. I loved their scenes together! \nFeels like this needed a stronger editor or more time to pare down the clunky subplots and get more artistic takes.\nNevertheless, it was often enjoyable, more so than the boring dramas the critics seem to love. Not good enough to be must see in theaters. This can wait for streaming at home.","displayName":"Carol H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:37:42.688Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:37:48.819Z","user":{"userId":"976438509","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carol H","accountLink":"/user/id/976438509"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I was born in 69.

I would give this movie zero stars if I could. The 1st half star is only for the cameos that were sprinkled in through out and the 2nd half star was for the special effects. \n\nThe movie as a whole was one of the worst pieces of garbage I have ever seen. It was entirely rushed just to get to the ending they gave. They honestly could have split it up into two separate movies to kid of build on the ending, but it is hard to polish a turd! Please explain how Anakin's light saber was back if they destroyed it in TLJ?! I mean they completely ripped it in half!!!! Then there was all of a sudden a lightsaber of Leia's that magically appeared. Not to mention there was no mention of Luke's Green Lightsaber that he made in ROTJ and appeared in flashbacks of TLJ. Even when he fought Kylo at the end of TLJ he had Anakin's saber even though it was destroyed and he knew he didn't have it because Rey left with it. This saga by JJ Abrams was a total crap show and I for one will never consider it canon! I saw ROTJ when it was first in theater and was in complete AWE of what George Lucas had created, but even Jar Jar would be saying, \"WTF?!\" If he was to watch this pile of garbage!!!!","displayName":"S D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1031208955/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:37:06.562Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:37:14.392Z","user":{"userId":"877788137","realm":"RT","displayName":"S D","accountLink":"/user/id/877788137"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"As a long-time fan of the entire Star Wars franchise including games and tv shows, this movie did the saga justice.

This film is almost as good as it could after Rians failure with The Last Jedi. A little too fast and stressful the first 30 minutes and lot's of over-the-top use of the force. Still lots of great moments you should not miss in the cinemas. I would actually love to see these characters come back with better manuscripts now. Thank you JJ for doing your best, I truly regret you could not work on The Last Jedi and make the trilogy less wounded.","displayName":"Magnus L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10158008948982148/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:36:31.141Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:36:38.581Z","user":{"userId":"978453442","realm":"RT","displayName":"Magnus L","accountLink":"/user/id/978453442"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
