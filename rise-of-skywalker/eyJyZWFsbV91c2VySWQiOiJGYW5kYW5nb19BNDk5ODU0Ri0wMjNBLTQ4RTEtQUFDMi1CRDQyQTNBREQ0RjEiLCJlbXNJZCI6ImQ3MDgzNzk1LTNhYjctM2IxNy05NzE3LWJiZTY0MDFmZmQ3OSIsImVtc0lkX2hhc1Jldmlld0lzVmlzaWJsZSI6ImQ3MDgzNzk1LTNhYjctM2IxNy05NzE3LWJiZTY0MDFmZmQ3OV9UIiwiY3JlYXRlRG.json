The second half was amazing and could have used more time.

The critics absolutely have it wrong, and those audience members who are being critical seem to have lost their child-like wonder that is so very necessary for an adult when watching a Star Wars film. The story for \"The Last Jedi,\" but \"The Rise of Skywalker\" makes up for it. The Emperor returns, and most of the questions we've had since \"The Force Awakens\" are answered in this film, although in unexpected ways. I have only one personal beef, but it is somewhat of a spoiler, so please stop reading here if you don't want a spoiler...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nFor years a rumor had made the rounds that the deceased Jedi (Anakin, Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Luke, etc...) would make an appearance as force ghosts, but instead we only get their voice. This was an unfortunate choice to myself and my companions. Other than that the film was a solid 8 1/2 out of 10, consistent with the current audience rating.","displayName":"Eric P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:59:47.841Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:59:51.050Z","user":{"userId":"977182385","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eric P","accountLink":"/user/id/977182385"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"}]}
