The interrelationship between Ren and Rey was not adequately developed and resolved. A missed opportunity. \n\nRen and Rey represent the introduction of a new generation to the Star Wars saga.  The central themes of the Star Wars story-line became increasingly vague over the last three movies. I would have like to see Ren express wonderment as she learned about the \"Force\" and her capabilities.\n\nWell, my wife did not fall asleep at the movie theater. She usually does when we go out to a Star Wars movie. So she found it reasonably interesting.","displayName":"Steve R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T20:43:32.345Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T20:43:39.105Z","user":{"userId":"975854129","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steve R","accountLink":"/user/id/975854129"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A really solid, fan-service ending to the Skywalker saga.

The story is \"find this specific object\" or \"find this specific person,\" the sort of plot you'd find in a video game. I felt that the moral resolution of Episode 6 is undermined by Palpatine's return, but granted that he is to come back, it would have been less ad hoc to do so in Episode 8. However, this is what happens when you create a trilogy without starting with a coherent plan for all three movies from the very beginning.","displayName":"John H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/737393409/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T20:39:38.400Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T20:39:45.396Z","user":{"userId":"916730879","realm":"RT","displayName":"John H","accountLink":"/user/id/916730879"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Full of plot holes and ridiculous moments.  Ruins so much star wars lore just for the sake of \"cool\" or fan fiction moments.  It's like they didn't review the material of even the force awakens or the last Jedi when making this, as it contradicts so much.  It's incredibly predictable and uses every deus ex machina in the book.\n\nAs a stand-a-lone movie it would be alright, but in the context of the over all lore, it breaks everything.","displayName":"Andrew M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002943451513/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T20:39:24.341Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T10:16:01.593Z","user":{"userId":"947553783","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew M","accountLink":"/user/id/947553783"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved the movie, hate that it ended the way it did!","displayName":"Slyfox","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T20:39:00.730Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T20:39:00.730Z","user":{"userId":"32559A8E-39F0-412C-AAC4-E467DB53191C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Slyfox","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved this movie!
