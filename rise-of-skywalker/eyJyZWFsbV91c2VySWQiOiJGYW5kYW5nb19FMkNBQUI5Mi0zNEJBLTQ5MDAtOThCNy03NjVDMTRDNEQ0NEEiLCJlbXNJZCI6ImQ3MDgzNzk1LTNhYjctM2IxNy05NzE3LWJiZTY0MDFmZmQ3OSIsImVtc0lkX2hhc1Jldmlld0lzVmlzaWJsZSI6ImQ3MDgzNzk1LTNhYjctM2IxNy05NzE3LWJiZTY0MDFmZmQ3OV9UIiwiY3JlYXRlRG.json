JJ.. you sweet son of a bitch. you managed to make it all work. and it was such a good ending. it felt so right. made the mess you had to fix feel like a good story throughout. -SPOILERS-!!!!!!!\n..... watching Palpatine hover on the giant robotic arm was magic incarnate...  from near disaster, to full redemption. finally. a great star wars movie.","displayName":"Walt W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1032290903/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-24T07:29:28.281Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T07:29:36.254Z","user":{"userId":"918867744","realm":"RT","displayName":"Walt W","accountLink":"/user/id/918867744"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"I admit my fanboy-ism will make for a very biased review, I personally did not enjoy it very much. The plot and it's elements including it's twist involving one of it's main characters makes little to no sense. Aside from one or two fight scenes, not a fan of this one. I feel we need to reboot this trilogy and start from after episode 6 again, but that's just my opinion.","displayName":"Bradley  V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T07:29:00.449Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T07:29:28.363Z","user":{"userId":"978473337","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bradley  V","accountLink":"/user/id/978473337"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good closure to the saga","displayName":"Jose V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T07:29:00.347Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T07:29:00.347Z","user":{"userId":"7a16e183-80e3-4958-aaf0-147020873955","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jose V","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It has everything!!!
