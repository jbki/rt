That's not to say he didn't try and fix some of the mistakes of the previous film, but his idea of fixing only left me with more questions than answers, and fan service that was anything but. All of this piled on top of the most contrived fetch quest riddled with shallow characters from previous films, and new ones just as half baked. What's even more interesting is how this movie could just as well serve as a standalone. Very few things from the previous films serve the plot of this movie. The whole trilogy is so loosely held together, and TRoS broke what strings remained.

It course corrects many of the issues I had with the prior 2 films (Boyega doesn't overact like he did in TFA, no pointless subplots or uncharacteristic actions like in TLJ) but has some big flaws of its own.  I liked the brisk pace (no slow chases like in TLJ) but the story is now crammed with characters (new droid is funny but pointless) which takes away badly needed time from primary characters (Palpatine) and seems rushed.  The most egregious flaw is the ending which renders the arc of Luke/Anakin essentially useless and will forever be the death knell for the loyal fanbase.","displayName":"Craig O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:24:12.479Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:24:15.256Z","user":{"userId":"978452631","realm":"RT","displayName":"Craig O","accountLink":"/user/id/978452631"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
