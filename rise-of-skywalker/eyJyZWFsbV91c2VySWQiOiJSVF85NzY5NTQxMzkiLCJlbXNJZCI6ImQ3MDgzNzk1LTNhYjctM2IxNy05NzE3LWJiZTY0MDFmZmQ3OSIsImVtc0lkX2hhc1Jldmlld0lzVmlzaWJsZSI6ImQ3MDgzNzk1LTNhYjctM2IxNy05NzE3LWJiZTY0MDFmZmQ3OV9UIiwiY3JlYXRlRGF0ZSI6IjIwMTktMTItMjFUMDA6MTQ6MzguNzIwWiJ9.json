There were a few flaws (don't want to spoil it for anyone so keeping this vague), but they were not big enough for me to dislike the movie. Will see it in the theater a couple more times & we will be purchasing the DVD when it is released.  Would be interested in a stand alone movie with the back story of Rey's parents that ends with them leaving her where they do.","displayName":"Carolyn M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T00:14:11.914Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T00:15:22.153Z","user":{"userId":"5e0590a0-7403-40dc-9a4b-6397e7a7a6e5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Carolyn M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A great ending to the Skywalker saga","displayName":"Rubn C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002339191070/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T00:13:37.564Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T00:13:48.766Z","user":{"userId":"932615118","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rubn C","accountLink":"/user/id/932615118"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"A disappointing conclusion to a disappointing trilogy.
