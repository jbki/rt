You cant!  But this film answers questions, brings excitement, nostalgia, and an epic soundtrack to fans of a life-defining saga. It was everything I wanted and hoped for!  I didnt want new and innovative I wanted the look and feel that made me feel something, and this delivered!  The last 45 minutes (and last 5 minutes) left me with goosebumps and left me feeling completely satisfied about the way J.J. Abrams chose to finish this story. I wondered what the film title meant for months, and Im happy that I now know and that all of my guesses werent anything close!  A fitting finale. Dont be deterred by the negative if youre a fan of the series.","displayName":"Ryan C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:42:10.856Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:42:10.856Z","user":{"userId":"e7185b06-da88-4ff9-a114-d05b33f76768","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ryan C","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Perfect ending to the saga and trilogy!

It had a great balance of fan service, new ideas, action and humor. It righted the ship from Last Jedi, which I thought was ok but not the direction the story should've went.  I find it hilarious that the critics are putting this one down for pretty much the same reasons they hailed Force Awakens, but that's critics for you.","displayName":"mike l","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:41:18.869Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:41:32.860Z","user":{"userId":"901306998","realm":"RT","displayName":"mike l","accountLink":"/user/id/901306998"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I really enjoyed this movie!
