Trying desperately to create a new and interesting plot while stuffing itself with unnecessary subplots and characters. The movie utterly failed to grab my attention or create any feeling besides annoyance. At times it feels like the movie is trying to redeem itself but the vast majority of the time it just doesn't seem to care. It holds no respect for any of the material that came before and contains no memorable moments. A sad end to a waning franchise.","displayName":"Kyle K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T17:10:47.544Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T17:10:56.917Z","user":{"userId":"978081134","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kyle K","accountLink":"/user/id/978081134"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"}]}
