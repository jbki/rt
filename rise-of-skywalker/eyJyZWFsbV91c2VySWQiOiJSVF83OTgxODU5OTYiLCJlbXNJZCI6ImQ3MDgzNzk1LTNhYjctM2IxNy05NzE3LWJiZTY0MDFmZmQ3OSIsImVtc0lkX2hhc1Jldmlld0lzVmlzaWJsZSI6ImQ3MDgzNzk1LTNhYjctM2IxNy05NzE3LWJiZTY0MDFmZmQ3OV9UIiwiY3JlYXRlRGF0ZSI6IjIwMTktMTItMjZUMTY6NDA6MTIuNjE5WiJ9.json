Heredity is everything. How we live is nothing. Nobody can rise above those born into power. The Skywalker family remains subservient to the Palpatine family and pays the ultimate price. The Palpatine bloodline line carries on. Nobody ever mattered more than them. That’s the result. All for nought, a galaxy free for now, as long as there isn’t a flip of the evil switch. And now, there are no Skywalkers left to protect the galaxy, and nobody else can do it because they weren’t born into it. With a quick bait and switch, we find out this was a Palpatine story all along.

I enjoyed the most the scene when they are on the field and the huge waves behind, maybe because it looked similar to the place where I live. Palpatine was awesome: i think he played for the whole team: his attitude and his well chosen words transformed his role into something Extraterrestrial; he was phenomenal. I also have nice words for the other actors and the whole crew there. I would have given 10 but , gave it only 9 because of the fast , too close and too far filming , not seeing too much of the surrounding like in Rogue One for example.) but as a whole , the film was well built and same as the dagger helped Rey to get to that clue reaching her next goal, the same , the film itself points out clues within itself to get to that secret message to be delivered for those who have eyes to see; i think that is what art does - it delivers a message , and everybody sees it the way they want, and that is the beauty of it.","displayName":"John D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2844729785551486/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:38:35.724Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:39:01.607Z","user":{"userId":"978480261","realm":"RT","displayName":"John D","accountLink":"/user/id/978480261"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"I was not that impressed.

Personally I loved this movie, I love it so much it may actually make the first two MORE watchable for me, and thus improves the new trilogy  significantly.
