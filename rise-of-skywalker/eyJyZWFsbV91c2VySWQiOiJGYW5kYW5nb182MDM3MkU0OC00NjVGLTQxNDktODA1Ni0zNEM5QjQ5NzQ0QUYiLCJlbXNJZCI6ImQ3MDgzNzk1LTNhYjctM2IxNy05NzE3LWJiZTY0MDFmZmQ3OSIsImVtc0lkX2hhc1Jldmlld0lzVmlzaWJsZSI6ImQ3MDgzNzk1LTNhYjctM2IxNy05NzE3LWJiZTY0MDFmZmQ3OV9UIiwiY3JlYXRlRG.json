This movie broke many of the longstanding Star Wars rules like TIE fighters from episodes 4-6 were short range fighters without hyperdrives.  A Death Star that exploded into dust miraculously has large pieces in tact with windows and power.  JJ Abrams is notorious about borrowing ideas from other movies and even his TV shows.  The Rambaldi artifacts from Alias become the Wayfinder.  I was waiting to see if a ship crashed and the people in the tail section were marooned or overly-used lens flares around Rey.  The pace was too fast and solving problems was too easy.  The return of Palpatine just made little sense.  Better than VIII but still a mess.","displayName":"FH","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T15:00:52.812Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T15:00:52.812Z","user":{"userId":"cad21090-e7ac-400b-9516-d85d126c97a1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"FH","accountLink":null},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"14h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Well done!
