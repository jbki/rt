Nice blend of modern culture and good ole' Star Wars. Unlike The Last Jedi, Rise of Skywalker is a more enjoyable, and in terms of the Star Wars fanatic inside me, it left me content. Of course, there were still some questions I had, but none major to the story line. In my opinion, it's the best out of the trilogy Disney has made. I don't feel it's fair to compare it to Rogue One or Solo because those two are a lot more straightforward whereas Rise of Skywalker is A LOT to take in. Of course everyone has their own opinions and this is mine, some other fanatics don't like the movie, but personally, I thought it was great.","displayName":"Joe","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T19:03:26.005Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T19:03:26.005Z","user":{"userId":"73cc0e38-1e48-4636-9410-915f9182f53f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joe","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"}]}
