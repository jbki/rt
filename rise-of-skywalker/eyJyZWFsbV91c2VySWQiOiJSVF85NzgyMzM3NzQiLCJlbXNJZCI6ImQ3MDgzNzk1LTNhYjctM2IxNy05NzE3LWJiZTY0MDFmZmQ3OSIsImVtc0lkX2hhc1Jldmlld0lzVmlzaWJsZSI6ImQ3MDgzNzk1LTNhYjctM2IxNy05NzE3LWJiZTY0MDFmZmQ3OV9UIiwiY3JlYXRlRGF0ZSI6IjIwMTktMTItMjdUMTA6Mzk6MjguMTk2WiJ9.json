But to the contrary I left the theatre wanting to see it again. I get the complaints, it isn’t perfect, but it’s for sure not the worst of the 9, nor even the current trilogy. It achieves the difficult task of fixing the previous film’s mess while also coming full circle with themes established in prequels and original trilogy. Is there fan service or a reversal of some poor choices made by Rian Johnson? Sure... but is that a bad thing?","displayName":"jeff","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T10:25:44.138Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T10:25:44.138Z","user":{"userId":"6FC6DC6A-A98A-46CD-A020-5A7E7666B393","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"jeff","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Too chaotic.
