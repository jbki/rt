It is like they wrote the three newest trilogy scripts completely separate from each other with no thought about the previous movies.\n\nYou sort of had to just buy into the fact that 1 or 2 movies (that didnt get made) happened in between episode 8+9 and just be fine that the characters could do things no other force users have ever done before in the franchise.

Play on the safe side, lots of fan service thrown around. The last trilogy was a completely missed opportunity to enhance the original universe and story.

I did enjoy a few things, like Rae's lineage. I told a friend I went to see it and they asked me how I liked it. My response was this: \"I put movies in 2 categories: 1) I'd pay full price to see it., or 2) I'll see it at 'Matinee'. I paid full price to see this, but should have seen it at 'Matinee'\" was my response to this friend.","displayName":"Disappointed Jedi Knight","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T14:09:46.230Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T14:09:46.230Z","user":{"userId":"e2ec1fc7-6c59-4ab1-a1e6-3a4510a534fe","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Disappointed Jedi Knight","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"15h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"The Rise of Skywalker was a messy, fan-service conclusion to the Sequel Trilogy that tries too hard to evoke emotion.  Despite Disney declaring the Expanded Universe/Legends content non-canon, this movie borrowed heavily from it to tie up all the loose ends left over from poor story writing in Ep. 7 and 8.\n\nThe story takes place on 7 different planets in 125 minutes.  That's roughly 17 minutes at each location.  And due in part to covering all this ground this fast, the plot is razor thin most of the time.\n\nOf course the effects, action scenes and score were superb.  And the acting was decent.  That's really what redeems it.  But the flow of the movie was lightning fast, and the movie suffered from it.  This really should have been 2 separate 2 hour films.\n\nWalking out of the theater, I felt almost nothing.  Ultimately, it's just a popcorn munching forgettable film.  I'm just glad the sequel trilogy is over at this point.","displayName":"Michael S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T14:09:03.325Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T14:09:03.325Z","user":{"userId":"fcd92cac-faf8-4539-8a3a-d21c84e6940b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael S","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"15h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I thought it turned around the absolute mess of the previous movie. I don't know how the film managed it in so little time, so much damage to correct. It went back to the big, universal themes of love and friendship and betrayal and good and evil and redemption. Not some kind of political correctness mouthpiece like the previous film. And which will ultimately really date The Last Jedi. This film felt like a continuation of the original three Star Wars films to me.","displayName":"Isabel A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/529470234092286/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T14:08:57.647Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T14:09:09.817Z","user":{"userId":"976961327","realm":"RT","displayName":"Isabel A","accountLink":"/user/id/976961327"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"15h ago"}]}
