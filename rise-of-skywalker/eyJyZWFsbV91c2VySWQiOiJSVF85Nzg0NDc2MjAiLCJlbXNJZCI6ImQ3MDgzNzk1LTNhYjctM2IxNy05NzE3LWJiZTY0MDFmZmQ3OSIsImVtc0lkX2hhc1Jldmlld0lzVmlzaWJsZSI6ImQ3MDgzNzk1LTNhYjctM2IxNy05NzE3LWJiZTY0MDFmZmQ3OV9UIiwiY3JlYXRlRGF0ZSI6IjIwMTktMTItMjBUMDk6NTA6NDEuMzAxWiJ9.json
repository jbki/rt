But the plot is absolutely atrocious.  \n\nThis movie struggles to maintain any relevance for characters suggested to be important in the first movie of this latest trilogy and any form of meaningful character development is neglected. This movie fails to stand alone or support its previous films in any meaningful way and casts a terrible stain on the Star Wars brand. \n\nI hope that Disney takes careful consideration in how they continue to produce content for the Star Wars franchise so as to maintain its value and rich history.","displayName":"Matthew Z","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/4257012361552/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T09:15:38.884Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:02:51.050Z","user":{"userId":"978384172","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew Z","accountLink":"/user/id/978384172"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"A movie is supposed to have a vision. The Original Trilogy had a vision. The Prequel Trilogy had a vision. \"The Force Awakens\" and \"The Last Jedi\" had a vision, even though they differed from each other. This movie has no vision, it feels like a corporate product, created from fan fictions on the internet. Highlights were really sparse in this. The movie feels empty, I felt nearly no emotions while watching it. It tries so hard to satisfy its audience, that it becomes bland and doesnâ€˜t do anything new or interesting to discuss.","displayName":"Adamantium L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T09:10:17.727Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T22:10:56.799Z","user":{"userId":"976929701","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adamantium L","accountLink":"/user/id/976929701"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It a very watchable standalone film in the series i guess. but as a trilogy.. its all over the place.","displayName":"K G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T08:59:12.015Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T04:53:14.633Z","user":{"userId":"976667677","realm":"RT","displayName":"K G","accountLink":"/user/id/976667677"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Just go and enjoy a star wars movie.

The movie pry's for your nostalgia by playing music from previous films and references to old and new characters.
