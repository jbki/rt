Without spoiling it, \"The Rise of Skywalker\" feels like watching a chef overcook a salmon with oils bursting and popping from the pan onto the chef's skin and then onto us: the audience. For a Star Wars fan, it's disappointing and even insulting by Star Wars lore and by what's in \"Force Awakens\" and \"The Last Jedi\", proving that nothing was ever truly envisioned and/or planned from the \"Force Awakens\" onward. For a casual watcher, while visually pleasing, it is more of the style of \"Fast & Furious\" and - by being a trilogy - is notably inconsistent with past entries: being \"Force Awakens\" and \"The Last Jedi\". Therefore, a film for the brainless watching activity rather than for a film enthusiast. With its twists and MacGuffins constantly breaking even their own rules of logic, \"The Rise of Skywalker\" cannot be recommended for a true film enthusiast as it leaves a burnt and stale taste in the mouth that is only worsened if one had watched the past entries, and - at the same time - worsens memories of those past entries, which in itself is an astonishingly bad accomplishment. However, for the mindless looking for fun, I believe that there is a fun time to be had with no active thinking at all in \"The Rise of Skywalker\" - despite its horrible action sequences: \"The Rise of Skywalker\" is still a significantly high budget movie and is both visually and audibly pleasing.","displayName":"Neill B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T07:48:30.531Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T07:48:36.543Z","user":{"userId":"977139558","realm":"RT","displayName":"Neill B","accountLink":"/user/id/977139558"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Somewhat convoluted plot that introduces far too many things in this last instalment due to The Last Jedi subverting everything The Force Awakens set up and doing nothing to further the intrigue. However, once you look past that, The Rise of Skywalker is a very enjoyable film that manages to successfully land the ending and close the saga in a satisfying manner. This is by far not a perfect movie, but given that the previous film had set up nothing to resolve, this is as best of an outcome as one could have hoped.","displayName":"Chris T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T07:47:51.443Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T07:48:07.171Z","user":{"userId":"974461825","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris T","accountLink":"/user/id/974461825"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"after 42 yrs. a saga truly has an ending , awesome story telling ,direction ,acting. i am so satisfied of the outcome of this masterpiece.","displayName":"al","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T07:46:49.384Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T07:46:49.384Z","user":{"userId":"76b584a0-58ec-42cd-bcde-41e74c09670a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"al","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Much better than I expected after that last Jedi dumpster ðŸ”¥. The pacing wasnâ€™t great and the final battle could have been better but no big failures. The story easily could have been a trilogy in itself. Overall, I enjoyed the film.

There were some truly excellent parts -- all associated with Kylo Ren/Ben Solo's character. But it felt like Star Wars-meets-Lord of the Rings-meets- Avengers: Endgame all rolled up into one. There were parts that felt forced, especially the ending sequence. It didn't feel very believable.

I wish these movies didn't rely so heavily on the fetch-quests so much. It makes for a good video game trope, but I don't feel Star Wars needs it so much. \n\nLoved all the new characters and the reveals, but felt bad for Rose being put out on the back burner and only having a few not important moments in the film. \n\nI'd recommend this and welcome it to my library once it becomes available for purchase.","displayName":"Matt J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10221231615488536/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T07:39:32.639Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T07:39:46.940Z","user":{"userId":"978473390","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt J","accountLink":"/user/id/978473390"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It's worth a watch.
