Amazing how such a vast universe in the wrong hands has turned into something generic and lifeless. In an almost desperate attempt to please the 'fans' and undo the construction of the previous movie, JJ Abrams cowardly drives the movie into the comfort zone all the time, always trapped in the Manichean and nostalgic feeling of the old movies, without delving deeper or daring in no situation. A rotten script that presents equally obvious situations and resolutions, such that there is no room even for its (charismatic) characters to shine. In essence it is a movie to be forgotten in all respects (yes, not even the thousand nostalgic scenes have the impact they should) solely made to fulfill the table and generate a few more millions for the mouse company, congratulations.\n\nNote: two stars in consideration to the cast that I have very affection. Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Issac, Carrie Fisher, thanks for trying so hard to do a good job, you deserved more","displayName":"Otvio F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:34:25.029Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:34:32.468Z","user":{"userId":"978441885","realm":"RT","displayName":"Otvio F","accountLink":"/user/id/978441885"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Absolute mess of a movie.","displayName":"Pedro Vitor Z","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:34:13.924Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:23:53.229Z","user":{"userId":"978441941","realm":"RT","displayName":"Pedro Vitor Z","accountLink":"/user/id/978441941"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wow, i'm very happy with this sensationell ending","displayName":"Levin S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/595260001300884/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:33:59.691Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:34:08.108Z","user":{"userId":"978441930","realm":"RT","displayName":"Levin S","accountLink":"/user/id/978441930"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best ending that a star wars fan could ever wish for T.T still in tears...","displayName":"Mari S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002364285962/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:33:53.196Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:34:06.327Z","user":{"userId":"912716666","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mari S","accountLink":"/user/id/912716666"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A good movie that recovers the essence of star wars and tries to solve the disaster that Rian Johnson did with episode 8.\nVery difficult is to make 2 movies in one, explain the story and recover characters that were deformed in the last Jedi and close both the story in general and related to each character;  JJ Abrams did what he could and has had relative success.
