The last Jedi is the weakest of the new trilogy. Rise of Skywalker bring all I expect bin a star wars film, action, drama, comedy. I laughed I cried I loved it. I have seen it 4 times and I like it more each time. The nostalgia is there as well as the new.

Stormtroopers as weak as ever, plot armor as thick as ever, and despite the fast pacing and constant moving, nothing that happens in the first half of the movie is meaningful. Everything feels spontaneous, the Empire feels like a threat that just came out of nowhere and way too forced, Kylo Ren also just fails as an antihero because his role was more of a joke. I'm writing in points because if I didn't, this would turn into a 2000 word essay. 1/10 movie, I'm truly disappointed that for a movie of this caliber, with this amount of budget, it couldn't have better writing and better dialogues. What we want to see is epic space battles, intense lightsaber battles. What we got was a team of characters going on a quest to find a clue that leads to the antagonist, and they visited a few planets on the way, only battling stormtroopers. The only lightsaber battle between Kylo Ren and Rey was extremely underwhelming, with the camera mostly focusing on the environment because it was obvious that their skill was equal and they were just blocking every attack. Kylo Ren seems lost the whole film, and so does Rey, which makes us the audience, also feel lost as even the main characters don't seem to know what they're doing. Kylo can't make up his mind whether to kill Rey, Rey can't make up her mind who she really is. \nWhat would have saved this movie for me, is if Palpatine dual-wielded his red lightsabers like he did in the Clone Wars, with skill that would rival Jedi Masters. Instead, lightning seems to be his only trick, and he is defeated easily by blocking the lightning with not one, but two lightsabers...? Very very underwhelming, and Finn's actions in the film just left me with even more questions. What did he actually do? What was the thing he was trying to say to Rey? If it was romance, did the writers just completely give up on it halfway? And why was the humor so dry and unfunny? \n\ntl;dr: everything felt forced, rushed, palpatine came out of nowhere, movie never had a clear objective, lightsaber battles were underwhelming, space battles almost non-existent, etc etc.","displayName":"Lucio Y","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002610174088/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T07:29:32.802Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T07:29:37.081Z","user":{"userId":"959647989","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lucio Y","accountLink":"/user/id/959647989"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Its a Star Wars Movie!

I have many, many problems with it that wouldn't pass an 8-year-old's BS test, and they start right in the opening story crawl.\n\nIt's quickly obvious that this is the \"Return of the Jedi\" copy for this trilogy as TFA and TLJ contained echoes of Episodes 4 and 5 respectively. At a distance, the movie plays like a \"race to the prize\" to keep the story moving, but up close the plot elements are pasted in haphazardly in a classic Hollywood 'all-too-convenient' manner.\n\nI will give points for what looks like an honest attempt to give justice to the passing of Ms. Fisher through the very-expected exit of Leia (although this fan knows Fisher wanted her strangled by her own bra) I do not however award any points for the overt, almost patronizing degree of fanservice that otherwise appears throughout the film.\n\nUltimately, Rise of Skywalker is a rushed 'build-up and wrap up' that leaves you unsatisfied and adds nothing smart or original to the brand. At its best, it packages up this trilogy nicely to be stowed away in a musty closet, ignored entirely by future sci-fi fans.","displayName":"Pete T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10159925089090604/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T07:26:58.033Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T07:27:04.596Z","user":{"userId":"977005086","realm":"RT","displayName":"Pete T","accountLink":"/user/id/977005086"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"}]}
