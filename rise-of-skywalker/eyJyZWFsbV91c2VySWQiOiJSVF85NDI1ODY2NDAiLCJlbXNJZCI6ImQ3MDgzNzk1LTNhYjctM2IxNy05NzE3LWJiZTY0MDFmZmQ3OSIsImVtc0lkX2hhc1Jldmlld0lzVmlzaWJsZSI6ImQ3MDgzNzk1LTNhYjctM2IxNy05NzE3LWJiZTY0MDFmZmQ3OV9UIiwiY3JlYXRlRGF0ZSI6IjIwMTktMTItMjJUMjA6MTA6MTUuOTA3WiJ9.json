Ona par with the last trilogy, in quality and visual wonder. The Film nicely closes, supposedly, the saga of the Skywalker family with nice send offs to tons of familiar faces, each one bringing a smile to my face. Much like the end of the 2nd trilogy, or is that the first, when we discover and see how Darth Vader became the man behind the mask, both physically as well as mentally, this finale gives us an ending that connects most of the dots. And for the most part does it in a crowd pleasing and enjoyable way.

I don't understand the fan excitement over thisâ€”TROS is a movie that does everything and nothing all at the same time. A nostalgia trip that somehow regresses each character, promises us things that never pan out, dupes us into thinking that anything in this trilogy was ever planned from the start, and gives our lead the short end of the stick in all aspects. The highlight of the movie was Adam Driver, no doubt putting his all into a shoddy mess of a script that he was given. J.J. Abrams was correct when he said he's really bad at wrapping up film endings.","displayName":"Gennie D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:09:52.562Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:11:35.473Z","user":{"userId":"978466375","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gennie D","accountLink":"/user/id/978466375"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Poe's character gets more and more annoying.  Everytime he speaks.  also too much predictability and not enough shock.  It had a lot to live up to.  I felt like better acting may have helped in that department.

Granted a saga that has been around for 42 years.  The Palpatine arc is a bit odd but it ties up some loose ends and creates others. This will not be the end of the franchise just the Skywalker saga.
