The only thing that let's it down is the film that came before it. The first film in the trilogy set up so many plot threads and then Rian Johnson threw it all out in the second film and did absolutely nothing with any of the characters in 2 and a half hours. I think JJ did an outstanding job considering this had to basically become the second act ASWELL as the third act AND close off the Skywalker saga! If JJ would have been in control of all 3, I think we would have three 4 and a half to 5 star films. The force awakens got a 4 and a half from me and the last jedi got a 2.","displayName":"andrew p","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T17:23:32.061Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T17:23:38.658Z","user":{"userId":"965860797","realm":"RT","displayName":"andrew p","accountLink":"/user/id/965860797"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Very satisfied with the ending of the saga as a whole.

It’s not the best Star Wars film out there but far from the worst. The movie delivers excellent special effects, action sequences, performances, and cinematography. There’s a couple problems with the story and I’m sure diehards will find some things to complain about in the pacing but it’s a well-made film with a lot of fan service.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T17:17:58.311Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T17:17:58.311Z","user":{"userId":"905459818","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/905459818"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was entertaining but kind of too long.
