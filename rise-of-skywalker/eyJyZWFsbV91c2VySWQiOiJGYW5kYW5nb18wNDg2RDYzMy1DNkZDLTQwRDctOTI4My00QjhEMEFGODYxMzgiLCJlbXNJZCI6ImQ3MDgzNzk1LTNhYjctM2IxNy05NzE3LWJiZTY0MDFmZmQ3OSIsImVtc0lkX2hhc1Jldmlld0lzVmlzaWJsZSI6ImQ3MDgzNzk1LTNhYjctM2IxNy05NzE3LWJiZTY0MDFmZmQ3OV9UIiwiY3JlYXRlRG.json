Unfortunately, in this final movie of the trilogy, it is apparent that little care was taken to make the three films mesh in a cohesive manner, and TROS suffers for it. Additionally, the ending, though suitably dramatic and flashy, seemed quite lazy and decidedly lacking in creativity. If you can overlook the inconsistencies and unadventurous writing, it is certainly an enjoyable film, though a cinematic masterpiece it is not.","displayName":"Archivist","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T01:51:51.831Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T01:51:51.831Z","user":{"userId":"70a9c991-a8d5-4894-921a-5dc07e9346c5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Archivist","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"No complaints.
