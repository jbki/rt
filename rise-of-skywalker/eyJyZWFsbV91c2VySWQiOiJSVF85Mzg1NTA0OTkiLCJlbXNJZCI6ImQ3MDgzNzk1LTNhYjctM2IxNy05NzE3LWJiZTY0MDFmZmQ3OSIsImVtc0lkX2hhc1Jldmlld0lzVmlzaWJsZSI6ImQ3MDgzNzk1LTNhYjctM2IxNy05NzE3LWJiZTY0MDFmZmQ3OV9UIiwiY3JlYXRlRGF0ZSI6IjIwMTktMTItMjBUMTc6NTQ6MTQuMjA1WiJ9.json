It was Game of Thrones Season 8 all over again. There was no character development and the writing was atrocious. This movie should have been called The Rise of Palpatine instead, because it was a Skywalker genocide to prop up a character given a Palpatine ancestry for pure shock value, which did not make any sense in the story as a whole. Rey taking the Skywalker name at the conclusion of the Star Wars saga was a slap in the face to longtime fans who entered theaters wanting to see the Skywalkers restored to their rightful place in a story that has lasted generations. \n\nThis review is based solely on the story being told and is in no way reflective of the performance of the actors and crew who poured so much of their time and talent into this movie. They were the only saving grace The Rise of Skywalker had.","displayName":"Misty Dawn S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:52:36.117Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:52:38.678Z","user":{"userId":"978450651","realm":"RT","displayName":"Misty Dawn S","accountLink":"/user/id/978450651"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved this movie, it's everything I wanted and more.","displayName":"Patrick S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/169596757729244/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:52:35.665Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:52:39.442Z","user":{"userId":"978451631","realm":"RT","displayName":"Patrick S","accountLink":"/user/id/978451631"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
