JJ Abrams absolutely fixed what Rian Johnson created for the story. There were also twists and turns that made this story fun and exciting as well as many callbacks to previous Star Wars movies and shows. Overall, fitting end to the skywalker saga.","displayName":"Sam","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T05:42:18.682Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T05:42:18.682Z","user":{"userId":"13ce3062-3e86-4c1c-be4f-0158dd4f92c8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sam","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"23h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"im not a big fan of star but I did watch the other 2 and they were better than this one.","displayName":"Armando C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T05:41:29.287Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T05:41:29.287Z","user":{"userId":"1DF78C82-4D39-43FC-9B7E-C5E153B417E3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Armando C","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"23h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I think that this movie is very entertaining and a perfect end for the characters. However it has many moments poorly grounded, placed only for the plot to work. It would have been better to make two movies with the material of this one.
