You cannot compare the older with the newer. The new trilogy is very good. There are plenty of twists and suprises to keep you interested throughout the entirety of the film. A very good send off to the Skywalker Saga. I will be buying this on DVD.","displayName":"Cris R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T20:56:11.076Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T20:56:11.076Z","user":{"userId":"65FE4307-9F06-40B1-968A-4BD596AFACB8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Cris R","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Hmm I feel like I saw this movie before, oh itâ€™s generic version of Return of the Jedi.","displayName":"William","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T20:55:16.099Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T20:55:16.099Z","user":{"userId":"AC876DF4-0540-4FAE-B88A-DE2C5673DEDA","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"William","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I am not a Star Wars junkie but I did enjoy the movie","displayName":"Terry H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T20:54:23.991Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T20:54:23.991Z","user":{"userId":"bea126e0-6c73-4a06-a6d5-264eedf20d89","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Terry H","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"At least its finished !","displayName":"Sam Y","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1588267337/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T20:53:57.302Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T20:54:03.262Z","user":{"userId":"842918600","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sam Y","accountLink":"/user/id/842918600"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good ending to saga.","displayName":"brett","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T20:51:44.554Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T20:51:44.554Z","user":{"userId":"A293BB38-153A-44C4-8A3B-0D65A316FFB9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"brett","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Loved the movie, but deserved a better ending","displayName":"Christina","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T20:50:56.192Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T20:50:56.192Z","user":{"userId":"9157f9d7-3ad0-40d1-9ceb-bead087a3f5b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Christina","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great way to wrap up a generation of Star Wars.

I created a profile on Rotten Tomatoes just to show my support for the film.  If you really wanted to, you could pick apart the plot of every Starwars movie.  But what makes the movies so awesome is the mystical,magical, fantastic adventures that these characters go on.  This movie delivers on all fronts and will always be one of my favorites.","displayName":"Chris C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2908635309188522/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T20:46:57.822Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T20:47:00.819Z","user":{"userId":"978496730","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris C","accountLink":"/user/id/978496730"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"}]}
