There were so many things wrong with it I hardly know where to start: characterization, plot, storytelling, MacGuffins, pacing, edits, and the dialogue (holy exposition, Batman!)... \n\nThe principle of \"show, don't tell\" shouldn't have to be stated about a visual format, but here we are.  At least half the time the characters are explaining what they're doing, or about to do, and nothing that we want to know about gets explained at all! Worst of all, J.J. himself, who voices D-O the droid, is literally telling the audience how to feel and ruining the few emotional experiences it even allows us to have.  That's being generous, too, because the pacing is so rapid-fire, smash-cut together that we hardly have time to feel anything, even when the actors are doing their best to emote (and they did a damn fine job with what they were given, it's just too bad they were given crap).  \n\nThere are so many plot devices, deus ex machinas, plot holes, and retcons I can't possibly catalogue them all.  It even retcons its own retcons within the same movie! \n\nChekhov's Gun? Forget it. Just more mysterybox bullsh*t from JJ the king. Hints are dropped constantly throughout the movie and never paid off.\n\nMost importantly, the spirit of Star Wars has always been about hope.  This entire movie felt like it was made out of spite, both for what Rian Johnson set up in The Last Jedi, and within the movie itself in the way the characters behaved toward one another.  (SPOILERS: Pretty much every plot point in TLJ was retconned.  The trio bickered and jabbed at one another, and most of it did not come off as friendly banter.  Finn was downright hurtful to Poe at one point.  His actions toward Hux were not very heroic either.  I got the sense that JJ did absolutely no research into the backstories already developed for any of these characters, least of all Poe, whose entire background was retconned from a former military officer into a racist caricature of a drug runner, just so that that JJ could get one of his friends in and shoehorn in some heterosexuality to break up the bromance between Finn and Poe.  Hux's death felt pointless and spiteful toward fans who had connected with the character; given his background of childhood (and lifelong) abuse, it was a rather ill-fitting message to send that he did something for the greater good and then was shot down by one of his childhood abusers.)  This is all to say nothing of the ending, which only serves to open everything back up to repeat the cycle again, rather than tying up the saga as it was supposed to do.\n\nIf JJ felt \"written into a corner\" by whatever TLJ set up, so much that he needed to waste time retconning everything that has gone before rather than just getting on with the story, then he needs to give up writing. Fan fiction writers have already given us more interesting \"fix-it\" movie plots over on Twitter.  This movie is nothing more than a stain on the legacy of Star Wars and its actors.","displayName":"Sabrina S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/599559688/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:23:24.971Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:23:29.842Z","user":{"userId":"790611219","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sabrina S","accountLink":"/user/id/790611219"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"I am a bit of a Star Wars geek, just FYI. I saw this movie yesterday and had many moments where I wanted to pull my hair out because of plot holes and broken lore. I just... I can’t fully explain what was wrong with this movie without spoiling it. Dissatisfying character arcs, unexplained character changes, super powered force wielders, and also this movie felt like it either should have been two separate movies or half of the content should’ve been deleted. There were several moments, especially toward the end, when people in the crowded theater shouted, “WHAT?!” and the rest of the theater either laughed or agreed with them. (I was one to say, “Right?!?! WHAT?!?!?”) I have loved Star Wars for my entire life, and this movie was a very unfortunate let down. I have loved these new characters, and to see basically all of them end with dissatisfying arcs and added plot holes was disappointing. Continuity is a thing which exists in reality, but apparently that wasn’t a goal for this film.","displayName":"Amy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:22:33.171Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:22:33.171Z","user":{"userId":"BD2AF72D-90E9-4C10-89AD-2EFC74D54FFF","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Amy","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved this film.
