Storylines didn't finish, introducing new unnecessary characters without a meaningful reason, the dialogues are flat, and there are several questionable choices regarding the story. The rhythm of the movie is a complete nightmare, the first hour is like a chase scene. We visit several planets, every mystery solved in a moment, zero character development happens. The movie does a lot of cheap commemoration to the old series which makes it more infuriating besides the other issues. There are several meme-worthy events also. I can forgive a lot of things about the stuff they introduced in the universe even if they are not making any sense, and there are so many basic issues with this that I won't even mention them.\nThere are 30-45 good minutes of the movie in the end which is worth watching. Which is worthy to say its a Star Wars movie. The design is amazing, the special effects are breathtaking, the sound is as good as you want from this franchise, and the actors do a good job if they are lucky to get a script/story/character to work with. It monumental, exciting, touching, its a shame that it lasts such a short time.\nOverall its a really disappointing experience. I was biased because I love the SW universe. I was even indulgent against The Last Jedi because I hoped that the last one will make us forget it. Even the prequels have a satisfying ending. JJ Abrams was the guarantee. It didn't happen. I didn't know its possible but the Rise of the Skywalker is the worst of the whole series. The ending of the whole Skywalker saga deserved a better ending.","displayName":"Mt K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3753978057949450/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:45:16.368Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:53:02.233Z","user":{"userId":"978442123","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mt K","accountLink":"/user/id/978442123"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Could've been better, but it's not a bad movie..
