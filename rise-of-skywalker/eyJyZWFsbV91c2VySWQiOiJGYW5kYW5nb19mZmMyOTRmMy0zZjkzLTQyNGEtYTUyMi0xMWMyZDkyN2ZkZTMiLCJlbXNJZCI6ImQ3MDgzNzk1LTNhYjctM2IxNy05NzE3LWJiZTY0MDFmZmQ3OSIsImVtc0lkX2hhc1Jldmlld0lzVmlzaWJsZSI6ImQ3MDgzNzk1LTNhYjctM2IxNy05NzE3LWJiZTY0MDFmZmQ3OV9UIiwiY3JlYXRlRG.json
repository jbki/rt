With the mess prior to this movie being the last Jedi, a lot was not going for this movie before it’s release. However, when I sat down to watch it, I was no bored and was engaged throughout the entire film. Don’t get me wrong this was no empire strikes back or even a similar quality to the movies seen in the original trilogy, but it was a fitting and satisfying ending to the Skywalker saga.","displayName":"Matt","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T23:25:00.364Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T23:25:00.364Z","user":{"userId":"163AD993-E4E8-4A11-9798-BD9786793362","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Matt","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"loved it! it was bittersweet..I have been watching Star Wars all my life.","displayName":"Erica","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T23:24:50.946Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T23:24:50.946Z","user":{"userId":"556B1503-7BB7-410C-8FD5-944E8B80745F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Erica","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"J.J Abrams having monumental pressure on his shoulders, to not only end a conflicting trilogy but to end a deeply  beloved Saga, gives us the best movie that was possible in the given circumstances.","displayName":"Huzaifa M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T23:23:17.900Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T23:23:27.166Z","user":{"userId":"978420651","realm":"RT","displayName":"Huzaifa M","accountLink":"/user/id/978420651"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Really enjoyed the movie.
