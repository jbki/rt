Smidge better than The Last Jedi but Eps 7-9 have all been remarkable stinkers. \n\nPlot was generally all over the place with more objective hopping in the opening two acts than should be in anything less than 5 hours of screen time. Felt like something that wants to be a movie and seen as a movie, but didn't put any care into the character and emotional build up for the plot turns. Didn't feel like anything real was happening onscreen.","displayName":"Jon C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T14:02:53.064Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T14:22:54.296Z","user":{"userId":"978483414","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jon C","accountLink":"/user/id/978483414"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Although I appreciated J.J.
