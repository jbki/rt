New planets where ones already existed in lore for the exact same purpose. JJ did what he could with what mess Kathleen Kennedy told him to clean up. For a guy not great at endings it was justifiable even if writing was rudimentary. It felt like star wars. Looked like star wars. Unlike the last film, I didn't have the urge to fall asleep. lots of nostalgia, maybe a little too much. Very slight character development. Critics clearly just want to imprint their stuck up views on everyone. I liked it. Didn't love it but it was a good ending with closure and nothing will ever, ever compare or come close to the OT.","displayName":"Al","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:47:59.829Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:47:59.829Z","user":{"userId":"7C5B1C13-0BAB-4C13-B608-AC8BAF922264","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Al","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Beautiful film that encapsulates the themes of the whole saga in satisfying ways.

It felt very disjointed with no story flow and zero edge of your seat intrigue.  Action scenes for just the sake of action scenes and almost no character development or intricacies. That being said, the action scenes were good and when Adam Driver was on the screen - that boy can act, I just wish he'd been given more to work with.    I'll see it again just to make sure I didnt miss anything but honestly, Im not really looking forward to it.  What a bummer.","displayName":"cathleen h","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:47:51.656Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:47:51.656Z","user":{"userId":"416dc547-89eb-437a-ab64-d7ef5c1493c3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"cathleen h","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Definitely better than The Last Jedi.  Thinking about The Last Jedi, the only thing I really didn't like about it was the script, and maybe how the script dictated the actions of the actors.  I also didn't like how, seemingly to me, it didn't advance the story any, with the exception of getting Rey on her own.\n\nLike, many said The Empire Strikes Back wasn't that good.  But, at least we had, \"Luke, I am your father\" to look back on.\n\nThe Rise of Skywalker, though, is a much better script, advanced the story much better.\n\nThere's very little detail/depth in each scene.  As a result, each scene may go quick for some.  But, it's still worth people's time to go see, I believe.\n\nIt stands out pretty well on its own as a movie.  It can help if you are aware of who the characters are (not the actors, but who the characters are they are playing).\n\nI'd rate it about a 7-8 out of 10 (5 is average).\n\nUltimate question for me, would I go see it again?  Possibly.  Probably not, but possibly.  Maybe comparing it like this, I went to go see Knives Out recently.  I didn't like it.  I wouldn't go see it again.  When I see it's on TV, I'm turning the channel.  With The Rise of Skywalker, if I see it on TV, I don't think I'm turning the channel.","displayName":"Steve S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:47:35.802Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:47:41.186Z","user":{"userId":"974483677","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steve S","accountLink":"/user/id/974483677"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"This whole trilogy is such a mess and this last installmemt makes it perfectly clear they had NO plan whatsoever on how this story should end up.
