This overstuffed movie may well be its own trilogy as the film moves along from scene to scene at ludicrous speed. Things happened because the plot demanded it or because of some convenience. Any character not named Rey or Kylo Ren/Ben Solo did ... stuff. The writers gave Rey an actual trial that she must overcome, but she overcomes it with relative ease because of plot convenience.. Bens redemption felt rushed and undeserved.. The final battle felt hollow. Every payoff felt meaningless. Carrie Fisher deserved a better tribute. The actors gave serviceable performances, but they couldnt save this film. Overall, a terrible, disappointing shell of a film that undoes the other two films in the Disney Trilogy, the Skywalker legacy, and the Star Wars mythos overall.","displayName":"E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T18:03:47.120Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T18:03:47.120Z","user":{"userId":"0ff711d3-99eb-4c8a-b81b-98a0f07026d4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"E","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Screw the critics, the movie does a great job of ending the Skywalker saga","displayName":"Miguel E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/816319688792271/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-27T18:03:23.208Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T18:03:26.850Z","user":{"userId":"978484165","realm":"RT","displayName":"Miguel E","accountLink":"/user/id/978484165"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"}]}
