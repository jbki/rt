Hit many of the same notes as the 1977 original for me. Fast, easy, not quite so serious about itself. I suppose there were a number of plot divergences from TLJ...you'd have to ask Rian Johnson I guess. Makes no difference to me...the plot worked fine...and meshed with TLJ as much as it needed to.
