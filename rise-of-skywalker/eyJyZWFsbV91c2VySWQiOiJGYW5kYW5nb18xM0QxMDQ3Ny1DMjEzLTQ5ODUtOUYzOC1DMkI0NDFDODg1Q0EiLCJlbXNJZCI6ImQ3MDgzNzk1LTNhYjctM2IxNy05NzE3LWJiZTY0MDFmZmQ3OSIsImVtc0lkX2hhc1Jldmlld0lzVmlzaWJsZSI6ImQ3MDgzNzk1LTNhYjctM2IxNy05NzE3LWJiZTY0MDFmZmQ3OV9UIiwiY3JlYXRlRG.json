The plot, the acting all of it is just throne together and has no real flow or cohesiveness to it.  There is no character devolpment adn thus we really dont care what happens to anyone, When Anakin fought Obi Wan we cared, Yoda vs the Emperor, Luke vs Vader, heck even the first Rey vs Kylo... in this we get none of it.  How is the Emperor alive? We dont know.  Since when did he have a family? Why is Rey so SUPER powerful? Force skype and force healing may work in comics but they suck in movies.. and force transport objects is freaking DUMB.  The Force Awakens was a great start, Last Jedi ruined it, and this film as much as it tried to fix it didnt do it well.","displayName":"David H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:49:55.920Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T21:32:13.507Z","user":{"userId":"911099301","realm":"RT","displayName":"David H","accountLink":"/user/id/911099301"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I was entertained throughout the entire runtime. \nVisually beautiful and some fantastic practical effects. \nSome ideas in the film seemed just thrown in at the last minute after Last Jedi didnt work for fans.

I Was born in 1976 and grew up with Starwars. I have loved something about all of the movies. That being said the Last Jedi failed in so many ways I was afraid to see this movie. From the opening credits all my worries began to disappear. It was an absolute thrill ride and brought back the joy of Starwars.

As a star wars fan since I was really young, this movie did a very good job of bringing the saga together. I've read EU content and consider myself a more old school fan, and I was very happy to see the dark empire style movie that was shown. Props to JJ Abrams for finally giving Rey a good end to her arc, and giving good background to her strong force sensitivity.","displayName":"Bradyn L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:49:37.384Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:49:37.384Z","user":{"userId":"978453086","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bradyn L","accountLink":"/user/id/978453086"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A classic final to a classic saga that deserve respect of all of us","displayName":"Felipe R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:49:37.124Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:49:49.823Z","user":{"userId":"977913813","realm":"RT","displayName":"Felipe R","accountLink":"/user/id/977913813"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
