I am not a fan of the last jedi, but still it exists. JJ Abrams acts almost like that movie didn't happen.  Why was there no plan or direction for this trilogy? \nMake a cohesive story over 3 films. If you don't have any ideas, use the hundreds of books that exist in the Legends. just a shame, waste of opportunity...","displayName":"Bert V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-17T06:42:19.000Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:37:37.445Z","user":{"userId":"976969344","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bert V","accountLink":"/user/id/976969344"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Disgusting fan fiction.

Although, JJ tried to fill the many plot holes left by Rian Johnson and partially succeeded in doing so but in the wake of doing so created even more egregious holes and mistakes that totally destroyed the Star Wars universe we love. If a person thinks about what they watched they will see so many issues that just donâ€™t make sense. Star Wars is really only episodes 1-6 forget about episodes 7-9. 8 and 9 are huge turds in the saga. I am really beginning to like Jar Jar Binks!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-04T03:40:05.783Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:03:57.488Z","user":{"userId":"976519357","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976519357"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Anything is better then \"The Last Jedi\", the worst movie of all time.
