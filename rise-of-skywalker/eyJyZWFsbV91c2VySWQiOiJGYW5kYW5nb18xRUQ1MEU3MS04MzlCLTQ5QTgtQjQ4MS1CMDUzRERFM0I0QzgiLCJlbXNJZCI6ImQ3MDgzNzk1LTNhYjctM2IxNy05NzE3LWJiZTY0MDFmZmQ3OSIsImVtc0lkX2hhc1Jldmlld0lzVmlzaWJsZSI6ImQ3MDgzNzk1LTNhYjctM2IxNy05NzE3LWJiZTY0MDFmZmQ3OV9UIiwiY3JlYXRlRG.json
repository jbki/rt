First scene with Rey is a hard eye roll. I love the recons, I love the adventure when the main characters are together, but there all consequences have been removed. The number of character death psychs is excessive. The amount of convenience, luck, and things that just magically work just makes the movie boring. I liked about 20% of the movie. 50% could be removed and you wouldn't miss anything. 30% was wtf moments.","displayName":"Jesse .","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T08:30:41.148Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T08:30:59.872Z","user":{"userId":"977816456","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jesse .","accountLink":"/user/id/977816456"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I was absorbed into seeing how this trilogy would wrap up and how it was not going to please everyone.

I can see why the critics are split as this is a fans film and is very different to the Last Jedi (which I loved and without the Canto Bight detour was close behind Episodes V and IV for me).\n\nThe stand outs for me are all the scenes with Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. Amazing chemistry and fantastic lightsaber duels.\n\nIf you haven't watched Rebels I would recommend watching some before you go like season 2 Twlight of the Apprentice and season 4 World between worlds.","displayName":"Adam S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/655534155/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T08:18:30.710Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T08:18:40.024Z","user":{"userId":"826987730","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adam S","accountLink":"/user/id/826987730"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This does not fit in with the original trilogy, retcons several items, the method to beating the main villain is terrible, and it breaks the whole series.
