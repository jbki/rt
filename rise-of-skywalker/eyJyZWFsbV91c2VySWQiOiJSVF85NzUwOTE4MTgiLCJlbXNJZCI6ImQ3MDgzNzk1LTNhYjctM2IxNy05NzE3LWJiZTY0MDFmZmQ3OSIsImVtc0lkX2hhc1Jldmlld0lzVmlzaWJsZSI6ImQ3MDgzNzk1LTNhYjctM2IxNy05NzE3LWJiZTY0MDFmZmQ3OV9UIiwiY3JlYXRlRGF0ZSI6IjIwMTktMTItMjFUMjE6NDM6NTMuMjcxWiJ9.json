I have heard the complaints about fan service and that the film is hurried but upon viewing it I was truly satisfied with how things were brought together.  Characters were used the way they should have been.  The new big 3 of Rey, Finn and Poe have great chemistry along with Chewie and it feels like Star Wars of old.  C3PO who was merely window dressing in the first 2 films of the sequel trilogy is used brilliantly in this film.  BB-8 is as cute as ever.  I found that the footage of Carrie Fisher in the film was really great.  Due to the circumstances, more could not have been done.  These characters felt like the characters I knew and loved from the originals.  Although I certainly didn't hate the Last Jedi, there were things in it that I found very unsatisfying and this film took care of the issues.  I truly loved it and will be waiting happily for whatever the new film in the Star Wars universe may be.  Thanks J.J. for being a fan of the films and knowing what the fans wanted and deserved.  It was a terrific ride and a fitting end.","displayName":"Nancy S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:42:23.255Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:42:48.205Z","user":{"userId":"978461259","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nancy S","accountLink":"/user/id/978461259"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"There’ll likely be plenty of trolls and Russian Bots that tell us this was terrible. You’re enjoyment of this movie will depend on how much you can let go of how you think it should have gone. Someone else was paid to write this story, act this story, and direct this story. I enjoyed it and felt like they did a good job of acknowledging the fans and honoring the old films while being independent enough to tell their own story. Is it groundbreaking cinema? No. But very entertaining and satisfying nonetheless.","displayName":"Brian F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:42:17.495Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:42:17.495Z","user":{"userId":"F06192E6-3362-4881-AEBA-E5A5726CF82E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Brian F","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great continuation of the saga.","displayName":"Mark T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:42:12.404Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:31:23.685Z","user":{"userId":"A5FB1359-3A24-4FEC-B253-41980618A41E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mark T","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"}]}
