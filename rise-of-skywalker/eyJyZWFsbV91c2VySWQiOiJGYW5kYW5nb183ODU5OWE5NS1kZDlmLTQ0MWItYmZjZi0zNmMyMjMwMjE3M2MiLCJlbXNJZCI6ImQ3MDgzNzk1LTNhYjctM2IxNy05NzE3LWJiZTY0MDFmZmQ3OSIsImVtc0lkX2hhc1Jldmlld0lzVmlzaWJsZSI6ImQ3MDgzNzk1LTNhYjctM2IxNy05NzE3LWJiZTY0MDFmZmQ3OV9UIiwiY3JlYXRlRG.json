Bit slow.\n2) Was an improvement.\n\nNow I'm passed the tl;dr heres the main problem with the film (and the reason it got 25%).\n\nEverything was too easy to work out. Without spoiling it, her heritage was a bit meh. Things happened to Kylo which again... was a bit meh. \n\nIt was nice to end the films, but it wasn't nice to end it in that way.\n\nJJ Abrams really fucked this trilogy up.","displayName":"Alex H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/506483694/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:50:42.177Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:50:47.830Z","user":{"userId":"857976829","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex H","accountLink":"/user/id/857976829"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"There is a line in the movie where Mark Hamill says he made a mistake, referencing his time in the Last Jedi movie, which sounded to me like he was apologizing for everyone that had involvement in that movie as that movie gave fans the middle finger. This movie attempts to put out the dumpster fire created by the Last Jedi and put back together all of the pieces that that movie broke. I was happy that some of the spoilers were wrong and that this movie didn't kill off all the old characters just to end the trilogy. They should have just kept JJ Abrams the whole time.  I still wonder what the trilogy could have been if Rian Johnson hadn't screwed up what was setup in the Force Awakens as all of it would have been more seamless and put together with perhaps a totally different episode IX. This movie did a good job, for what it could though, with what it was given from the previous disaster.","displayName":"P K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:50:37.532Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:50:37.532Z","user":{"userId":"976932679","realm":"RT","displayName":"P K","accountLink":"/user/id/976932679"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"So The Rise of Skywalker.

It satisfied the geek in me explaining more of a background to the sith as well as Rey's journey, revealing her history.\n\nThere were aspects of it that I wasn't a fan of. Mainly the telepathic links between Rey and Kylo. Rose seemed to take a bit more of a back seat here which is no surprise after her character was much maligned in The Last Jedi.\n\nHow Star Wars fans will take it is anyone's guess. It was never going to be the level of the original trilogy and 6 movies later plus 2 offshoots later and they still haven't managed to quite get there. However, this does a lot of what it needs to do, there's emotional connections and some pleasing callbacks.","displayName":"Allan R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/792145650/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:50:36.186Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:50:36.186Z","user":{"userId":"307670838","realm":"RT","displayName":"Allan R","accountLink":"/user/id/307670838"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Star Wars episode IX is great film for the saga Skywalker and 2019","displayName":"Romulo H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2495686620644090/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:50:34.698Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:50:38.221Z","user":{"userId":"978440533","realm":"RT","displayName":"Romulo H","accountLink":"/user/id/978440533"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Phenomenal.  JJ Abrams undoes nearly all the damage done by Johnson by focusing on the elements that made the original trilogy so memorable and beloved.   The characters make good choices consistent with their characters.  Unlike Johnson, Abrams knows how to give audiences something new and fresh while at the same time giving them what they loved before.  Abrams' command and fix-it job is so stellar that Johnson's entry makes even less sense with subsequent viewings.  It's just so inconsistent with the values of Star Wars that The Last Jedi casts a shadow over the new trilogy.  But I am very thankful that Abrams still managed to entertain and side step TLJ disaster.  Critics are trying to make this an issue of fan service vs. doing something new.  But it's not so black and white as they are trying to make it.  Johnson did a lot of familiar things but also did a lot of new things, and yet it didn't completely come together or work for more than half the audience.  Abrams gives us familiar and new, but is able to focus on a completely new story--the relationship between Ren and Kylo, and it redeems the whole trilogy.  Loved this movie!","displayName":"Gabriel F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2067410500244856/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:50:31.877Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:50:36.321Z","user":{"userId":"977382168","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gabriel F","accountLink":"/user/id/977382168"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"No idea why the critics hate it","displayName":"Rob","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:50:25.420Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T18:59:28.199Z","user":{"userId":"4FCF27C6-1BA8-4617-BB0A-FFE89B868A7F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rob","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Emotional rollercoaster!","displayName":"Corey","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:50:18.734Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:50:18.734Z","user":{"userId":"13D10477-C213-4985-9F38-C2B441C885CA","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Corey","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
