The big problem with this film is that J.J. Abrams was pulled in at the last minute to direct the movie and he had to fix all the criticism from TLJ and somehow make it work.  Despite some good scenes, this film has over 54 plots holes that I have found so far and counting. I might rewatch it when it comes to Disney+, but I wouldn't recommend buying it on Blu-Ray. I also don't like how they changed the whole lore of the force and make Rey or even Palatine SO POWERFUL without even explaining how they learned certain force powers.","displayName":"Wolfgang L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/418448552001184/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T00:07:22.378Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T00:07:34.811Z","user":{"userId":"977379734","realm":"RT","displayName":"Wolfgang L","accountLink":"/user/id/977379734"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie!
