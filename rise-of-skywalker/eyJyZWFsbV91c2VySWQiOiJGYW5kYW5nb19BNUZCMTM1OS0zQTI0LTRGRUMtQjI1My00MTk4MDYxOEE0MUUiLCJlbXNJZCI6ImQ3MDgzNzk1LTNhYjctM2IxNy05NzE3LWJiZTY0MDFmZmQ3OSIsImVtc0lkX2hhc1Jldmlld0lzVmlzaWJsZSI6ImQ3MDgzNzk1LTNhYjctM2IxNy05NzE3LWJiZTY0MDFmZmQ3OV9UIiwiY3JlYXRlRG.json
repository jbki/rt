Been a Star Wars fan since I saw the first movie in theaters as a child in the 70s.  Wasn't a huge fan of The Last Jedi previously.  But they pulled everything together well in my opinion.  My family and I all enjoyed it.  Good story, lots of action, and plenty of nostalgia.  A fitting end.","displayName":"M V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:42:02.957Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:42:02.957Z","user":{"userId":"978461267","realm":"RT","displayName":"M V","accountLink":"/user/id/978461267"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best ending.
