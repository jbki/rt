I thought The Last Jedi directed by Rian Johnson, was distasteful and made no sense, but this train wreck directed by JJ Abrams, was an abomination to the Star Wars saga. You just never connect to any of the main characters because the editing and the bad overacting never gives you a chance to. The ending of this muck movie will make you walk out the theater with a migraine and ask  yourself.

Hey, it’s Star Wars, so has to be good!  Great action, maybe could have slowed down a little at times. Great acting, Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are awesome. Realistic effects, much better than the prequels. Spoiler alert (kind of): not sure I loved the Emperor’s return, something there felt a little...off. Overall fun and, at times, touching. Enjoy.
