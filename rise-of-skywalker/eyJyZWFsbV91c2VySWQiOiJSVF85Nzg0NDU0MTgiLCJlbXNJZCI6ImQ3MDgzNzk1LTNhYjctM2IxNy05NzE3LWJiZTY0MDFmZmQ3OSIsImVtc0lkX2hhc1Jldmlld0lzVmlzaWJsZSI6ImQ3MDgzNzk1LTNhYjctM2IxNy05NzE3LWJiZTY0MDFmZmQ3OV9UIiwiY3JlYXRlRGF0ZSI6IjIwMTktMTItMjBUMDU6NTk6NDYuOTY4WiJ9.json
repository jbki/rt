It's the first of the Disney Star Wars films to actually capture the essence of what a Star Wars movie is supposed to be. It's not perfect but I blame the short comings more on the fact the Abrams has to spend half the run time correcting for the Rian Johnson disaster known as The Last Jedi. Oh yeah, Rey is too powerful but we all already knew that and I can live with it.","displayName":"Casey M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T05:59:45.424Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T05:59:53.273Z","user":{"userId":"977843280","realm":"RT","displayName":"Casey M","accountLink":"/user/id/977843280"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie.

Hated a few scenes/moments but loved many others. Upon watching IX, I gotta say at least VIII TRIED to do something different.\n\nNON-SPOILER REVIEW:\nKylo/Rey scenes made this movie shine for me. In a movie mainly riddled with callbacks and nostalgic moments, it was nice to see some new scenes with the two main force users. As for the rest of the movie, I think Rian Johnson was saying, \"Let the past die\" to JJ Abrams; or, at least, he tried to. JJ did the opposite of that and said, LET'S THROW EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN FROM THE OLD MOVIES. This film SCREAMED course correction; not only for The Last Jedi, but for some of the old ones as well. People gave George Lucas a lot of flack for the \"Han Shot First\" fiasco, so why is it okay to do that now? \n\nSPOILERS AHEAD:\nRegarding Rey's lineage, I would be okay with that if it was planned from the beginning. A lot of people theorized it, but I don't think that was necessarily the case. With bringing Palpatine back in general, there was no real explanation, and it undermines the last trilogy a bit. There was a lot of the same lines repeated from Force Awakens, which was a bit of an annoyance, especially the scene between Ben/Han\n\nI don't expect this to be my final word for this movie, but these are my first impressions. I'll watch it again because there was a lot to take in, and the burden of not knowing what'll happen is now gone. You could tell this movie was a little rushed and buckled under the pressure of having to end everything. I was gonna give 2.5 but I also think I'm being a bit harsh so 3 will do for now.","displayName":"Neema T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T05:59:30.095Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T05:59:38.610Z","user":{"userId":"961461633","realm":"RT","displayName":"Neema T","accountLink":"/user/id/961461633"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
