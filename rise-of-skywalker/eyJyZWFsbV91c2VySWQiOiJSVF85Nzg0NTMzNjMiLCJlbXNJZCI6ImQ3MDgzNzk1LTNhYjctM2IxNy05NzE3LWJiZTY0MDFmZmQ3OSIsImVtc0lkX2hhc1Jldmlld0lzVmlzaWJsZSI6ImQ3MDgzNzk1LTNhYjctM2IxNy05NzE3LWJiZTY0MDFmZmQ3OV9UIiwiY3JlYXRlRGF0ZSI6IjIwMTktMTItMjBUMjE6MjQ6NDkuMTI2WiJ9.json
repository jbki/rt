Threw away characters again and made even more plot holes. New force powers make the deaths in the old films seem pointless. No explanation for things we've wanted to know and things we wanted to find out in this film. Star Wars is not a flashback type of movie, I didn't like that they did that either.","displayName":"Seth C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1830520257080014/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:24:46.680Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:24:49.770Z","user":{"userId":"978439655","realm":"RT","displayName":"Seth C","accountLink":"/user/id/978439655"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"If you are a fan, you will truly enjoy this movie!","displayName":"David A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1310360797/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:24:38.676Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:24:44.801Z","user":{"userId":"913757350","realm":"RT","displayName":"David A","accountLink":"/user/id/913757350"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"THE FALL OF SKYWALKER","displayName":"Aaron W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/835752023424137/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:24:29.275Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:24:33.934Z","user":{"userId":"977881829","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aaron W","accountLink":"/user/id/977881829"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Saw 9 this morning, liked it a lot better and I was very reluctant in going. Pleasantly surprised and in a strange way let's me enjoy Star Wars again, now maybe I'll get around to seeing Solo which kind just passed by. Reviews are right in a way, it is \"safe\" as in it tries to actually be a Star Wars movie as you know and even expect it, but to me that is a good thing. And a lot better than the arrogant, pretentious artificial dissonance that was 8.","displayName":"Jordan T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:24:17.865Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:24:20.350Z","user":{"userId":"903887762","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jordan T","accountLink":"/user/id/903887762"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Perfect ending like endgame but for Star Wars","displayName":"goat","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:24:04.918Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:24:04.918Z","user":{"userId":"5B1EC89A-E60E-4D96-BC32-7CEB51A5CCEE","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"goat","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Continue graphics, but not much story line","displayName":"Ken B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:23:55.116Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:23:55.116Z","user":{"userId":"CE3DB5AB-7FBC-41BC-8B3F-413165967DD2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ken B","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Star Wars was always about something bigger. The OT and PT dealt with the rise of fascism and the defeat of an Empire. There were allegories to WW2 and Vietnam and to Hitler. \n\nIt's ok that Star Wars is basically junk food but this was a nostalgia bomb that really wasn't fun to consume. JJ had an impossible task after The Last Jedi went full nihilism and left him no plot threads to work with. But bringing back the Emperor was beyond stupid.","displayName":"Benjamin M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1900599/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:23:37.925Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:23:43.796Z","user":{"userId":"792918742","realm":"RT","displayName":"Benjamin M","accountLink":"/user/id/792918742"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"When fans are rating a movie so highly and critics aren't you have to wonder  if said critics have liked anything.
