Bored so much nearly dropped off. Predictable in every way. Cheezy lines, bad acting, terrible editing (jumping everywhere), music was even somehow badly used. Does tie up loose ends I guess (or put it another way puts down the rabid dog of a franchise at last.) Really in 2.5 hours, there were no (0) surprises in terms of plot. Special effects ok but that's really expected these days. \n\nTeenage boys also hated it. Arguing on the way how whether it was worse than episodes 1-3?
