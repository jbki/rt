It's supposed to be epic and grand and full on, and while you get hints of action throughout, it just never quite satisfied. JJ Abrahms did fine with the material he had but in the end it didn't feel like the grand conclusion it should have been. To be honest I liked TLJ but they basically tried to retcon everything in it, to the point where it lacked heart. It simply doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie. It's got no sense of wonder. And while it was an okay movie it's just not up to scratch with other Star Wars films. That being said JJ did the best he could with what he had, so i dont blame him for it. I blame the fans..... and also Rian Johnson","displayName":"Dan H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/264955277815290/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T12:44:00.936Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:43:10.594Z","user":{"userId":"978448720","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dan H","accountLink":"/user/id/978448720"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great movie if you like star wars you will like this","displayName":"Michael T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T12:39:31.397Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:17:26.223Z","user":{"userId":"978448616","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael T","accountLink":"/user/id/978448616"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"We got the steak, now we got the sizzle.

Sure I probably understand why critics haven’t been so nice to this film. The movie is not perfect but is super enjoyable! Great humor and lots of fun! The trinity is together on this one.
