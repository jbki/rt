However, JJ Abrams trademark frenetic pace means that the 2.5 hours it is on passses relatively quickly and is only really painful to watch during periods in the 2nd half of the movie, hence it receives 2 stars from me, not 1. Many people have said you need to switch your brain off for this movie to enjoy it (and on that basis seem to think that it deserves 5 stars). In my case switching my brain off made it just about bareable for the 1st 45 minutes before it started to get eye rollingly bad to the extent that I wanted to laugh. None of the 5 people i went to see it with (all original trilogy fans) had a good thing to say about it other than that the time passed relatively quickly for such a long movie. In trying to undo the wrongs of The Last Jedi, Disney have made an equally bad movie, but for different reasons.","displayName":"David B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/61403883/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T10:04:55.035Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T10:05:06.911Z","user":{"userId":"783302767","realm":"RT","displayName":"David B","accountLink":"/user/id/783302767"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"A waste of money on a movie with no scenario, no proper characters and absolutely no stakes to the whole action.
