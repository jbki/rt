It also tries desperately hard to feed its fans the lore and grandeur it thinks they want, rewriting backstories and seemingly trying to cram two films into one (a symptom of the sequel trilogy failing to have a unified vision from the beginning). That all being said, The Rise Of Skywalker still feels like Star Wars with plenty of surprisingly thrilling moments, fun action, strong actors, spectacular visuals, and a genuinely fascinating story to tell. It might not be quite on par with the best of the franchise, but Rise Of Skywalker should just be the satisfying conclusion to the story that fans need it to be.","displayName":"Forrest P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T06:16:08.062Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T06:16:57.563Z","user":{"userId":"966347470","realm":"RT","displayName":"Forrest P","accountLink":"/user/id/966347470"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"22h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The story gives us hope that good people who work together as a team can make things happen.
