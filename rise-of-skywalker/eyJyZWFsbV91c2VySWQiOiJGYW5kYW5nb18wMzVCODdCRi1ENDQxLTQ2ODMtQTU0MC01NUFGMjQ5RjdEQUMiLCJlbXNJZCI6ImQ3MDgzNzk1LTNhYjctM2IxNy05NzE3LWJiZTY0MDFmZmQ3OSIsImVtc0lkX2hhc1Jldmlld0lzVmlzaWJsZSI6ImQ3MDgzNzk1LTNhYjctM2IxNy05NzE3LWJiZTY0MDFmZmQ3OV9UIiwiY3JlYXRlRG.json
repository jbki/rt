Welp. The Rise of Skywalker may not win any \"film\" awards, but I am one damned happy Star Wars fan right now. Call it a guilty pleasure, maybe it is a bit TOO much of a movie for \"the fans,\" but I can't remember the last time I grinned during an entire movie like this. TLJ may be a good \"film\" but not a great Star Wars film (to me). I need to see this more, but my god I was just EATING IT UP. I wanted more, and more and more. It was epic, emotional, heavy, tragic, exciting, etc. There are problems, of course, and it is kind of a mess of a film in some ways. They literally crammed 2 movies into one. I wore a dorky Star Wars xmas sweater to the theater, and I was afraid that I would be taking it off at home in disappointment or even disgust (some people, and film critics don't like the movie)... but man, now I want to wear the thing on my friggin' head. Very happy fan right now. Honestly, after seeing this, TLJ feels like a weird side-story that doesn't even fit into the trilogy. JJ should have had the whole thing, or they should have made this movie into Pt1 and 2 like the Deathly Hollows.","displayName":"Jeff D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T05:59:07.138Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T05:59:15.599Z","user":{"userId":"977295481","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeff D","accountLink":"/user/id/977295481"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved it!
