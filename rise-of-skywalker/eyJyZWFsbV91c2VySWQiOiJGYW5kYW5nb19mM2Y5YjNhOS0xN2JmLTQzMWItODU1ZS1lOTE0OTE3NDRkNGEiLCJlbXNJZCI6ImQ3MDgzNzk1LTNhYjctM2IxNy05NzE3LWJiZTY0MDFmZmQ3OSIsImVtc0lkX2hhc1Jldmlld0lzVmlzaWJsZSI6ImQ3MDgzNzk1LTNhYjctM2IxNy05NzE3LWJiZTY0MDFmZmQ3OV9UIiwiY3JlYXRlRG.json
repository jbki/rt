The cinematography is outstanding and the character arcs are all tied up wonderfully.  I thought it was great.  My son said it was his favorite movie of all time.

Don't listen to the haters, this is a perfect ending.","displayName":"Jeremy K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T10:07:32.627Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T10:07:32.627Z","user":{"userId":"978489284","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeremy K","accountLink":"/user/id/978489284"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Solid movie.

They improved much on what we as fans hated about the Force Awakens and the Last Jedi.
