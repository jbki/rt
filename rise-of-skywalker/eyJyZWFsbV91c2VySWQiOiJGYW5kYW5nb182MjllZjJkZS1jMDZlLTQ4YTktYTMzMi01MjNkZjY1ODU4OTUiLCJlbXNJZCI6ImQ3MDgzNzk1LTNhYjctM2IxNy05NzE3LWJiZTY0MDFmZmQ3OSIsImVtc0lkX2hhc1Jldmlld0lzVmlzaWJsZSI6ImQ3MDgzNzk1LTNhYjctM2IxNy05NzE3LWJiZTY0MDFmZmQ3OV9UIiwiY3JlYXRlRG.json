I hated what they did to Luke in the last Jedi. After hearing about the return of Palpatine, I was worried they ruined Vader's legacy as well. \n\nI was wrong. This is an exciting adventure from beginning to end. No I am not a bot or paid off reviewer, just a big Star Wars since fan 1980.\n\nWhat made the movie for me was Ben Solo. He finally became a Jedi at the end of the movie, and redeemed himself, just like his Grand father.\n\nI'd recommend this movie.","displayName":"Nicholas F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000091147170/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T20:26:57.597Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T20:27:53.129Z","user":{"userId":"943243248","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nicholas F","accountLink":"/user/id/943243248"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It was the best movie of the new trilogy, sadly that is not saying much.

If you listen to the reviews here you would think you went to a different film. First its called scifi,second its a finaly to along franchise.it could not be a film, 4 to 5 hours long to recap and re invent all preceding \nFilms that came before it.if you don't see the other films then you miss alot of interplay this movie accomplishes. Both with the films from before and the new releases.it's a satisfying conclusion and an openning to the next chapter of the Starwars SciFi saga.it has a little bit of everything you could want in an enjoyable\nMovie. My advice dont listen to the critics or the YouTube's if you like starwars see  see it in 3D its worth it","displayName":"Eli C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T20:25:45.519Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T20:25:50.497Z","user":{"userId":"978484525","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eli C","accountLink":"/user/id/978484525"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Fine movie that could be watched although would be confusing having not seen the previous movies.","displayName":"James G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T20:25:00.989Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T20:25:00.989Z","user":{"userId":"746b20cb-6bb4-4b4e-8e30-c744171c094b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"James G","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Everything was rushed and disjointed.
