About an hour in I was exhausted from all the exposition and extra details that weren't needed. There was no set up to the \"main villain.\" I wish JJ would have taken what Rian did and added to it in a better way than just backtracking and correcting. As with the prequels, the first two films seem pointless given the last. The last is also too much correcting and changing to fit into one movie. The sequels alone are reason enough for Disney to give Star Wars its own Kevin Feige. They really need one.","displayName":"Donald H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:07:36.288Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:07:39.834Z","user":{"userId":"977988380","realm":"RT","displayName":"Donald H","accountLink":"/user/id/977988380"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The movie shoved a bunch of things in that Rey just randomly can do now, and never explained how the bad guy who should be dead is back. The movie as a movie was okay. The lack of explanation on how things just happen and why Rey is literally now pretty much the most over powered Jedi is left a mystery besides saying hey she is related to someone. Overall I walked out of the movie annoyed with the story. The actors did fine in their roles. Special effects were good. The story was pretty bad.","displayName":"Phill O","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1243661008/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:06:56.631Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:07:06.729Z","user":{"userId":"947380707","realm":"RT","displayName":"Phill O","accountLink":"/user/id/947380707"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Should've stop at 6th episode","displayName":"Aziz Y","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:06:41.218Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:06:41.218Z","user":{"userId":"978471292","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aziz Y","accountLink":"/user/id/978471292"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Horrible!  The story felt like a cobbled together mess.  The beloved old characters from the original trilogy have either been killed off, made obsolete or relegated to nostalgic props.  Rey is an idealized character with no interesting flaws or endearing attributes.  Her unprecedented powers are unearned and violate the Jedi mythos as set forth by Lucas.  The survival or Palpatine largely nullifies the resolution at the end of Return of the Jedi.  Rian Johnson created a huge mess that Abrams made it messier to the point of incoherence, totally destroying the spirit and arc trajectories of the original trilogy.  A sad end to the saga.  Identity politics have taken a front seat and displaced the Joseph Campbell monomyth motifs that made the old trilogy so great.  \n*Also, in the original trilogy, force ghosts were more akin to private spirit communications and personal subjective experiences of Jedi with deceased force users.  In the new trilogy they can poke you with a stick (Yoda in Last Jedi) and levetate physical objects (Luke's ghost lifting the old X-Wing).  This is just one example of the sloppy disregard that Disney had for the parameters of the original mythos.\n*Another problem was that they were able to transfer light saber through force communications.  This is another example of force powers being made exaggerated to the point of being absurdly out of step with the originals.\n*And how did all those people at the end run on top of the ship that was in space?  Was there a force field holding air in?  This seemed incongruous with the idea of the ships being in space as presented in the other movies (e.g. Princess Leiah being sucked out the window and frozen in Last Jedi).","displayName":"Will F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:06:23.939Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:43:19.671Z","user":{"userId":"978471287","realm":"RT","displayName":"Will F","accountLink":"/user/id/978471287"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A perfect culmination of this epic story, brought up each emotion in just the perfect mix.
