At this point, no reviewer or hardcore fan I know has said it was awesome, so it's just really disappointing. It makes me appreciate the prequels.","displayName":"Kara I","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2633476310040050/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T02:00:06.705Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T02:02:00.482Z","user":{"userId":"978499658","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kara I","accountLink":"/user/id/978499658"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I will concede that it wasn't an amazing movie however, with that said, I loved the movie as I loved the whole franchise and it was great to see this nine-movie saga, which started the year that I was born, come to a finish in the only way it was meant to finish, good over evil...","displayName":"Kris Torres","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T01:59:26.418Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T01:59:26.418Z","user":{"userId":"BDC6FA12-69E5-438A-96AA-FB9ABE049833","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kris Torres","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Don’t listen to critics!

This film tried to fix Luke’s character... But damage was done in the previous film... Also the handling of Rey’s character could have been done much better throughout the 3 movies... A very rushed film and the final battle was over so quickly... I don’t know why they could not make it better like the final battle in the revenge of sith... Overall since there is nothing else to watch in the theater it was ok because of visual effects...
