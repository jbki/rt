This movie also undercuts the importance of the original trilogy. The biggest sin was probably bringing back the emperor. Rey was to powerful for the amount of training she has had. The movie also dosnt answers it's own questions and has sever story threads that dont ever get fully realized. I'm disappointed and I hope moving forward we get something fresh and and original.","displayName":"Adan R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1439785731/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:46:47.048Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:47:03.350Z","user":{"userId":"928068685","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adan R","accountLink":"/user/id/928068685"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I really enjoyed it honestly.

This was weekend at bernie's, a lifeless & soulless corpse being paraded around as if it was something it certainly was not. \n\nThe best I can say is that it was dull & forgettable. \n\nAt worst, it was a mockery of what Star Wars once was; full of continuity errors, cringe moments, minimal story, no character development & Mary Sue characters. It was like watching a video game of: go to location a, now b, now location c & activate the predictable quick time event. \n\nFor what was claimed to have been & for what should have been the \"endgame\" of Star Wars, the end of 40 years of cinema, the skywalker story, it was little more than cookie cutter popcorn flick that really shows how lazy, uncaring & predictably boring Disney is now.\n\nIn the end, this felt like a quick wrap up of a story that was ruined by the last Jedi & everyone involved just wanted to wash their hands of it & try to pretend this never happened.","displayName":"Benjamin K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100004204385011/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:46:37.444Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:46:39.197Z","user":{"userId":"970245881","realm":"RT","displayName":"Benjamin K","accountLink":"/user/id/970245881"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The movie was more focused on appealing to the critics of TLJ that they forgot to create a meaningful or even coherent plot. The film spends most of its time retconning TLJ and TFA and trying too hard to distract us with nostalgic scenes of original Star Wars characters and locations. TROS asks questions that it never answers, and introduces new characters that have no purpose while reducing already existing characters to almost nothing. The ending is not uplifting or hopeful despite the beautiful score trying to convince you otherwise. Ironically, after the divisive mess that was TLJ, you will be better off seeing Rian Johnson's Knives Out.","displayName":"Regan J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:46:35.137Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:48:10.412Z","user":{"userId":"978452880","realm":"RT","displayName":"Regan J","accountLink":"/user/id/978452880"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great overall plot and ending to the saga!!

This movie captures the thrill and magic of the original trilogy. I'm seeing it at least two more times this coming week.","displayName":"Michael M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/568073077/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:46:22.258Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:46:28.229Z","user":{"userId":"909949899","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael M","accountLink":"/user/id/909949899"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
