Without spoilers I would say it is a patchwork of fixes of all the wrong that Ryan Johnson did that in the end, left more unanswered questions. So much stuff to fix and not enough time to push the story along at a pace that gave all the characters proper development. A fun roller coaster with non stop action the whole time but I don’t like scavenger hunts. I think the shortcomings of this movie are more Ryan Johnson’s than JJ’s. There was too much to fix. JJ did the best he could with an imposible task.","displayName":"Rocky R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T20:29:41.297Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T20:29:41.297Z","user":{"userId":"4E4EB8BD-0704-4E5E-A8EA-48DEDAD9C539","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rocky R","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I enjoyed seeing the movie but it seemed a bit anticlimactic for a series ending movie. it felt rushed even though the movie was 2.5 hours. when I compare this to End Game, Star Was ep 9 just felt rushed and didn't have a good flow.","displayName":"Mike L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T20:28:51.417Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T20:28:51.417Z","user":{"userId":"B6433AE5-0B62-4158-8676-5DA133013025","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mike L","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved the whole movie overall.
