Characters and scenes are guven no room to breathe, lots of important things just get handwaved away and all plot twists are heavily foreshadowed and a 5 year old could see them coming a mile away. The atory reads like a third rate fanfiction and the dialogues remind me of one too. Its awkward and ridiculous at all the wrong places and invaludates eps 1-6. JJ can shove his nostalgia baiting right up. Pure unadulteted garbage, 1/10.","displayName":"Gerg T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2236707259688443/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:30:48.634Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:30:53.538Z","user":{"userId":"976925892","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gerg T","accountLink":"/user/id/976925892"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was great. I enjoyed every moment of it. Any negative reviews you see are people who nitpick everything and are never happy with anything. You can down talk anything if you try hard enough.
