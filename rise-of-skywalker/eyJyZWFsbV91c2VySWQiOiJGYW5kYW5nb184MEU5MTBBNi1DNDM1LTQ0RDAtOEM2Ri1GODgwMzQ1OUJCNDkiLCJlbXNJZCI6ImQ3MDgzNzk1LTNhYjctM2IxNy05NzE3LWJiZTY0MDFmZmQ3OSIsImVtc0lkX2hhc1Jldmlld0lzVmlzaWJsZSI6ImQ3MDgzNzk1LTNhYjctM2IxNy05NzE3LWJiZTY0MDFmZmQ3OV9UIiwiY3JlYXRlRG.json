You can tell that it was written for a mass market, which is ok. What's worse with this trilogy is that you can tell that these movies were not written as a trilogy. They clearly make stuff up as they go and try to change things retroactively and it's exhausting. Finn's character got shafted. I enjoyed the Rey/Kylo character arcs and the performances were solid. Just wish the storyline was a little more consistent and creative.","displayName":"Alan F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T23:45:23.943Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T23:45:36.475Z","user":{"userId":"978499409","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alan F","accountLink":"/user/id/978499409"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"An epic and satisfying conclusion to not only the sequel trilogy, but the entire saga.
