HOWEVER, that being sad, I feel like my favorite movie franchise has been decimated from a storyline perspective. The music is superb, the acting is fantastic, the directing, editing, storytelling all is below mediocre. I wanted to love it to see it 2-4 times in theatres, as I have in the past, but I wont. I'm just glad this painful process is over.","displayName":"Michael C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10157905601649630/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T13:28:29.506Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T13:28:35.293Z","user":{"userId":"978479802","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael C","accountLink":"/user/id/978479802"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Very well done.
