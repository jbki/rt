The Skywalker legacy and direction of this film seemed to fit the original narrative started by Lucas more so than the previous narrative with Johnson.  I feel the outrage crowd and critics feel a sense of emptiness that the potential was taken out and momentum faltered.  I see it otherwise, the storyline concludes in a way that feels fitting regardless of small critiques about parts of the movie that I have no experience to critique in the first place.  I liked it, it made me happy, and my childhood was reignited for a couple hours as I watched the legacy of this triple trilogy end with a new purpose.  If you go in wanting that I think you'll get it, if you go in wanting it to be more than the spectacle of a space opera you might be let down.","displayName":"Try V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/22420228/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T18:27:28.655Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T18:27:40.309Z","user":{"userId":"798698114","realm":"RT","displayName":"Try V","accountLink":"/user/id/798698114"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved the final movie!
