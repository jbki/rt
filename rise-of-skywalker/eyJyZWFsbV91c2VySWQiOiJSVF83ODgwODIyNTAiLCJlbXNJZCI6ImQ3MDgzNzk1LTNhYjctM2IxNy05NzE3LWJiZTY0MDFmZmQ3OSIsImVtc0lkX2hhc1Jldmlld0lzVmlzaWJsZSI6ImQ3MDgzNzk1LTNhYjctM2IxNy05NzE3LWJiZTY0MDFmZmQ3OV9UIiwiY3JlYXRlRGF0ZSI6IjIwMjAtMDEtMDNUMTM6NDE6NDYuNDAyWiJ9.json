Plot twists were also pretty good, some were a bit forced though, but that's what plot twists are like sometimes. It certainly repairs the Sequels trilogy and you should watch it if you haven't already","displayName":"Guido K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T13:33:48.768Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T13:33:48.768Z","user":{"userId":"978500565","realm":"RT","displayName":"Guido K","accountLink":"/user/id/978500565"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"15h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Been a Star Wars fan since 1977. I’ve watched all the trilogies. This barely beat out any of the episodes 1-3.  JJ screwed the pooch. Not following the story line set out by George Lucas means this story line makes NO sense.  Would I go see it again?  Nope. Would I recommend watching?  Meh!  Only if you must!  Disney can do better than this. Look at PIXAR and MARVEL.  They have SNAFU’d the films.
