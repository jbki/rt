I can admit I was 9 when I first saw \"A New Hope\", it's been part of my whole life. This is fantasy and storytelling, sit back and enjoy it. We can analyze all the Easter Eggs, look at plot holes or \"unnecessary\" manipulations, cry that it's ruined my whole life (really? that invested?), but if it was a historical documentary, we'd just have to accept it. So, read reviews, read spoilers, take the opinions of others, get elated, excited, or get mad and angry, make up your own mind. Might it change how you decide to spend your next movie $$, or what Lego toy you might buy at 50-years-old... maybe. It has left me wanting more. This is world-building, it's all not perfect (turn on the news). We never saw where Aunt Beru bought her Blue Milk, or heard Uncle Owen yell at Luke to take out the trash. These are huge sweeping stories, painted with large brushes, told in 2+ hour chunks, over a period of 40+ years. Enjoy it.\n\nFor this movie, specifically, it's a rush. I was emotionally exhausted by the end. I was enveloped by the story and satisfied with the outcome. Yes, there were some plot points that I'm wondering about, but I'm more interested in finding out in another story, or just making it up in my mind. Overall, however, I'm still as big a Star Wars nerd as before, wanting my own Millennium Falcon, eagerly awaiting more.
