Rey is absolutely insane even holding a ship mid air while its all rdy heading to space lol and then even blows it right outta the sky that's when i was like i had enough within a 15 min span your jaw will absolutely drop is totally unbelievable basically put all the jedi powers into one person that's how it feels absolutely ridiculous.

At best you will find it mildly entertaining. As for me I thought the film in itself was rushed, full of plot holes, poorly developed characters, and overall nothing redeaming. As the finale to they Skywalker saga, if you will, it was an absolute travesty but oh well. FYI I did not pay to watch this I watched it for free overseas.","displayName":"Tony B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/82501247/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:51:12.485Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:51:17.571Z","user":{"userId":"803255508","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tony B","accountLink":"/user/id/803255508"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The movie is cool, exciting, full of references, but it is very similar to the return of jedi, doesn't innovate in the saga, Appeals a lot in the emotional and events of the classic trilogy","displayName":"Danilo C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2364454873815003/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:51:04.638Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:51:28.149Z","user":{"userId":"978441997","realm":"RT","displayName":"Danilo C","accountLink":"/user/id/978441997"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"}]}
