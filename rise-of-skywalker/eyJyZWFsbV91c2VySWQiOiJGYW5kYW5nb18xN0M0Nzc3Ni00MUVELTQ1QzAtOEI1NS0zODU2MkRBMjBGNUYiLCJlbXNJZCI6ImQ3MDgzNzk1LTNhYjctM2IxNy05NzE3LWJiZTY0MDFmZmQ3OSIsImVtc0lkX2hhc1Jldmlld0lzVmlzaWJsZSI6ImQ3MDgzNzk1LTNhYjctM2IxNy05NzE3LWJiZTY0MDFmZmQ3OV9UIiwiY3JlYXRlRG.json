About as good as you could expect after The Last Jedi. I had no expectations for this film, so in that sense I suppose it was better than I'd hoped. The sequels are so badly thought out and the characters so one dimensional that I still just don't really care. The original trilogy are still head and shoulders above the rest.

As the third in the new series, it seems to dedicate a lot of time undoing, redoing, or fixing things that happened in the previous movies. I didn´t find the characters endearing and I felt the plot was uninteresting to say the least. I hope they don´t try to resurrect the movies again because this was a disaster.","displayName":"John B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T22:27:18.517Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T22:27:18.517Z","user":{"userId":"978484968","realm":"RT","displayName":"John B","accountLink":"/user/id/978484968"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Way to many plotholes, the whole trilogy did not make sense.","displayName":"Evan J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T22:26:43.888Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T22:26:49.848Z","user":{"userId":"978364224","realm":"RT","displayName":"Evan J","accountLink":"/user/id/978364224"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Yes this movie was amazing, definitely a movie that’s finally answers all the questions that we the fans had about Rey.
