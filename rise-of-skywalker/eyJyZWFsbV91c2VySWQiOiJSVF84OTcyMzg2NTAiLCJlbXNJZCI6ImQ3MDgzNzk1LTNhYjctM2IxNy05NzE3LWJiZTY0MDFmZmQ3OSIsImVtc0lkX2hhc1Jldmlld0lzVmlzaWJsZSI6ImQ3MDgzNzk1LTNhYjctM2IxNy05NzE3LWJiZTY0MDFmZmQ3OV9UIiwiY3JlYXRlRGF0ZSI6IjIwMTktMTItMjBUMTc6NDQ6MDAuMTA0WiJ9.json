That’s how long it has been since the first Star Wars movie. The Skywalker Saga has been a long and amazing series that’s spanned over decades. The Rise of Skywalker had 42 years of that Saga to cover, and it does it well. Develop your opinion about how it should have ended but know that in TROS, you will ride the nostalgia that brought us this amazing series in the first place. And in the end, remember how much joy this series has brought to you as a child and now as a grown adult. The movie was excellent.

Although this shouldn't have been a problem in the first place, it did a wonderful job of correcting the mistakes of The Last Jedi, and did many characters right.
