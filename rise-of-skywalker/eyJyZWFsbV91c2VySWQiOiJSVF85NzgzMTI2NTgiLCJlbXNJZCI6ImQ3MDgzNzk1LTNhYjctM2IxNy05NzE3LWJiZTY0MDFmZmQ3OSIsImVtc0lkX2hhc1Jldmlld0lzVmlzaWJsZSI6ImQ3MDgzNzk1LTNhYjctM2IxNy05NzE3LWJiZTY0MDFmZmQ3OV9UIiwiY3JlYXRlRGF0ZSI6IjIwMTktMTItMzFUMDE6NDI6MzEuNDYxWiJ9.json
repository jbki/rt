I know that others are upset with it and I understand but that has not change my mind that the movie as a whole was one of the best of the saga.

And dont compare it to the originals. If you go into this movie with a fresh and clear mind, you will find a film that is enjoyable, thrilling, surprising, funny at times, and gratifying. It is action packed, interesting, and has a clear story arc. If one were to overanalyze and dissect every scene, you could find fault with anything. But in and of itself, Rise of Skywalker is a very good movie. It isn't the best of the 9 installments, but it's in the top 5 and does the series justice.","displayName":"James A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T01:39:10.430Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T01:39:16.854Z","user":{"userId":"976941893","realm":"RT","displayName":"James A","accountLink":"/user/id/976941893"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Meh.

Imagine being a writer of the most beloved franchise of three generations, questioning your decisions through three movies, taking the criticism and holding on waiting to drop this and make them all eat crow.
