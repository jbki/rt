Was it a mess in places? Sure. Was it a perfect film? Of course not.  Was it everything to everybody? Hardly. But what movie is? It was an entertaining, beautifully shot, exhilarating ride that wrapped up most of the hanging questions and sent off the Skywalker saga in style.","displayName":"Neil M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/724822105/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:04:00.691Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:04:04.840Z","user":{"userId":"799837873","realm":"RT","displayName":"Neil M","accountLink":"/user/id/799837873"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"I can't separate myself from the work and love that George Lucas put into the lore and history of his modern myth. Though, this movie is more of a middle finger to Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi than a love letter to the original trilogies, I found it lazy and schizophrenic at the same time. The visuals were amazing, but had the originality of the Cleveland Browns helmet redesign. There was not a story less convoluted in the entirety of the series. Normies will slide through this like prunes through a goose, but real fans will see some glaring problems.","displayName":"Jesse Y","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:03:57.671Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T11:17:58.723Z","user":{"userId":"978453110","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jesse Y","accountLink":"/user/id/978453110"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The only Star I can give here is for the sound track... \n\nI have never seen a something so treasured by many to be so destroyed. \nYou can clearly see JJ fighting for the last word in this series. This feels like it was more  of a sequel to the first movie than a third movie. Not to mention this movie clearly alienates most of the original cast. I feel a lot of characters suffered in this contest of Directors and you can see that it has hurt the series in a terrible way. \n\nI did my best not to point out spoilers, but this movie creates so much confusion its ridiculous.","displayName":"Joey B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:03:49.707Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:03:49.707Z","user":{"userId":"976934885","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joey B","accountLink":"/user/id/976934885"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
