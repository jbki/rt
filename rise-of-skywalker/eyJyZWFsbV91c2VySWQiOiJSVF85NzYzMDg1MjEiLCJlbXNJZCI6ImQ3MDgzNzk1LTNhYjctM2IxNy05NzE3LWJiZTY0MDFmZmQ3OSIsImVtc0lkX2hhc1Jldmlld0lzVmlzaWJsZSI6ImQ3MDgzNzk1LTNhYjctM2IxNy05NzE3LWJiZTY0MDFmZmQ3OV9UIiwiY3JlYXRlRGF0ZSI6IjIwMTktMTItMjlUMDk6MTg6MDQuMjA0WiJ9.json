If you are not exposed to the story beyond that of the films, then elements of Episode IX will be lost to you, and you will have to look up videos online to explain them. The pace went a bit too quick in some scenes, which could've been given much more time.","displayName":"Tim H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000917790970/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T09:17:53.369Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T06:39:27.152Z","user":{"userId":"911602342","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tim H","accountLink":"/user/id/911602342"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"ehhh.
