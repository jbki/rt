What an Epic End to an Epic Saga. I laughed, I cried, and I clutched my son's hand throughout the movie in both suspense, and intense joy and excitement.

It is a very safe film and appeals to fans for most of the movie. The climax is probably the best in the new trilogy and Ian McDiarmid steals the show whenever he is in a scene. The biggest problem with the film is that it was somewhat forgettable and if it wasn't called Star Wars then chances are the the entire new trilogy would be forgotten in 5 years. 6/10, a fine but forgettable movie.","displayName":"Bryce S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:42:46.194Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:42:52.484Z","user":{"userId":"978299622","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bryce S","accountLink":"/user/id/978299622"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I grew up on Starwars Watched the trilolgy over and over at my grandparents house and I can say this is a fantastic ending wow!
