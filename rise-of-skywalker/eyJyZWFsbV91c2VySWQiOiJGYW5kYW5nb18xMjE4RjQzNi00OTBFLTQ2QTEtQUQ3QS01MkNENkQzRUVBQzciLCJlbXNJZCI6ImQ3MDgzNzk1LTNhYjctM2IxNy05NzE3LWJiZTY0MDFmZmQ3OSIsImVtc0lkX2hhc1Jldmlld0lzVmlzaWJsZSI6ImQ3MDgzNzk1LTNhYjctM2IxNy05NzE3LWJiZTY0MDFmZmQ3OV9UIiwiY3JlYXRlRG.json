The story was fast and hard to keep up with. Some of the story didn't make sense and the story from the last two movies weren't continued. It felt like they made up a lot of the story to make it \"enjoyable\". Not to mention I was really excited to see Adam Driver play as Kylo Ren/Ben Solo but was crushed by the ending. I was very disappointed by the movie and I think it was a horrible end for the Star Wars Skywalker saga.","displayName":"Savanna S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2861334180590290/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T20:04:42.405Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T20:07:45.895Z","user":{"userId":"978480832","realm":"RT","displayName":"Savanna S","accountLink":"/user/id/978480832"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Rushed, unpolished story, JJ seems to think we are all idiots!","displayName":"Sharron","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T20:03:12.109Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T20:03:12.109Z","user":{"userId":"FEC8F30B-D7FB-449C-A480-448423B7BE6B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sharron","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wonderful close to an amazing saga, despite the prequels.","displayName":"Michael E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T20:02:49.214Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T20:02:49.214Z","user":{"userId":"075fdca2-6d0d-47ad-bddf-0166b3a4e667","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael E","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"The movie was a patch job of doing damage control from The Last Jedi and building around what scenes they had left of Fisher.
