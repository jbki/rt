That said, while this movie looks beautiful and moves along at a break neck pace it is ultimately disappointing. All of the pieces were there where this Disney trilogy could have been good but it had no game plan. If this had been the second in the trilogy with one more to follow I really don't think there would have been the disconnect that this series has suffered. The middle film undid the flow and flipped the whole game board and it resulted in this Frankenstein's monster of a movie. If you stop to think for one second the whole thing falls apart","displayName":"Jon W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T00:08:31.788Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T00:08:38.531Z","user":{"userId":"848152348","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jon W","accountLink":"/user/id/848152348"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I don't get all the hate except that the story could have been better.
