Unfortunately the damage was done by Rian Johnson's total lack of respect and understanding for the material. JJ Abrams was left with a dead end story and little to nothing he could do to save it. Ultimately the fault lies with Kathleen Kennedy for overseeing this entire botched sequel trilogy. She hired the wrong people and prioritised the wrong things. She has to go ultimately.","displayName":"Rory P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/960665886301/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T18:51:36.544Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T18:51:44.666Z","user":{"userId":"976992015","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rory P","accountLink":"/user/id/976992015"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I was intrigued from start to finish.
