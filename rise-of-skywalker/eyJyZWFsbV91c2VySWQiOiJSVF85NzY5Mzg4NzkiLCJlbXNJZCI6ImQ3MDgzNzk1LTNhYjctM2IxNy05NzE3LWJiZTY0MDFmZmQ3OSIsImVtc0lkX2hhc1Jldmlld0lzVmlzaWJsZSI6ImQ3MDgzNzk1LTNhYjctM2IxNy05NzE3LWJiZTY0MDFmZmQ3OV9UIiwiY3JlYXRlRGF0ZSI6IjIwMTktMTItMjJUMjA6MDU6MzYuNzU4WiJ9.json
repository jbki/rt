I think it's a great close to the trilogy, not necessarily the entire saga. I still enjoyed it though and have seen it twice already. I get that some people will love it and some people will hate it, they can't please everyone.

A great end to all the things setup in The Force Awakens and in many ways a big middle finger to The Last Jedi.  This movie may save Disney StarWars for many but it was a close call and I hope new leadership is installed at Lucasfilm. Great job and congratulations to JJ And crew for doing the impossible.","displayName":"Marco P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10162612758125576/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:05:24.167Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:05:32.483Z","user":{"userId":"978466344","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marco P","accountLink":"/user/id/978466344"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this last movie of the trilogy. The action was non-stop and the emotions run high. It has all the qualities I enjoyed in the original trilogy. A great return to form after the puzzling and at times boring story of The Last Jedi. Lando was great, Finn and Poe enjoyable again after being pretty stiff in the 2nd film.","displayName":"David B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1145937950/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:04:45.915Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:04:53.331Z","user":{"userId":"951820561","realm":"RT","displayName":"David B","accountLink":"/user/id/951820561"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great story and movie.
