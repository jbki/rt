Some scenes have that really wanted nostalgia feeling of old-time great sw, others are more like scenes from Harry Potter. The end of the movie is plain, it feels like JJ Abrams cant make those amazing final battles as we have seen in Revenge of the Sith or in Return of the Jedi. However, I think it can be considered as the best of the current trilogy which after those two is a huge relief.","displayName":"Daniel K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T22:33:19.164Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T22:33:19.164Z","user":{"userId":"978453914","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel K","accountLink":"/user/id/978453914"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Solo olvidaria la parte tipo romeo y julieta","displayName":"Jorge A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10221219103404004/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T22:33:15.336Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T22:33:23.881Z","user":{"userId":"978453915","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jorge A","accountLink":"/user/id/978453915"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I don't understand why anyone wouldn't like this movie.

Key script failure: Annhilation of the prophecy of \"the chosen one\" where Anakin is finally no use to restoring balance in the force. Second failure, the ending Ben Solo scene which make absolutely no sense.\nFor everything else than those two script failure, this is the best Star Wars ever in rhythm and realisation-wise. You were so close to the perfect master-chief and you made the best of the Rian Johnson mess from the last episode.","displayName":"Arthur A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T22:32:51.761Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T22:32:51.761Z","user":{"userId":"978440849","realm":"RT","displayName":"Arthur A","accountLink":"/user/id/978440849"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The film is absolutely great, a good ending for the saga.
