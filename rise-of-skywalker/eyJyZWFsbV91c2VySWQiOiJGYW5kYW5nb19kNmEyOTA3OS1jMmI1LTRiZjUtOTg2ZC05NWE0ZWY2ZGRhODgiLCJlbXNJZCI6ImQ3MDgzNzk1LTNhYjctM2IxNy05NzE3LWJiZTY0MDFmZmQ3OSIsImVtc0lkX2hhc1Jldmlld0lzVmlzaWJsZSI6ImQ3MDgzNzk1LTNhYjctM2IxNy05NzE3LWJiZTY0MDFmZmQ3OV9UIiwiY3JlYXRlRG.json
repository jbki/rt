Was there some forced contrived dialogue? Yep. Were there some plot moments you went \"huh?\" Did we go places that had you scratching your head? Absolutely. But as in GOT, you try to wrap up a cultural phenomenon; you try to tie up every loose end and do something brilliant and unique that satisfies the throngs. A tall task. Please take note of the AUDIENCE rating for this film, not the critics, most of who weren't even alive when StarWars began. I enjoyed the film; it paid homage to many of the characters and tropes we've grown to love over the years. Does it feel like something we've seen before? Of course it does, as it should. So, out on your vintage Star Wars t-shirt and grab a bucket of 29.95 popcorn and sit back and enjoy. Damn the critics. Light sabers and Ewoks ahead.","displayName":"Damon W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/761770553/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-30T15:36:49.001Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T15:36:58.674Z","user":{"userId":"913656986","realm":"RT","displayName":"Damon W","accountLink":"/user/id/913656986"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was essentially a re-hash of the older series.  Rebels have the odds stacked against them, comes down to 1 person who is conflicted but then comes back to their senses.  Main characters are killed off.  Same story of the \"Skywalker\" saga since the first Star Wars release.  Although good ending of an era hopefully the story continues with other characters and spin offs.","displayName":"Kevin L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T15:36:09.574Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T15:36:09.574Z","user":{"userId":"ab4c1bab-7c8b-465c-821a-1878465d5052","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kevin L","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Classic end to the Star Wars saga.
