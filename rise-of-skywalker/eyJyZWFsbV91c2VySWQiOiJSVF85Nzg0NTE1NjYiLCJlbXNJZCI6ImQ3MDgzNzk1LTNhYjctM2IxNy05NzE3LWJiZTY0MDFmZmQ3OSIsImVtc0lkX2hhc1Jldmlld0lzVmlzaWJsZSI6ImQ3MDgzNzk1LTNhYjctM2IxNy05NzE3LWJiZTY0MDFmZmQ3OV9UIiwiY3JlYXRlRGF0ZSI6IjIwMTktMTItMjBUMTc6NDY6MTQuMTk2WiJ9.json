Im still pissed at Disney, and Kethleen kenedy, and rian johnson, but J.J Abrahams made up for alot with this movie.  Its very fast paced the entire time and isnt a movie for bathroom breaks, so go beforehand.  I loved this movie!  This isnt the best star wars movie.  It doesmt redeem the sequel trilogy.  But dont think about that.  Go to this movie because deep down you love star wars, and after 3 years of all of this CRAP that we have gotten, go because you wanna see something good.  Go becauae you wanna see Luke aand Leia and Han and Chewie and even Lando treated right.  Go because you are interested in why the emperor survived.\nGO BECAUSE YOU LOVE STAR WARS!! And because deep down, you are just a kid who believes in the force as much as i do.  Thank you J.J.  the force was obviously with you for this one","displayName":"Jarod F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10211648276801234/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:46:07.150Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:46:16.654Z","user":{"userId":"978451510","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jarod F","accountLink":"/user/id/978451510"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Choppy, badly paced, emotionally hollow and mind-blowingly-shallow. This movie goes at such a breakneck speed that you don't have time to process the story beats, and the story beats themselves are pretty contrived attempts to apologize for the Last Jedi. 3/10 Star Wars aside, it's a bad *movie*. Like, if this wasn't Star Wars IP, it would be put in the same category as Justice League or Ready Player One.","displayName":"Richard B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:45:56.223Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:45:58.514Z","user":{"userId":"978451543","realm":"RT","displayName":"Richard B","accountLink":"/user/id/978451543"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Non-stop thrills and a fitting end to the Skywalker saga","displayName":"GxMan27","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:45:54.197Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:45:54.197Z","user":{"userId":"c568208b-5d3d-4178-89a3-414029001167","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"GxMan27","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Not on par with TLJ\n. \n. \n. \nin terms of disappointment.","displayName":"Thanate L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:45:51.635Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:46:39.170Z","user":{"userId":"977272596","realm":"RT","displayName":"Thanate L","accountLink":"/user/id/977272596"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Like others, I felt like this installment played it safe, and yet still robbed us of intense emotional moments we were hoping for. Some of the moments played incredibly well, and let the audience breathe in the depth of feeling we needed to have, especially when some of those moments included finales for characters we care about. But those moments felt fleeting, as the rest of the film's pace went so fast, I found myself asking: what have I just seen? Was that brand new information? Why was is packaged to me as if it was information I should already know? I am certainly not the kind of fan that feels a decision regarding a character's heritage will make it or break it for me, but I did feel that the way it was delivered was jarring and confusing in the end. It felt in some ways that JJ Abrams tried to make his own trilogy within the trilogy, which made the final product too hard to follow. Even simple pick up shots to pace movement and travel were cut down so much, I barely got to experience each place or person. It's too bad, because some of the performances are of course fantastic. But all in all, it's not a movie in excited to see again and I'm sad it ended this way.","displayName":"Arielle R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:45:38.185Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:45:54.383Z","user":{"userId":"978451453","realm":"RT","displayName":"Arielle R","accountLink":"/user/id/978451453"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Rise of Skywalker holds the other two movies completely on it's own!
