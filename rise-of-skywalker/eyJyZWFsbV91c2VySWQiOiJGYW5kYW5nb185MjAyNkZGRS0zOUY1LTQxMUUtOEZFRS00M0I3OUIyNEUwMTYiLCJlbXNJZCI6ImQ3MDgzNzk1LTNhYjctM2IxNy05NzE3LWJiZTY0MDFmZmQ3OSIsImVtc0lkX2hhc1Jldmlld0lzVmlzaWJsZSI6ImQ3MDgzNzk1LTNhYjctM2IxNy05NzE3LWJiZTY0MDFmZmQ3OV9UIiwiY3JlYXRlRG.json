Most that i read are bad saying the film is too nostalgic and not looking forward enough. Errrr, it's the last one. As far forward as you can look is the end credits. Theres no more. \nI'm a ESB fan. Best movie of the franchise imo. The prequels started bad but but episode 3 Ienjoyed them. Disney has taken over and has taken on a huge task of trying to make a fresh look at star wars and keep die hard fans happy. I love the new films. Last jedi had problems but still liked it. The finally is exactly that. A finally. And a dam good ride if you ask me. It's not without problems. Carrie Fisher scenes feel awkward, but a much needed farewell.  There is loads of nostalgia in this film. I mean but the bucket load. It's got a few twists and turns, and story is a typical star wars story, but what's bad about that? \nJJ Abrams was never going to please everyone, but in my opinion he knocked it out of the park and will miss old and new cast alike.  Bring on episode 10!!!!! Oh wait......\nQuick note. My wife hates star wars.  This film didn't change her mind","displayName":"Craig D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2887273587972237/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:11:16.803Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:13:55.934Z","user":{"userId":"978466317","realm":"RT","displayName":"Craig D","accountLink":"/user/id/978466317"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Same story line!

The film is the most fast paced of the entire franchise, but how they handled it I felt was great. 7 was a carbon copy of 4. 8 completely went in a different direction of how Luke's arc was in the previous movies. But 9 was awesome. Of course certain parts I would've changed but overall a great movie and I wish J.J could've done all 3.","displayName":"Jake L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100004948264022/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:10:15.907Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:10:21.820Z","user":{"userId":"942586640","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jake L","accountLink":"/user/id/942586640"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"}]}
