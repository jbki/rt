The whole thing is way different than any other Star Wars movie.  A little disappointed that most of Carrie Fishers scenes were used in the first few minutes of the film.  I know things would have been different if she had survived to film the movie, so they did what they had to do.  Her death was dealt with honorably, I think she would have been proud. Was nice to see a lot of loose ends tied up very well this time around compared to Revenge of the Sith.","displayName":"Jac M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2603268919703185/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T21:08:32.222Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T21:08:46.559Z","user":{"userId":"978071458","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jac M","accountLink":"/user/id/978071458"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Love it.
