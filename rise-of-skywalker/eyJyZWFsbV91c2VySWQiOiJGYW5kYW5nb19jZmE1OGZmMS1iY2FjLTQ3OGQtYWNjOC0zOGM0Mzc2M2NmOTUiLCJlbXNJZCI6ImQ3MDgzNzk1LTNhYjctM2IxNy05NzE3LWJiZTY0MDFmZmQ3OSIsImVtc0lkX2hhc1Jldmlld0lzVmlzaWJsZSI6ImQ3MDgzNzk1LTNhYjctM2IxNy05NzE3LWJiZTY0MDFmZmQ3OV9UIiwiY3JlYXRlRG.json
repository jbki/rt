J. Abrams films picked up almost exactly where Force Awakens left off. Many saw it as a punch in Johnson's face, when the latter's film left Abrams nothing to build on. \nOnce again, the director had to rebuild the confidence of an extremely demanding audience certainly, but above all, emotionally involved in this series for so long.\nThe paste of the film is fast, very fast, and while some creative decisions left me perplexed, this was a really fun ride and a satisfying conclusion to the saga. \nIn conclusion, Rise of Skywalker taught me that Disney had opened a pandora box by purchasing the rights to Star Wars and should now move as far away from the Skywalker family as possible to be successful, as the Mandolorian showed us it could.","displayName":"Louis-Charles P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1569079019802551/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:20:31.203Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:20:49.503Z","user":{"userId":"977031574","realm":"RT","displayName":"Louis-Charles P","accountLink":"/user/id/977031574"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Theatre and movie was great!","displayName":"Isabel","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:20:27.698Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:20:27.698Z","user":{"userId":"F57CBC60-C7D4-4B06-ADC0-458D7EA8BF48","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Isabel","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I can see how people didn't consider it to be a good Star Wars movie, but I loved how it played out, and had very touching scenes that gave the characters a bigger story.","displayName":"Gracie D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:20:11.247Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:20:11.247Z","user":{"userId":"A4468E60-6425-4A4D-A05C-95101FD119B4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Gracie D","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"All past movies culminated into one.
