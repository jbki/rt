I originally thought problems were too easily fixed but then realized Abrams was approaching this movie considering the homework has already been done by the viewer. First viewing and I thought a bit convoluted but hit all the high points. Second time I saw it was after a marathon viewing of all Star Wars films (prequels > originals  >current trilogy) and it made much more sense and I really appreciated what Abrams had done. It was a fitting endâ€¦ not perfect, but fitting.","displayName":"Derek N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/627331975/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T20:49:57.354Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T20:50:17.662Z","user":{"userId":"906508220","realm":"RT","displayName":"Derek N","accountLink":"/user/id/906508220"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I liked the way they answered some questions about Rey, and put a nice spin for the ending.
