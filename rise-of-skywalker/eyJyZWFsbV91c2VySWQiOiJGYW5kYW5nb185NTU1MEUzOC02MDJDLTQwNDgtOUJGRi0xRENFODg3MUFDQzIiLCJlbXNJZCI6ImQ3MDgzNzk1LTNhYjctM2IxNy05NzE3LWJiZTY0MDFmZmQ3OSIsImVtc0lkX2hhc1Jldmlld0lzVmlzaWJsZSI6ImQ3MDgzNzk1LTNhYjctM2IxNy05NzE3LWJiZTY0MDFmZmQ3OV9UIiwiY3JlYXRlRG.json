Finally a stronger and dominant Vadar/Kylo Ren character and a masterful Jedi/Rey. Just enough humor and dark story. The drama and adventure is amazing. Can't understand the Fin role, it just throws the movie off for me. The actor is great in other movies but this was not for him.","displayName":"FreddieD","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T16:20:59.665Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T16:20:59.665Z","user":{"userId":"c502419f-6ceb-4f5a-bb3f-3fa679fc6268","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"FreddieD","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This movie is very fast paced compared to other Star Wars movies but it does manage to answer questions the previous film didn't. It still leaves some things unanswered though. Overall, I thought it was good and had an ending which allows for more Jedi/Star Wars in the future. But this movie does have some problems. The main problem with this movie is it doesn't flow well with themes brought up in TLJ. It retcons decisions made and ignores several characters which were introduced. This is kind of jarring and really showcases the fact there was no narrative plan from 7-9. I think if one director was allowed to direct all 3 films the story would have been much more solid.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T16:20:49.651Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T16:20:49.651Z","user":{"userId":"260268557","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260268557"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Some of the parts had flashes of the original trilogy story lines, but it was a fitting end to this story line.
