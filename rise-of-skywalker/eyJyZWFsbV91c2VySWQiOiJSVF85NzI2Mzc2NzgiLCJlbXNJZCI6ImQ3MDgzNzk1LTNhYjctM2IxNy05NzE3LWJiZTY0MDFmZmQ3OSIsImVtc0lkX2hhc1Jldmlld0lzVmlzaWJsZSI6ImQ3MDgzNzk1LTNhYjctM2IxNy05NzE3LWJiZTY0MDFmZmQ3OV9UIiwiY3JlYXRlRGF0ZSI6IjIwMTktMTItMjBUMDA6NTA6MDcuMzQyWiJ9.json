You can tell that this movie tries to solve the disaster that the Last Jedi was and that is somewhat satisfying. However, by doing that it feels like they had to put 3 movies into one. They had to set up a new villain, tell Rey's and Poe's backstory and had to connect everything back to the original saga. I feel that they made the best of what they could with the material they had. Disney should have created an outline for the entire trilogy because this trilogy turned out to be a mess...","displayName":"Hidde D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:49:19.777Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:49:19.777Z","user":{"userId":"978442434","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hidde D","accountLink":"/user/id/978442434"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Does this movie have flaws?

Is it perfect? No; few movies are. But it has a lot of heart, endearing characters and it looks beautiful (it was fantastic in 3D). Given that there was no real plan for this trilogy when they made The Force Awakens, the writers deserve a lot of credit for tying things together so well. All the performances were top notch. They also make wonderful use of the limited footage they had of Carrie Fisher. I'm sure that, like The Last Jedi, this movie will get a lot of criticism. But, I feel sure that the characters of Rey, Finn and Poe will endure; in large part to this film.","displayName":"Richard C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/581261552258621/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:47:01.351Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:47:10.777Z","user":{"userId":"977300578","realm":"RT","displayName":"Richard C","accountLink":"/user/id/977300578"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The worst movie of the saga.","displayName":"AW S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:46:56.136Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:47:06.988Z","user":{"userId":"976969689","realm":"RT","displayName":"AW S","accountLink":"/user/id/976969689"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved it.
