It was great.   It captured the Star Wars essence perfectly, had some really satisfying tie-ins and for me, it blew TLJ out of the park.   I have watched Star Wars since it originally came out in the theatres and I was so happy to see it finish on a high note.   I will see it again.  Somehow the new Jumanji has a better critical rating.  Why?  Because that movie offers what the audience expects out of it.   In this case they should expect a Star Wars film, full of cheese, the force in its darkness and light, great action, great cgi and some spotty acting.   hello, have you not seen A New Hope??","displayName":"vince d","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:02:32.812Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:09:59.551Z","user":{"userId":"978471060","realm":"RT","displayName":"vince d","accountLink":"/user/id/978471060"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best film of StarWars ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:02:19.485Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:02:19.485Z","user":{"userId":"976620454","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976620454"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"nothing special but still fun","displayName":"Marc","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:02:07.139Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:02:07.139Z","user":{"userId":"26163E9A-DC97-4C78-89A6-286101913738","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Marc","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"How do you wrap up one of/the most iconic movie franchises of all-time?
