The Force becomes warped dream logic and overall, vast numbers of action sequences, classic props, space ships and familiar action sequence set ups are trotted out in a quick-cut, disposable fashion. Dialogue is broad and generic, score never really soars either. If this is corporate filmmaking at its biggest and best I recommend staying well away, as this is basically a very bad, disposable picture tied to a major IP. Rated two stars instead of one for quality sets and background art, plus a really, really large CGI rendering of ocean waves, which felt momentarily inspiring.","displayName":"Lariste K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T09:34:32.794Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T09:34:40.827Z","user":{"userId":"974516939","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lariste K","accountLink":"/user/id/974516939"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I'd rather re watch the final season of game of thrones on repeat for the next year and nothing else, i love star wars, i loved solo, this sucked.","displayName":"Stephan G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/835382367/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T09:31:31.707Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T09:31:39.002Z","user":{"userId":"829603685","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stephan G","accountLink":"/user/id/829603685"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I nice surprise.
