This movie in my opinion was an attempt to retcon TLJ that simply didn't have enough time to flesh out the characters. There were some staggering plotholes and huge missed opportunities.   If it was a standalone movie it would get 4/5. As an ending to a trilogy I would say 2/5.","displayName":"Joseph G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3789514744395572/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:04:46.943Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:04:56.428Z","user":{"userId":"978452718","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph G","accountLink":"/user/id/978452718"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Worst Star Wars movie ever, rather spend $6.99 on the Mandalorian","displayName":"Rye N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:04:46.853Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:05:21.014Z","user":{"userId":"977241989","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rye N","accountLink":"/user/id/977241989"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Movie for the true fans.

It was a move for hardcore Star Wars fans. Emperor Palpatine was written in wonderfully, and this movie goes hand in hand with the previous eight. There is a definite appreciation for the franchise as a whole. However, dialogue was clunky at some points and there were a couple scenes that were just unnecessary, which keeps it from a full five stars.","displayName":"Joshua L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:04:01.221Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:04:01.221Z","user":{"userId":"978452723","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joshua L","accountLink":"/user/id/978452723"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I LOVED this movie! It answered so many questions and respected the fans! JJ did an excellent job trying to salvage the wreckage from the last Jedi. My only critiques are that it was too rushed because it was too short. It could’ve been a lot longer and allowed the plot to breathe a bit more. But overall very enjoyable- I cried, laughed, and was awed by the incredible music, special effects, and acting!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:03:46.543Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:03:46.543Z","user":{"userId":"260343556","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260343556"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
