However if you understand this new triology's \"redemption and reconciliation\" tone then you will not be disappointed.  There is plenty of fan service and easter eggs throughout and the entire 2 hours and 5 minutes is not wasted.  Good laughs, inside jokes, and a good message end this trilogy on a fair note.","displayName":"Raymond H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10210284345335712/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:38:06.910Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:38:10.281Z","user":{"userId":"977019600","realm":"RT","displayName":"Raymond H","accountLink":"/user/id/977019600"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Anakin who?

It resolved some of the issues caused by The Last Jedi, but also because of the requirement to resolve those issues, it wasn't quite as good as it could have been. I blame that on TLJ though.
