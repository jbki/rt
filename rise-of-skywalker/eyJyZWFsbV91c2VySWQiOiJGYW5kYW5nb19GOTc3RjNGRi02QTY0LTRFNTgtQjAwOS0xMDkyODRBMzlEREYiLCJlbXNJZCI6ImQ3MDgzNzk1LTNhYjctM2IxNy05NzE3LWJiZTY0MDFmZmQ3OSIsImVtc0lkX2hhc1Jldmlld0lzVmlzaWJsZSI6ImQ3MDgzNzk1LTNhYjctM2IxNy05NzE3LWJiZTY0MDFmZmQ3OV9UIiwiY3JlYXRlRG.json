Rey was more of a Mary Sue than ever before with nonsensical explanation for her powers. Not a boring movie but, not one that I will be rewatching anytime soon. Definitely felt like it was made to win over the fans who disliked The Last Jedi but, dropped the ball. As not only the finale of this Trilogy, but also \"The Skywalker Saga\", it left much to be desired.","displayName":"John S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:17:43.501Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:21:53.305Z","user":{"userId":"978452806","realm":"RT","displayName":"John S","accountLink":"/user/id/978452806"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Walked away happy for sure.
