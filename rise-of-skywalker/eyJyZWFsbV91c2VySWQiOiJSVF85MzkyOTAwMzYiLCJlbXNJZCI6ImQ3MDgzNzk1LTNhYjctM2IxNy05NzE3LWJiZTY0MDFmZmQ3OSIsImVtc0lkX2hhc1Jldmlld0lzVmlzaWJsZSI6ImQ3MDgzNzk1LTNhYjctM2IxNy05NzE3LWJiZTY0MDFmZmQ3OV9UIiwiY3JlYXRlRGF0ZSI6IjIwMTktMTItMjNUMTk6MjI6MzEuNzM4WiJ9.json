It pays homage to previous films created in the storyline but still does a fantastic job in giving the franchise a new spin. \n\nAs a Star Wars fan I admire the way the film respects previously developed characters and continues (ultimately finishing) their arcs. I also appreciated the way the film integrated the element if mystery and adventure that has become synonymous with other films in this franchise. As a film buff I admired the messages that it poses to its viewers and the unique ways that only a Star Wars film can present them.\n\nAt times early in the film it does seem like the story is rushed due to the fact that transitions from scene to scene are ineffective. Ultimately giving the viewer the feeling of a prolonged rising action just for the movie to slow down and continue progression to the climax. None-the-less all of the information that is presented is needed in order to create an effective climax which the film achieves. \n\nWhich is the reason why I give a 4/5, the film pulls several different emotions out of the viewer as it should. If my rating was based on percentage it would be an 87%.","displayName":"Nathan S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1718991034867473/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:21:25.799Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:59:33.879Z","user":{"userId":"977890264","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nathan S","accountLink":"/user/id/977890264"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"TFW Episode VIII was so good the Star Wars community rioted and they wrecked it. ðŸ˜•","displayName":"death2cupbots","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T19:21:11.583Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T19:21:11.583Z","user":{"userId":"C4B1E259-8548-4CE5-A397-BEC202CAA6AB","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"death2cupbots","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"I really did not like the story and the development of this movie.

Few interesting parts in the action but you spend time playing catch up. The continuity is horrible, and thereâ€™s just parts that either make no sense to the overall plot device or itâ€™s thrown in there to movie the story when it gets stuck trying to figure out what it wants to be. Itâ€™s a pretty bad excuse of a trilogy ending, or a trilogy at all.
