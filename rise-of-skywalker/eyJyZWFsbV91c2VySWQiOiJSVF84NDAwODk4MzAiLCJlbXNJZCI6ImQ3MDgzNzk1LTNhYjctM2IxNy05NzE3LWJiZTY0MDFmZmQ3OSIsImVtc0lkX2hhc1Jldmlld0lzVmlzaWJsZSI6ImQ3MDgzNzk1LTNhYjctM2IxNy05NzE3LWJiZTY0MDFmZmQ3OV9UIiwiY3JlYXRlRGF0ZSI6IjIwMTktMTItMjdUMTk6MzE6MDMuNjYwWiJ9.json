Digital of Leia was so \"awkward\" - they wrote the script around what they had vs. what was important to the story. Too many \"ghosts\" (really?). They tried to get everyone in there - many gratuitous cameos nothing to do with this story, thin as it was. Disappointing. Just short of putting me to sleep. Paid extra for special screening (theater effects) and it didn't help. If I was watching it at home, would have turned it to a different show.","displayName":"Stephanie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T19:30:34.915Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T19:30:34.915Z","user":{"userId":"262f8af8-03c8-44ef-a03a-fc2bbb97b21d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Stephanie","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"its not bad, it's  not good. it's forgettable. nothing felt special about this film.","displayName":"Armando Garcia G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T19:29:56.469Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T19:29:56.469Z","user":{"userId":"BD1C97A3-9701-454B-A100-03EA63C2E814","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Armando Garcia G","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"a good entertaining movie.
