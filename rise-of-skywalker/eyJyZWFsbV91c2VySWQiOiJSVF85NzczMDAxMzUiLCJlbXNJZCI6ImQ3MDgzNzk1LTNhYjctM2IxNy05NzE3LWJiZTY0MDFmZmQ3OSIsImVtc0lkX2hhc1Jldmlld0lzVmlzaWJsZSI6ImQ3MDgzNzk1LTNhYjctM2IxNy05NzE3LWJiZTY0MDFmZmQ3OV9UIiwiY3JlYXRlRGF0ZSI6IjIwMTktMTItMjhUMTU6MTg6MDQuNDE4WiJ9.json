Is a tad all over the place, a lot of content in the movie that could have been in The Last Jedi of Rian Johnson had better intuitive. With great (but not too much) fanservice and a movie that feels like it belongs in the Skywalker Saga, JJ Abrams successfully fixes what The Last Jedi somewhat ruined and made a very fun and enjoyable movie with amazing cinematography. Just don't think too much about how Palpatine survived!","displayName":"Joseph M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T15:08:53.567Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T15:09:03.859Z","user":{"userId":"977515861","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph M","accountLink":"/user/id/977515861"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I liked it.
