How did the Final Order send all those star destroyers around the Galaxy for the final celebration scene when they were in one location for the entire film?  It seemed that a lot was made up just to move plot points and show off movie \"magic\".  Overall the film was fun as Star Wars should be - so be prepared to giggle and marvel at the effects but know that the film isn't great.","displayName":"MikeL","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T16:00:40.108Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T16:00:40.108Z","user":{"userId":"e28a866e-2885-4e6a-af18-1f7730ed8f96","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"MikeL","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Was a good conclusion to the series.","displayName":"Chris","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T16:00:01.286Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T16:00:01.286Z","user":{"userId":"2e820e9f-126f-43bd-8746-68b33959d567","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chris","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is an action-packed wrap up to the original Star Wars saga.

The performances were also very solid, especially Adam Driver per usual. Sadly, that's about all this movie has going for it. Throughout the entire runtime, I felt no emotion toward any of these characters. The major moments that are supposed to draw a reaction, left me emotionless. This movie feels disrespectful to the Star Wars franchise; relying wholely on nostalgia and adding force powers that we've not only never heard of, but are incredibly over powered and ridiculously convenient. What a disappointment.","displayName":"Robert S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000396300082/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:57:42.264Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:57:50.454Z","user":{"userId":"924714019","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert S","accountLink":"/user/id/924714019"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"A last minute job tp end a 42 yeast series ro correct mistakes Abramas made with the last films.
