The story was okish but non stop new scene followed by new scene with no continuity.

It has no clue how to maintain its own story, lacks an ounce of logic if you connect the dots, has no integrity to its own lore within the same trilogy.

It does move very fast and the last act is a bit convoluted but there's a lot of heart here and a great performance by Adam Driver. Satisfying way to end the sequel trilogy, but it can feel like they missed some opportunities at the end.","displayName":"Irvin N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T11:00:17.048Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T11:04:43.152Z","user":{"userId":"978495883","realm":"RT","displayName":"Irvin N","accountLink":"/user/id/978495883"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Kind of a jumbled mess.
