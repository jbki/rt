I found myself whispering and guessing what the dialogue will be based on the highly predictable questions one instance: Luke to Rey “-Who are you afraid of -Myself” very, very basic. Regardless of that I did not expected some cameos like Harrison Ford’s or all the Jedi voices. I liked the redemption path and regression to Ben Solo that we had I just wish he hadn’t gone that way or that Rey’s lineage and dark side was explored more not just merely presented.","displayName":"Nicole V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T04:42:52.496Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T04:42:52.496Z","user":{"userId":"A07645C7-9227-47B4-9FF5-8A7745CF2B3E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Nicole V","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was a good ending to this saga.
