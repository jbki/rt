Instead of answering questions and tying up loose ends, it left us with more. In a turn that shows complete lack of empathy or understanding for what it's like to lose a child, it denied a mother desperate to reunite with her child that reunion. It denied the characters those of us who suffered from abuse and loneliness as children best relate to the one human connection that had the biggest and most meaningful setup. It transformed Lupita N'yongo's memorably eccentric character into a walking violation of the \"show, don't tell\" rule of writing, and it very nearly did that to Adam Driver's character. The failure to show him reunited with his family or alive with the woman who made it possible also was a failure to conclusively, satisfactorily close out his and the heroine's arcs. There are a lot of fun easter eggs and cameos. On the other hand, there are some very unsubtle attempts to capture some shallow resemblance of Return of the Jedi without actually sharing any of the same heart. It's as if Abrams was so desperate to prove his fandom credentials, he completely missed the point of Star Wars - even losing sight of a lot he himself set up in The Force Awakens.\n\nThe greatest tragedy of it all was that, as a Star Wars fan of 42 years, I desperately wanted to like this movie. And I did, for the most part. I felt it had a lot of beautiful scenes. I love the cast. They performed spectacularly. But they, the movie, the Skywalker saga as a whole, and the audience - barring a certain set with some violently irrational hatred of Adam Driver's character - all deserved far better than a pretty good movie wrecked in the end by poor writing designed to appease that lowest common denominator of fandom.\n\nMovies, like other stories, are best remembered by how they end. Nobody ever comes out of a movie saying, \"That was the best beginning and second act ever!\"\n\nI live in the second nerdiest state in the country. A Star Wars movie here almost always gets raucous cheering at the end. Instead, the reaction from the audience was raucous cheering in the beginning, protests and tepid applause at the end. If this were a football game, Abrams had an easy chance to score a winning touchdown at the end, and he instead ran the ball into the wrong end zone.","displayName":"Valerie F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1278778912/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T21:43:43.734Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T21:43:49.993Z","user":{"userId":"861586026","realm":"RT","displayName":"Valerie F","accountLink":"/user/id/861586026"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"While not the best movie I've ever seen, it was a solid final chapter to a 42 year story.
