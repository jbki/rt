I'm one of the fans that really enjoyed the direction that the last Jedi was taken the franchise and wanted this film to expand upon that. Other than that this movie is gorgeous and beautifully acted. \nThe director was obviously scared of a toxic fandom to take any risks. Still overwhelmingly emotional and entertaining.","displayName":"Krystofer b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:29:42.287Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:31:17.753Z","user":{"userId":"978095135","realm":"RT","displayName":"Krystofer b","accountLink":"/user/id/978095135"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Better than Last Jedi ,worse than the holiday special.","displayName":"Oskar S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:29:17.603Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:29:17.603Z","user":{"userId":"976411071","realm":"RT","displayName":"Oskar S","accountLink":"/user/id/976411071"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie despite its flaws is still perfect as it is Star Wars.","displayName":"William A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2399407516837523/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:29:04.967Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:29:16.078Z","user":{"userId":"978442137","realm":"RT","displayName":"William A","accountLink":"/user/id/978442137"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best movies of star wars, it doesn't deserve all the bad criticism that it has","displayName":"Mati J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:28:02.569Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:28:02.569Z","user":{"userId":"978405813","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mati J","accountLink":"/user/id/978405813"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"12/20\nIt's really not a trilogy, but more 3 independant films","displayName":"Alberto A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:27:54.866Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:28:10.370Z","user":{"userId":"978442129","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alberto A","accountLink":"/user/id/978442129"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Just a PERFECT ending.
