JJ Abrams did an excellent job specially after what happened with episode 8. I had a blast watching it on the movie theater and so did the people who were with me. It brings a big sense of nostalgia and it is really well passed. There was never a moment where I felt it was boring. It just felt like Star Wars! And I'm glad that Disney showed that they can actually make Star Wars.","displayName":"Ana C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:54:07.737Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:54:14.514Z","user":{"userId":"977633037","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ana C","accountLink":"/user/id/977633037"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wrapped up the whole saga.
