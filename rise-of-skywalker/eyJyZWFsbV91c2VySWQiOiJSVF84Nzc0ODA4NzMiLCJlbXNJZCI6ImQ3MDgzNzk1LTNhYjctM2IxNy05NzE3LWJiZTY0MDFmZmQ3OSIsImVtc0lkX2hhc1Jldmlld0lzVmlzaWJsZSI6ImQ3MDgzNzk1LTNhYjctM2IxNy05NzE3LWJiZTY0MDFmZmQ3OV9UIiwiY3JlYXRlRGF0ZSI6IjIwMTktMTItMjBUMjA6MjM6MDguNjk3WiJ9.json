I started to cry at the end, not cause i was sad. but pure happiness that they finally got it right and did every one justice in the end. I couldint be happier for this final movie in the skywalker story. The last jedi still haunts me, but this movie was down right awesome and had alot of things in it that turned everything upside down for me, and for that in am truly Greatful JJ Abrams i thank you for making things good again. Alot made me doubt this movie, and that it was gonna make everything worse. and i deeply feared it, but i loved it. i Absolutely loved it, and when a movie makes me tear up. then i have to give it 10/10 with super approvel. This was a star wars movie, and a fucking good one!","displayName":"Martin B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10213388980972008/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:22:45.804Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:22:54.573Z","user":{"userId":"976954896","realm":"RT","displayName":"Martin B","accountLink":"/user/id/976954896"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Rushed plot, retcon after retcon.
