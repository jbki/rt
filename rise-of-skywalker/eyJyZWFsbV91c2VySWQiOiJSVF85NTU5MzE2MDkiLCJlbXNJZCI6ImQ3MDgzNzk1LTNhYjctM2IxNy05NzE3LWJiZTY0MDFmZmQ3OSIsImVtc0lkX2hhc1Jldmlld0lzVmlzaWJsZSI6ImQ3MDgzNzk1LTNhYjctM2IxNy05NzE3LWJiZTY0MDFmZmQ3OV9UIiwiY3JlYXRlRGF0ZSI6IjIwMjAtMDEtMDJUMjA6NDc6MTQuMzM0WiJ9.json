It ignores a majority of The Last Jedi to bring it back in line to what a Star Wars film should be. The main characters all get the screen time they deserve and characters that weren't good in The Last Jedi are great! As expected, the visuals are top notch and the music is the best it's ever been. The pacing is fast but I don't have an issue with that because there's so much in this movie. I'm glad JJ Abrams was able to give us a satisfying conclusion, especially after The Last Jedi.","displayName":"Isaiah L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1679743282/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T20:36:45.560Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T20:36:47.186Z","user":{"userId":"921194303","realm":"RT","displayName":"Isaiah L","accountLink":"/user/id/921194303"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Full of surprises.

The first half seemed more decent but still...Rey is faaaar too powerful and perfect, no struggle at all and she never fails (unlike Luke) so she kinda feels not real or human. Palpatine seems forced in just to buy fans back and makes all the sacrifices made by Luke, Anakin and pretty much everyone in the old movies kinda irrelevant.\nPlot makes no sense at all, the pacing is BAD, everything happens way too fast. Also...blowing up things again? SO.MANY.PLOT.HOLES.!\nStill a little better than The Last Jedi....but it's kinda like saying piss is better than shit.","displayName":"Daniele B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/699956013493164/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2020-01-02T20:34:30.086Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T20:34:54.201Z","user":{"userId":"975678706","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniele B","accountLink":"/user/id/975678706"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The last 35-45 nimutes was too rushed.
