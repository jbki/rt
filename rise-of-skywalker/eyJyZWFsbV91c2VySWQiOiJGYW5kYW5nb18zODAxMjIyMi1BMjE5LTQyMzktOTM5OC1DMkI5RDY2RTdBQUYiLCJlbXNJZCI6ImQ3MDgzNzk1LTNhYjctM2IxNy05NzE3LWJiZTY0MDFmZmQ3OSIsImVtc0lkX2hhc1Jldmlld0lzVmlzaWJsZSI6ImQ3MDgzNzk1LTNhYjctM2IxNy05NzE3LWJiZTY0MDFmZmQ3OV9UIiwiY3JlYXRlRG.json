They played it safe in the ways they did not need to, but went wild outfield in ways that risk old fans and new ones.  If not for the need to compare it to the prequels, it might have got only 3 stars.  That said, the movie is still great Star Wars style fun and ends well all things considered.","displayName":"Kristopher A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T18:31:41.906Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T18:31:41.906Z","user":{"userId":"ce16b8f1-4cb9-4e0c-8db4-028c87db6875","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kristopher A","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"There were some great moments but I felt it relied really heavily on nostalgia to make the movie good.
