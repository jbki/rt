Did disney spend 6 million to purchase Lucasfilm so that they could rip off The Last Airbender? Nothing original to see in this movie. The story is poorly written and as the other two movies in this trilogy, they hope to cover it up by wowing the audience with either CGI, a neck breaking pace, or social commentary. I couldn't really tell what the overall story was meant to convey in this trilogy. It was just a bunch of MMO style quests made into a movie. I think disney is buying tickets and reviews. Bottom line; If you can't make a movie that is good, then make a movie that is long.","displayName":"D M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T13:16:22.378Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T13:16:30.447Z","user":{"userId":"977716272","realm":"RT","displayName":"D M","accountLink":"/user/id/977716272"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie, go in with an open mind and don't listen to the detractors.
