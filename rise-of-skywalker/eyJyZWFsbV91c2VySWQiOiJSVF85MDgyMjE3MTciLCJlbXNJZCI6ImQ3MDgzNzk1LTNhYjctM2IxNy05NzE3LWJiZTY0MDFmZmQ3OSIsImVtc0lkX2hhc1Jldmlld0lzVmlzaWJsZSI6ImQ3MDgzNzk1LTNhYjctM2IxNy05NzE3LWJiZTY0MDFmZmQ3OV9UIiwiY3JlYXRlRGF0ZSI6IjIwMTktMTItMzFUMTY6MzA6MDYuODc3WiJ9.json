This movie and the previous two of the new trilogy can't be considered the ending of the saga we all know and love. This movie just destroys everything George Lucas created in terms of characters, their behaviours and their backround stories and shouldn't be considered as Star Wars at all. It's a lazy written, unforgivable movie with no inspiration, which just tears down all the  Star Wars universe. \nHave you ever thought that this was meant to be the conclusion of 40 years long Skywalker's story guys in Disney, and this mess was all you could think of? It's a shame.\nAnd it's even worse thinking there are people happy with this new trilogy.","displayName":"Michele N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10216629892608394/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T16:21:39.007Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T16:21:51.450Z","user":{"userId":"978494498","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michele N","accountLink":"/user/id/978494498"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"}]}
