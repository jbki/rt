The original trilogy as a teen, the prequels obviously much older, and I was amped to see the sequel trilogy with my own kids. The Force Awakens was... not without issues, but I was happy to defer judgement to see if the story went anywhere. And it did! Straight into the dumpster-fire-previously-known-as The Last Jedi (TLJ).\n \nBut this is about The Rise of Skywalker (TROS), and TROS is better than TLJ. But that's kinda like comparing having beloved childhood memories crapped on by t-rex with gastro, or torn apart by the same t-rex. Either way, those memories are never going to be the same. \n\nI'm still a Star Wars fan. I hope Disney either sell the rights to someone who gives a damn about Star Wars as something other than a way to sell lunchboxes or decides that films - even big-budget ones - need a good story and characters we movie-goers can care about. They have the money and know how, the only question is whether they have the desire.","displayName":"Chris C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000438138976/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-27T11:45:29.188Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T11:12:37.060Z","user":{"userId":"907302364","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris C","accountLink":"/user/id/907302364"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Disney killed my favorite saga","displayName":"Valtiel L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T11:43:27.793Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T11:43:35.428Z","user":{"userId":"978483085","realm":"RT","displayName":"Valtiel L","accountLink":"/user/id/978483085"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely loved it!!!
