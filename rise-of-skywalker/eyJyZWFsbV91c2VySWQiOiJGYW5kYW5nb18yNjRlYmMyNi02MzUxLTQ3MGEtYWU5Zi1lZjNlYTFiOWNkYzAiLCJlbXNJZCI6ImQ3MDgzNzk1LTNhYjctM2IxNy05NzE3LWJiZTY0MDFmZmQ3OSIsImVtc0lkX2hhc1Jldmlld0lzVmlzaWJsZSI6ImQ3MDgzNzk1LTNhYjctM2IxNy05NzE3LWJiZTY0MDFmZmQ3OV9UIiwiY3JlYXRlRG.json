So much stock footage of Carrie Fisher was used, that it felt like the first 40 minutes was written specifically around those cutting room floor clips, and a sound track was just thrown in to cover it.    Sadly the rest of the movie didn't recover, although it did try its best.  Graphically, it's Starwars on a big screen, amazing eye candy as always.  Sadly the first third was so bad to me, I had a hard time letting go and getting immersed in the story.  This one fell below phantom menace for me.","displayName":"Michael","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T20:24:59.110Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T20:24:59.110Z","user":{"userId":"1c2a3879-fe24-4e24-9491-ea5ffcd1eadd","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Okay really hard for it to come to an end.","displayName":"Ram","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T20:24:19.517Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T20:24:19.517Z","user":{"userId":"A296EDBC-1D19-45F1-99D7-709E7128C22E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ram","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"}]}
