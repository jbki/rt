No logic, no sense, Deus Ex Machina every 5 minutes. It shits on everything established on the saga so far from the original 6 films universe.\nEverything happens because it is \"convenient\", no explanation, nothing. Just because yes. A lot of special effects and it becomes boring AF due to all these nonsense and the destruction of all the known Star Wars filmographic universe. \nI wish it was all a dream and the Star Wars saga ended with the Return of the Jedi...","displayName":"Luis Ignacio R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:25:56.956Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:25:56.956Z","user":{"userId":"978489748","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luis Ignacio R","accountLink":"/user/id/978489748"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Love the movie!
