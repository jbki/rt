The Leia footage blended nicely and looked like it was supposed to  e there.  Nice cameos and surprises.  Decent story, though it seemed like some stuff was cut thin for time constraints.  Honestly don't understand all the uproar/outrage.  It's a fing move.  Nobody , including Abrams, got what they wanted from this film.  I loved it anyway.  And I'd really like to see the Abrams cut if it's that different.
