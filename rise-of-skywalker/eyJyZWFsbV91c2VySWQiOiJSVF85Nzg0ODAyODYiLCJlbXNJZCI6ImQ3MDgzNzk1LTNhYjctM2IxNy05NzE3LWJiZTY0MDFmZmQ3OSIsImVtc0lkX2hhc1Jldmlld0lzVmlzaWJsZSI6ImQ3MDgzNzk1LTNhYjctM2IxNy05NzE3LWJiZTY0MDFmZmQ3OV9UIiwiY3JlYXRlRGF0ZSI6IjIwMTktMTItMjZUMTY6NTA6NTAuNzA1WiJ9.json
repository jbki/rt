Perhaps YOU are the ones who should watch Star Wars again.  It is Bendemption.  It is reverse Anidala.  It is EVERYTHING you wanted in the final Star Wars movie.  Whereas Anakin Skywalker allowed his love to die as he fought for the Emperor,  Ben Solo fought with his love against the emperor. \n Ben Solo died, just like a redeemed Anakin Skywalker before him, saving the person he loved from death.  We all know you're upset that Ben died.  We get it.  We're upset too.  But you obviously haven't been listening during previous Star Wars movies (or this one)!  Leia said \"Nothing is impossible\".  Luke said \"No one's ever really gone\".  Han said \"Kylo Ren is dead.  My son is alive\".   Take a chill pill.  Relax.  See it again and enjoy the kiss, the brilliant smile, and the sacrifice Ben Solo made for his one and only love.  Then leave knowing that Ben Solo will be back.  Or leave bitter and angry.  It's up to you.","displayName":"Melissa S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:50:17.549Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:50:22.145Z","user":{"userId":"975572260","realm":"RT","displayName":"Melissa S","accountLink":"/user/id/975572260"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved The ending when Ray decides her own future by naming herself!","displayName":"Vicky  M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:50:04.097Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:32:43.668Z","user":{"userId":"95810e91-12e4-433c-a938-316dc3d2a297","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Vicky  M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best in the series in my opinion.
