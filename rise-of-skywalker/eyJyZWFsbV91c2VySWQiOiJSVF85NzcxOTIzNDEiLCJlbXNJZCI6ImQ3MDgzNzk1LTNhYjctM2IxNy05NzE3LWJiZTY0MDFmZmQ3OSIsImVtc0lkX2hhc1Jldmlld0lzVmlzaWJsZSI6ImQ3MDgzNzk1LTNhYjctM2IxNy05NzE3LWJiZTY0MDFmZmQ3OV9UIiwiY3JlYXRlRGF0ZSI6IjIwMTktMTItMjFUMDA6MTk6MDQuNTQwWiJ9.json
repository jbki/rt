This is an imperfect and a great conclusion to the saga. They did a great job blending the old with the new and I love the cameos. A lot going on here for sure but I think the story lines and finale are great. We will miss our beloved Princess, Han Luke, CPO, R2D2, Lando and Chewy! Thank you so much George Lucas through JJ Abrams for all of it. Well done!
