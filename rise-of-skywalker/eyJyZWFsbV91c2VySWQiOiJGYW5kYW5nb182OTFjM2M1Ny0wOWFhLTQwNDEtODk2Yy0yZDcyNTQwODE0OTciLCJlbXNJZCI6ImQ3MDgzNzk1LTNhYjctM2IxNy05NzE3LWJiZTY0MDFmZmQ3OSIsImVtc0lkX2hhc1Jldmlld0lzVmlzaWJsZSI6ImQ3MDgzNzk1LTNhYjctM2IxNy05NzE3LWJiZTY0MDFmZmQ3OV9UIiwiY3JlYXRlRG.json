You already know the story. A few new details, but scandalously ripped of from their own franchise. Even the evil emperor is dragged up again. That having been said, the action is spectacular, the imagery beautiful and the actors enjoyable. And hey, it's star wars. It's the universe that attracts us, so you want to see it. But I honestly think they're about done with the resistance vs empire storyline now.

Special effects were amazing. Fight scenes were ones to remember. Plot kinda bothered me at first but the more I thought about it, it did fit in and was the right ending for the sky walkers putting there work in to bring peace to the galaxy.
