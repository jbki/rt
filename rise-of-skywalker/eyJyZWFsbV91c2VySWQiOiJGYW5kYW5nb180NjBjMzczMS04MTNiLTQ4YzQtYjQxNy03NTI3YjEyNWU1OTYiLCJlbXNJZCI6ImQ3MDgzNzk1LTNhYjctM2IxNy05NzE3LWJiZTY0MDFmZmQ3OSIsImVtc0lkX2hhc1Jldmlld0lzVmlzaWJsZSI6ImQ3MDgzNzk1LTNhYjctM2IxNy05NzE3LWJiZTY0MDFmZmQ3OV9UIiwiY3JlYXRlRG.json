( The Last Jedi ). WAY BETTER ! I'll definitely say that ! That being said. 3.5 stars out of 5. The last one (The Last Jedi ) was like a 2 stars at best and probably the very worst of all of them in my opinion and that's me being nice. The only thing I dislike about some of the Star Wars movies are the silly CHEESY celebrations at the end. Maybe because I'm an adult and not a kid. It just makes it a bit too campy for me. Ironically the best ones in my opinion were the ones without the cheesy celebrations at the end. Empire Strikes Back, Attack of the Clones, Revenge or the Sith, Force Awakens, and even Rogue One and Solo to me were better than A New Hope, Return of the Jedi, Phantom Menace, and certainly The Last Jedi. I know my opinion may be blasphemy for a lot of you Star Wars fanatics but that's why we all have opinions. I would rank Rise of Skywalker somewhere in the middle but certainly the best one of all the ones that had the cheesy celebrations at the end. I did like the interesting twists and turns in Rise of Skywalker. It was certainly very entertaining. Had a bit of a dark feel to it which I liked. The plot was certainly interesting and a bit unexpected, but in a good way. It's no worse than 3 stars but no better than 4 stars. Certainly worth the time though! And for those who said it was too long, really?. All the Star Wars movies have been about the same length. Usually around 2 and a half hours. If they had knocked out the cheesy celebration near the end the movie it would have been shorter time wise. Just sayin'.  I still definitely recommend it.","displayName":"Anthony C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-25T15:15:25.959Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T15:34:12.645Z","user":{"userId":"978477008","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anthony C","accountLink":"/user/id/978477008"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Definitely the funniest star wars of the 9 movies, action packed with some suspense.
