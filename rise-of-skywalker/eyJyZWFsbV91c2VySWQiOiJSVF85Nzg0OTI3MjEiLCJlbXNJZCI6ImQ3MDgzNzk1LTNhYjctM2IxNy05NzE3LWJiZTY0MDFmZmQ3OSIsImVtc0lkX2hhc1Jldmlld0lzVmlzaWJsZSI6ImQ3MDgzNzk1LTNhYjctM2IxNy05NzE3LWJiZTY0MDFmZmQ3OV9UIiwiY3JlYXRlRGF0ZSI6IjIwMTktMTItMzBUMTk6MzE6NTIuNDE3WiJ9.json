Better than The Last Jedi, and slightly more exciting than The Force Awakens. However, there are some things I'm not sure about.\n-The movie was REALLY fast paced, and we barely got a chance to process what was happening. \n-There was one time where we were told that a certain character is dead, but is revealed to be OK 5 minutes later, so it kinda got us upset for nothing.\n-The main antagonist, one who is EXTREMELY powerful with the Force, died far too easily in my opinion. \n-The ending was a bit disappointing, and I left the theater with a lot of questions about it.\nOther than that, it's a pretty good ending to the Skywalker Saga, and I'd definitely recommend it and watch it again.","displayName":"Aidan N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:28:59.510Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:31:26.324Z","user":{"userId":"978492705","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aidan N","accountLink":"/user/id/978492705"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Time passed while I watched the movie and the jokes were solid. This is the bulk of its redeeming qualities.\n\nYou will probably not hate this movie so long as you aren't super invested in the storytelling of the Star Wars saga.

I always say never read reviews for movies you are really looking forward to seeing. That being said, this movie delivered exactly what I wanted. Was it perfect....no. Was it entertaining...absolutely. Please all of you stop micromanaging this movie for what it might not have delivered and honor it for what it did. At least I didn't have to see Jar Jar Binks. It was a fitting ending to a history that taught me so much about making the right choices when they were the toughest. \n\nEnjoy this movie!!!!!","displayName":"MATTHEW P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:27:14.913Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:27:14.913Z","user":{"userId":"978492697","realm":"RT","displayName":"MATTHEW P","accountLink":"/user/id/978492697"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"maybe the best of the 9","displayName":"Olivier D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/756804692/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:27:10.297Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:27:22.885Z","user":{"userId":"805661158","realm":"RT","displayName":"Olivier D","accountLink":"/user/id/805661158"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good fan service, plenty of plot holes but good action and a good enough ending storyline.","displayName":"Alex G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/113172759340263/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:27:07.595Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:27:13.684Z","user":{"userId":"976581547","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex G","accountLink":"/user/id/976581547"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"insanely rushed and convoluted, but really fun and emotionally charged. not the best movie, but pretty satisfying.","displayName":"zach s","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:25:45.595Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:25:51.529Z","user":{"userId":"978349898","realm":"RT","displayName":"zach s","accountLink":"/user/id/978349898"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Good movie in Star Wars franchise, but awful ending and closure for Skywalker saga.","displayName":"Bojan P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1355610830/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:24:13.303Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:24:20.365Z","user":{"userId":"842141871","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bojan P","accountLink":"/user/id/842141871"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's an awesome movie and if you were lucky enough to miss the last Jedi it still makes perfect sense!","displayName":"Ryan B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1570028389755816/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T19:23:07.896Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T19:23:47.590Z","user":{"userId":"976924771","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan B","accountLink":"/user/id/976924771"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"About what I expected.
