The series has lost it's mojo to me. I can see why hard core fans find enough to like and casual fans (like me) can find plenty not to like. I was sort of looking at my watch about 2/3rds through and I knew how everything was going to end. The Star Wars franchise has become more like Marvel movies and honestly the writing has seriously deteriorated. These is nothing new or interesting that makes sense and the Force is anything you want it to be for any episode. It's no longer about enlightenment but simply superpowers. If they do any future movies it will likely be rentals for me. Too bad.","displayName":"MovieGuy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T15:31:23.662Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T15:31:23.662Z","user":{"userId":"244280d8-9d3d-44e4-b17f-3930a0458bca","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"MovieGuy","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This movie was great. The visuals were absolutely stunning, and the story of the movie didn’t feel forced or boring. The only thing that would have possibilities made this movie better was if George Lucas himself was directing the movie.
