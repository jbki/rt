The newer franchise has been a bit of a rough ride but would contend the last 40-60 minutes of RoS made the journey worthwhile.  Is it perfectly executed?  no.  Plot holes and rushed story lines?  sure. However, the core elements are present and JJ relies on the Star Wars fan to forgive where necessary but I didn't feel \"taken advantage of\" in this way.","displayName":"Michael D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:21:14.350Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:21:14.350Z","user":{"userId":"e5b0444c-6597-4cf4-bac5-cb171b5b7adb","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael D","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A satisfying movie for Star Wars fans. JJ's task had a high degree of difficulty - create a compelling story with old footage of Carrie Fisher, solve plot points at odds with each other because of TFA and TLJ, and honor three trilogies. The Rise of Skywalker isn't perfect, but it gives fans who have supported the Star Wars universe for 4 decades fun and poignant moments with old and new characters. I thought the end of Leia's story was fulfilling - defining her as a Master Jedi. The relationship between Rey and Kylo had a great pay off. The chemistry between Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley was easily the best part of the new trilogy. The Rise of Skywalker addressed the point of lineage and bloodline - a theme throughout the 9 movies. Family is who we choose and we are not predestined by blood.","displayName":"Brian R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10153801905959036/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:20:53.482Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:21:00.593Z","user":{"userId":"972914158","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian R","accountLink":"/user/id/972914158"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Good story / plot and a  few surprises graphics as usual were amazing especially in 4d.","displayName":"daniel r","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:20:48.815Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:20:48.815Z","user":{"userId":"5c129fde-388e-4dd7-8ac4-aac552f3f25f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"daniel r","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It's not surprising that most of the professional critics used in the official amalgamated score came to this movie with a pre-sharpened axe to grind. There's something about this series that carries so much baggage with it that makes it almost impossible to get an unbiased evaluation. Or, as unbiased as human beings can strive for, at least. \n\nLet's just get this up front: this movie does not deserve the sub-60 score that it currently has here. Is it a perfect movie? No, but very few are. Does it do what it sets out to do, and in an entertaining fashion? Without question! Yes, there are a few dangling subplots that are never resolved, but those aren't really relevant to the main story. But this movie also has moments of real emotional impact, despite all the click-hungry \"sour\" reviews calling it \"soulless\", which is just ridiculous on its face. The visual spectacle that Abrams painted is truly a sight to behold in and of itself. Some of the best cinematographic shots can be found in this movie, composed with a painter's eye and matched with the unparalleled aural magic that is the final John Williams Star Wars score.\n\nA Star Wars movie always provides a perfect Rorschach test when it comes to the reviewers. Much like the cave in Empire, or the pit in Last Jedi, reviewers usually end up writing Star Wars reviews based on what they've brought with them. And truly, it may be impossible not to, after 42 years. But don't be fooled into thinking that their experience is going to be your experience. The critic/audience ratio is proof of that. Don't believe the score. Believe in your own judgment.","displayName":"John M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:20:38.910Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:20:48.906Z","user":{"userId":"836975775","realm":"RT","displayName":"John M","accountLink":"/user/id/836975775"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Everything about this movie works for me except the most important part: The story.
