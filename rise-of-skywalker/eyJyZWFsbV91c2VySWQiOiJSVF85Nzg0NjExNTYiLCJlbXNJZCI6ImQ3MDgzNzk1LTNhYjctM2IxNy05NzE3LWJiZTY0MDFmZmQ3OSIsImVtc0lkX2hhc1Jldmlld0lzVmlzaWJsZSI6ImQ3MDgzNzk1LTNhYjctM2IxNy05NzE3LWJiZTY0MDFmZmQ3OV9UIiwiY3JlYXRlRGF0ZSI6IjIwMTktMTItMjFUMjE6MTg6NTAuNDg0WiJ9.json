What I saw was the best star wars movie ever made... It’s like people haven’t seen the other Star Wars. This one had the coolest villain, the best fight scene, the most emotional moments. They did try to fit a lot in the movie. I do think perhaps it could have been 2 movies, but with the installment of this movie; the Skywalker saga is officially the best trilogy in the Star Wars universe.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:18:13.726Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:18:13.726Z","user":{"userId":"972570828","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/972570828"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I am a casual SW fan of 30+ years. I watched the film this morning and I enjoyed it enough to be satisfied. There were good story thread tie-ups that the screenplay writers introduced with The Force Awakens, but also with two or three threads falling flat. There was also a major gap in universe logic regarding the return of a certain antagonist. I don't need to see the movie more than once in theaters, but was entertained for the two and a half hours.","displayName":"Joe M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/834896763636496/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:18:12.477Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:18:17.917Z","user":{"userId":"978461131","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joe M","accountLink":"/user/id/978461131"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Half the source material was lifted from Return of the Jedi.
