I saw the movie twice because as a fan of the franchise I wanted to give this movie a chance but this movie was terrible. Too much fan service was given and was all a manipulation of those who love the franchise. Its entertaining at times and the visuals are good along with great performances from the cast but aside from that the story is horrible! This movie is just a huge apology for a small but vocal minority that did not like The Last Jedi and trying to please the fans by shrinking the universe to the faces everyone has seen growing up. Very disappointed. What made star wars special and a sentiment that was echoed in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi is that a nobody can be a somebody and change the destiny of an entire galaxy. This movie throws all that in the trash and tells the fans \"screw this, we will give all you reddit star wars fan a shot to write the script for the new star wars movie! There you happy?!\" Very Very horrible. Save yourself the trouble and watch the prequels which are way better than this garbage.","displayName":"Josue F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-26T17:43:05.388Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T17:43:05.388Z","user":{"userId":"978480412","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josue F","accountLink":"/user/id/978480412"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Good movie and enjoyable.
