Too many macguffins. Too many loose ends and half storylines in this, not just from Episode VIII but from within the movie itself. Too many peripheral characters and not enough focus on the story. Messy, irrational, illogical. Makes the whole trilogy a waste of time. Positives? Some good action, one or two laughs and a good cast who have been let down by disastrous oversight on the Producers' part.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T22:27:48.635Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T22:29:33.434Z","user":{"userId":"948866689","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/948866689"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"6h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved how the series was wrapped up!","displayName":"Amber G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T22:26:08.029Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T22:26:08.029Z","user":{"userId":"2a4c6058-8a50-4cda-a6b9-8bf2ec54f596","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Amber G","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"So they wont verify it because I didn't buy the ticket.  Full disclosure I liked last jedi first time around but after a couple more views I think it's the worst of the series.  Expectations were low for this but I walked away reasonably entertained.  The effects were good as expected, acting overall was solid.  I honestly felt like Lando, Leia, & Palpatine were shoehorned in.  As some have mentioned there were some unresolved plot lines that will never be finished.  Given what they had to work with I think they did a solid job.","displayName":"Joshua K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T22:25:20.117Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T22:25:26.301Z","user":{"userId":"919105274","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joshua K","accountLink":"/user/id/919105274"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"6h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a true Star Wars saga, with all the feels of the original three.","displayName":"intlspy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T22:24:11.663Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T22:24:11.663Z","user":{"userId":"71BE69D0-B224-41E9-82DB-42B9FFA5BD6B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"intlspy","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie was bad because it had to follow the last Jedi, and fix what they broke.
