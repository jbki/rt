It recalled some fun lore, it built new pieces for us to go \"OHHH\" about, the music and effects were incredible, some characters were given more proper backstories, others were appropriately put the backburner, and so much more. I could go on for some time. Is it the best film in franchise? In my opionion, no, but it is a damn good addition to round out an incredible epic.","displayName":"Robert B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1070815606281108/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-27T18:24:15.455Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T18:24:21.185Z","user":{"userId":"978484231","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert B","accountLink":"/user/id/978484231"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I created an account on this site just to give this movie a bad review. This was a spit in the face to Star Wars fans and one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was unimaginative and pandered to the lowest expectations we could have at all for this movie. I was so excited for Palpatine and they ruined that too. This movie doesn't even make sense.","displayName":"Jackson A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T18:23:17.829Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T16:58:15.520Z","user":{"userId":"978484222","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jackson A","accountLink":"/user/id/978484222"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie brought it all back for me from the beginning in the '70's.
