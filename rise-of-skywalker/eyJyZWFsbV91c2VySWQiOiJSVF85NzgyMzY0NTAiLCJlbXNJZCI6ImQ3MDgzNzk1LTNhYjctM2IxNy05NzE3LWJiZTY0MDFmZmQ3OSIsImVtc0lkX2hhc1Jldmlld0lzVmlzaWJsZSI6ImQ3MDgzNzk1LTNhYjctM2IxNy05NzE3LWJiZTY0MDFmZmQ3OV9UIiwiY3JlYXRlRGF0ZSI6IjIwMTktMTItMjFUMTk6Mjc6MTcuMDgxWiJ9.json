I was expecting this movie to feel simple. I really enjoyed this movie it was more than I expected. Even though we had carrie Fishers passing I didn't feel the unused scenes of her were bad at all. As someone as many who loves the star wars lore and the whole universe I felt immersed with so much. No movie is perfect and as so I go against critics because it's all limited to our capabilities.

I am glad JJ was able to come back and end it  the wat he had planned. It was a very fun movie and I felt like it kept going at a good pace unlike the previous film. The homage to Leia and Carrie Fisher made me shed a tear. It was a really emotional movie for me and I am glad it was a satisfying experience!","displayName":"Will M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/628474934/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T19:26:12.244Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T19:26:23.798Z","user":{"userId":"972681919","realm":"RT","displayName":"Will M","accountLink":"/user/id/972681919"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Sooo good!
