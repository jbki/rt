What I got was a convoluted mess that was lacking in emotional resonance. I left feeling cheated and disheartened. I was willing to forgive almost every error this film made until the final minutes. The omission of a major character, and not even showing anyone else giving him a second thought was insulting not only to him but to every other beloved character that had made a sacrifice in his behalf. \nI have the highest respect for the actors involved. They made me truly love their characters. They were the heart and soul of these movies. And they deserved better. ALL of them. JJ Abrams and whoever else was calling the shots on the ending of this film should be ashamed of themselves.","displayName":"Amber V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T23:31:56.016Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T23:32:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"976936800","realm":"RT","displayName":"Amber V","accountLink":"/user/id/976936800"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Action packed!!!

It was too concerned with retconning what was done in the two previous films that we didn't get the satisfying ending that we wanted. Seriously, the ending was terrible and did not leave me feeling hopeful when it was over. There was never a moment to breath or cry - which can be good to some but bad for others (bad to me). Like other star wars films, the action was there and was fun to watch. I wish there were more movies coming, as the film didn't feel complete.","displayName":"Danni B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2826861787334907/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T23:30:15.310Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T23:30:50.979Z","user":{"userId":"978478132","realm":"RT","displayName":"Danni B","accountLink":"/user/id/978478132"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"We went to see Star Wars in IMAX and loved it.
