The spectacle is alright but you do not end up with the feels, the emotion that you do when exiting one of the original movies. At the end of the day... It's hard to see a young inspirational man's vision so full of life ending in such an okay and unthrilling piece if broken, shattered creative idea, which was sucked of all it's life by Disney just for another buck.","displayName":"Leopold S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:28:12.688Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:28:20.139Z","user":{"userId":"976727161","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leopold S","accountLink":"/user/id/976727161"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is fantastic.","displayName":"Krzysztof K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/596907404400962/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:28:10.355Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:28:56.909Z","user":{"userId":"978452920","realm":"RT","displayName":"Krzysztof K","accountLink":"/user/id/978452920"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"you would think 300 million dollars is enough to have qualified screenwriters check the script to point out its issues but apparently not","displayName":"June D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1445872472236014/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:28:07.918Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:28:22.046Z","user":{"userId":"978452918","realm":"RT","displayName":"June D","accountLink":"/user/id/978452918"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"So many tears, so satisfied with the resolution of the story.
