It is, thankfully, not the disrespectful piece of garbage that was Episode 8. It was fun and, as always, well made. \n\nHowever, the fact that you can basically pretend 8 never existed is a sad testament to the mess that is the sequel trilogy. Ironically, in many ways, Episode IX is the cinematic version of the Dark Empire series of comics from the early 1990s, a series which was quite divisive in its day. \n\nAnyway, if you see it, you will probably enjoy it, assuming you can shut off your brain and not ask too many questions.","displayName":"Shawn M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10153352715079716/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:04:05.301Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:04:08.699Z","user":{"userId":"972648006","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shawn M","accountLink":"/user/id/972648006"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best way to end this saga!!","displayName":"diane s","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:03:03.421Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:03:03.421Z","user":{"userId":"18F7F68A-C0A7-4078-A639-C66DD3C1F413","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"diane s","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Kylo Ren actually died from exhaustion from carrying everyone in this movie.","displayName":"Anthony  J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:01:55.360Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:02:01.634Z","user":{"userId":"978475340","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anthony  J","accountLink":"/user/id/978475340"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"it was a great closing for a great epic storyline...thanks","displayName":"Eric","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:01:52.998Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:01:52.998Z","user":{"userId":"80C9CF6A-1EFE-4DCC-961B-AA3ECD5EFC22","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Eric","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"even at 2.5 hours, felt rushed","displayName":"Eli","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:01:09.943Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:01:09.943Z","user":{"userId":"ABE53DE7-F14A-4BA7-B669-AB63282BD770","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Eli","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I was disappointed and frustrated with episode 8 (as were all Star Wars fans, except for the critics.
