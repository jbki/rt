But for some reason lately if they are down on a movie I wind up liking it, and that is the case here. Does it dot every I or cross every T? No, but after 42 years, what movie could? I really enjoyed it, even the 3 times it brought tears to my eyes. This movie closes the circle for me. Luke , Leia and Han have been with me all these years, and this is a fitting end to their story.","displayName":"Bear H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000039608270/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:47:00.327Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T22:29:32.732Z","user":{"userId":"886376004","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bear H","accountLink":"/user/id/886376004"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
