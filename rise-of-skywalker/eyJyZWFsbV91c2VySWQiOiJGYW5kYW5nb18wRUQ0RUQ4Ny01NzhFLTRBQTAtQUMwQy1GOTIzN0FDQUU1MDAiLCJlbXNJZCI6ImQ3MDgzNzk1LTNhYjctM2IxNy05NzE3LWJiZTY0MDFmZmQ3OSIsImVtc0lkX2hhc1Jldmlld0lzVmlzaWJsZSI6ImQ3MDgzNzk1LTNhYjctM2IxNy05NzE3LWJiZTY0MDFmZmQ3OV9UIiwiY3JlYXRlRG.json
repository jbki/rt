They really did a good job wrapping up the various storylines in a satisfying and at times tear-jerking fashion.  Can't say much else without spoiling the plot but it makes some of the strange plot lines in The Last Jedi make more sense and ends the Skywalker saga the right way.","displayName":"Chris D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T19:51:27.524Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T19:51:27.524Z","user":{"userId":"6e40fa63-e2b9-42b5-85db-3dfb03b4cb41","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chris D","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"More fun than should be legal!  This was fabulous, spectacular, amazing, wonderful!   Thank you JJ Abrams for resolving all the conflicts and bringing us peace.

Some amazing scenes Star Wars fans will love. Movie wouldn't work well as a stand-alone film, which is most likely the reason for the critic score.
