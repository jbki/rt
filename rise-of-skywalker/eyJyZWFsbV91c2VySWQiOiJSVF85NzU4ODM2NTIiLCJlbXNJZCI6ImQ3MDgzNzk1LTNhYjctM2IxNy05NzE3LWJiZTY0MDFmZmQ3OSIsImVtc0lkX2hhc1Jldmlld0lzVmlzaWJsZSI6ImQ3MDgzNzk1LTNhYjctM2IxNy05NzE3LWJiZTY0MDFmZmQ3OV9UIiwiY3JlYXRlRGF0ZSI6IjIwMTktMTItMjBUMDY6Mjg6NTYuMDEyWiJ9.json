JJ Abrams redeems the franchise and gives the fans a movie that allows them to let the Skywalker saga complete with satisfaction. This is no game of thrones final episode and could arguably be a favorite of many fans. At times this movie moves very fast and lacks the time to absorb the emotion of the scene, but that is to be expected when 49 years of Star Wars needs to come to a conclusion in 2.5 hours. Will be seeing again.","displayName":"Callan M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/506650187/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:28:51.863Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:28:57.931Z","user":{"userId":"799259403","realm":"RT","displayName":"Callan M","accountLink":"/user/id/799259403"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I don’t know if it was because Disney had some sort of talk with mrs Kennedy or something but this movie wasn’t that bad. JJ abrams obviously had his work cut out for him but if you go into this movie excepting that Rey will be over powered to the extreme and can and will beat the greatest sith ever. Hey at least in this movie she gets some training and actually struggles with the question of who she is and what that means. Which really help make this the best of the three. I hated the flash back of Luke and leia training but that’s ok. The three biggest comments I had to make was thank you for baby yoda introducing force healing before skywalker dying I mean rising came out. Also Disney next time call up jk Rowling and have her be in charge of keeping your ending secret because you guys really drop the ball. Lastly the skywalkers are dead her name is Rey palpatine not Rey skywalker. Let it show she isn’t afraid of her lineage anymore let her not lie to herself though the reveal was well done for those who didn’t know","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:28:51.141Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:28:51.141Z","user":{"userId":"965509191","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/965509191"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I quite enjoyed it!
