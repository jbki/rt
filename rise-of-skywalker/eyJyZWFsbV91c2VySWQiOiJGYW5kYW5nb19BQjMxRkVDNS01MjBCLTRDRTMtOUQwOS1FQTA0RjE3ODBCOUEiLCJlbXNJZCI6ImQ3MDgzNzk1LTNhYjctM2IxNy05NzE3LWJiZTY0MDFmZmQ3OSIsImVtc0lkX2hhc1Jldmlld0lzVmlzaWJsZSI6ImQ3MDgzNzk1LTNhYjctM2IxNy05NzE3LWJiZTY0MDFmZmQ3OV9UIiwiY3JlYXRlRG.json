But this did nothing for me. It was like eating. Milk toast its something to do but didn't add anything to the starwars universe. Even the prequels added to the lore and expanded the universe. This didn't add anything. Really a disappointing effort by the house of mouse. At least i can look forward to the mandalorian's next episodes","displayName":"Benjamin M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002978053695/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:11:38.089Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:11:41.443Z","user":{"userId":"941249475","realm":"RT","displayName":"Benjamin M","accountLink":"/user/id/941249475"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A great end to the Skywalker saga.
