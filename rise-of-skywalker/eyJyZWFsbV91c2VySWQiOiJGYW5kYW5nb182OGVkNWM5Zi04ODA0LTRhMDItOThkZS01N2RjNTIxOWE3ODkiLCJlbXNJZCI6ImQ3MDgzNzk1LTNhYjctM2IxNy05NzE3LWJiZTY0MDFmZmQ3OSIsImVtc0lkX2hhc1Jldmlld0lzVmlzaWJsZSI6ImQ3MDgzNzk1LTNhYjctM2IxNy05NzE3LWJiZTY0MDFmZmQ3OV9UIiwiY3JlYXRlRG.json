Having said that, this was my least favorite of all the Star Wars movies. The visuals and effects are always nice, but it rushes through the story irresponsibly and dismisses a lot of things that were built in the previous movies (even its own trilogy). Without wanting to give too much away, things all just seem to trivial, from hyperspace skipping, to overpowered force users, and obviously the First Order (what was the point of defeating the empire if it's only going to come back). There is too much emphasis on that, and not enough on the story or character development.\nAside from Star Wars, I like Abrams as a director, and I understand he had some big shoes to fill, but I think he should have allowed himself a little more freedom to tell a more original story. There's just too much concern with the franchise, and not enough with the plot.\nRogue One is an example of a great Star Wars film. It told an original story contained in the star wars universe that wasn't focused on the skywalkers (I mean, come on, in a universe that big there's only one family worthy of telling a story about?) or Jedis, and it was still great in its own way.\nI understand Star Wars itself is sort of fantastic, but this is too much. Space fighters shouldn't emit smoke from thrusters, you can't take on a giant star destroyer on horses, and again, you can't just pull yourself out of a pickle by going into hyperspace (and if you can, why didn't we see this in the previous movies?). The whole thing seems like it was smashed together by kids.","displayName":"Daniel C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T15:41:33.361Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T16:24:23.374Z","user":{"userId":"976262449","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel C","accountLink":"/user/id/976262449"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie was wonderful and sad because you knew this was the end of this part of the story with the original cast.
