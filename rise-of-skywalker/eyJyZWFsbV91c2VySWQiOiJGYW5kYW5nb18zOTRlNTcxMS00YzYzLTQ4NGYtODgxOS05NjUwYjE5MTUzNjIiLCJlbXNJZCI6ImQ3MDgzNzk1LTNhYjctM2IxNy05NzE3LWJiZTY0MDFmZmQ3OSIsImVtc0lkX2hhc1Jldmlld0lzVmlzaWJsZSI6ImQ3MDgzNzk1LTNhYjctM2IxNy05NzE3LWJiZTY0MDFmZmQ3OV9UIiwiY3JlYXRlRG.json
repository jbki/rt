Why are Storm Troopers so stupid and easy to kill? What is the purpose of their silly plastic armor that does absolutely nothing for them? I thought they were clones, but that seemed to change. Why do Jedi powers vary so much?  And why are they used differently depending on the movie? Couldn't Darth Vader use the Force to bring the space ship that escaped with the Death Star plans on Rogue One the way Rey used it to control the space shuttle that supposedly had Chewy in Rise of Skywalker? How come no one eats, drinks, or sleeps during any of the movies? Why do some Jedi die and return while others never return? Really, it's just ridiculous, yet we love it so much.

JJ Abrams knows how it's done. Don't believe all those 'critics reviews' that are negative. I mean, who would you rather believe? Someone who doesn't get paid to write something or someone who gets paid to write a certain way, like a 'movie critic'?\nAnyway, this movie is a fitting end to the latest Star Wars trilogy, with a great female lead, a satisfying script and great production value. If you think that previous movie by Rian Johnson was drab and lacking, you will be pleasantly surprised by this one.
