Nothing spectacular, the title is very misleading only to sell tickets, has some really good parts and then it even has some very bad parts. Disney and JJ makes sure to let you know they do not care about canon and George Lucas's storeylines.

Fundamentally and at its core it had it, but the execution was poor and left you feeling unsatisfied. As a long time Star Wars fan, I feel like J.J. Abrams knew what he was doing, but the atrocity that was The Last Jedi caused him to have to crush his ideas into a 2 hour time frame. The ideas and concepts that needed time to develop didn't hit as intended, and in the end I left feeling like this movie was the intended episode VIII and IX crammed into one.","displayName":"Anthony D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001174392571/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:47:05.757Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:47:12.810Z","user":{"userId":"969973351","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anthony D","accountLink":"/user/id/969973351"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Some cliche, some dumb parts, but it's good for simple entertainment and fan boy story telling","displayName":"Billdo","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:46:59.854Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:46:59.854Z","user":{"userId":"E5096390-DEBF-46CE-B6C6-C87616F1FA75","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Billdo","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I loved it, I would give it a 5 star but it was a bit rushed and I felt like they should have made it a 3 hour movie to smooth things out a bit.
