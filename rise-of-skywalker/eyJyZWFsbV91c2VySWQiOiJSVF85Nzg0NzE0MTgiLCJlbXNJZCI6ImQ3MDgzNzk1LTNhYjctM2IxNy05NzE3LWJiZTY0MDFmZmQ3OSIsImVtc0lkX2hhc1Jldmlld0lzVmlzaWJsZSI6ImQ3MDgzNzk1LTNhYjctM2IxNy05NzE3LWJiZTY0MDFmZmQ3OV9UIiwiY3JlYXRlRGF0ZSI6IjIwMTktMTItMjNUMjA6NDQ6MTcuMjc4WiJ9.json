Abrams had directed all three films. This was fittingly by far the most epic of all Star Wars films. The characters continued to evolve, their motivations were believable, the plot thickened, and Luke even admits he was wrong. Some new characters were duds (the new droid D-0), but luckily there were so many strong and beloved characters that it didn't matter. I saw it in IMAX 3D and will try to see it at least once again before it leaves theaters.","displayName":"Mathew P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/735218809/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T20:44:11.918Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T20:44:16.521Z","user":{"userId":"808385005","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mathew P","accountLink":"/user/id/808385005"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie gave me TESB vibes.

It's not like we're expecting a sequel to The Tree of Life, IT'S START WARS.
