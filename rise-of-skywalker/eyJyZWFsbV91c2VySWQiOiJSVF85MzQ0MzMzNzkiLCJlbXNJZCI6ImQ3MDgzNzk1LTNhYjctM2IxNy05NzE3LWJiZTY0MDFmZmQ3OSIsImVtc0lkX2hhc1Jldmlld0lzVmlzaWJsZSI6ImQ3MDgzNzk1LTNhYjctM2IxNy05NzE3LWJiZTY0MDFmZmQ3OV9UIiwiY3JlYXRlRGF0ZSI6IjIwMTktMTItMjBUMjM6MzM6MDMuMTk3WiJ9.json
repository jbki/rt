While not a perfect movie, it was a perfect ending to the Skywalker saga. From the moment the familiar music and introductory scrawl started I was in that galaxy far far away and I didn't want it to end. JJ Abrams maximized the footage of Carrie Fisher and it felt like she was there with us for the final chapter.","displayName":"Pamela C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10219872443428534/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T23:32:29.518Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T23:32:33.801Z","user":{"userId":"978102033","realm":"RT","displayName":"Pamela C","accountLink":"/user/id/978102033"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!

They handled Leia's character as well as could be expected given her death in 2016, but the rest was first rate.  The plot worked well, the characters were very well acted and the action was, well great (after all, it is a Star Wars film.  I am sure I will see in many times again in the future.
