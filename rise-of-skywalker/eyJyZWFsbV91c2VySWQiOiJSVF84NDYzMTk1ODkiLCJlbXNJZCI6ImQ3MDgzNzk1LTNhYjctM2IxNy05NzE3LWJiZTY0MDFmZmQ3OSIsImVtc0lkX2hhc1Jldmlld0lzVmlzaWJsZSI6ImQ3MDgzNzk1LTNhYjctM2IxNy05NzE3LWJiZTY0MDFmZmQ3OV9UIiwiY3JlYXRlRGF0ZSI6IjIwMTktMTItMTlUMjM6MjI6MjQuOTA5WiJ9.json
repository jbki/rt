It is just a needless MacGuffin chase that serves to establish who these characters actually are, because none of the previous films have done so.\nThe film is very entertaining, but you cannot take it seriously. I laughed at the first sentence of the opening crawl. People asked me to quiet down, but by the last twenty minutes of the film, we were all laughing at the ridiculous choices they made at the end and unlike with previous films, audience members were leaving as soon as the title crawl appeared and they all had grim and disappointed faces. One of our movie brigade actually fell asleep during the final battle. I would not recommend seeing this film, but it is entertaining and better than The Last Jedi. There were also some cool nods to other series and previous lore from the Expanded Universe. I will also say that I didn't feel it entirely ruined the ending of Return of the Jedi for me, just because old man Palpatine is back, but in the context of this film the Original Trilogy now really feels like this dated middle trilogy that was kind of just a buffer between the prequels and the sequels, while at the same time, the prequels are almost completely ignored. I really feel like Disney Lucasfilm just tried to bury all of the George Lucas stuff with this film and end it all so they can start fresh. But for me the film is not even remotely able to redeem the Disney Trilogy. That ship has sailed and I now consider all of this new stuff fan fiction.","displayName":"Dominik K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:21:35.736Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:21:41.747Z","user":{"userId":"978440385","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dominik K","accountLink":"/user/id/978440385"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"A lack of imagination in the creation of the film with a few pieces of nostalgia to try and please the fans","displayName":"bobby m","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:21:31.319Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:21:33.472Z","user":{"userId":"978442064","realm":"RT","displayName":"bobby m","accountLink":"/user/id/978442064"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Extremely disappointing and boring.

This movie had the bag of spanners TLJ provided to fix, but the fact that yet again every character explained every plot point and Knew every answer every time it's just fundamentally poor story telling. Dreadful pacing made for a rushed movie and devastatingly weak ending to a story developed over 6.5 chapters.

Not very lively for me, there was no \"wow\" moments for me.  The movie takes no risks, and offers nothing really new to the series.  \n\nI had hoped that J.J. would find a way to mop up Rian Johnson's mess... and I can tell he tried his best with the tools he had... but it just didn't meet the mark.  I blame the failings of this movie more on Johnson than on J.J. but in the end both are complicit are lowering the standards of storytelling in the Star Wars universe.","displayName":"Jesse M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10151975290382854/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:19:42.103Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:19:52.308Z","user":{"userId":"976717975","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jesse M","accountLink":"/user/id/976717975"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great film for the fans","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:19:12.999Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T23:19:12.999Z","user":{"userId":"957147301","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/957147301"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"}]}
