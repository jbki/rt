I'm so glad I did though, this movie was Amazing. The best film of the trilogy. It did the best imaginable job of making up for the atrocity that came before it. There first part was a little rushed but it's very understandable considering all the ground it had to make up. An excellent star wars story and conclusion, with excellent fight scenes and character development that was actually enjoyable and not just annoying.","displayName":"Justin C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/531167652/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:24:45.487Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:24:52.646Z","user":{"userId":"340351085","realm":"RT","displayName":"Justin C","accountLink":"/user/id/340351085"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"If what you love about Star Wars is the mythic storytelling and the hero's journey, then you're going to love this movie (just like you probably have all the others). If you loved TLJ because it subverted the conventions of the larger story in important ways, your probably not going to be happy with this one. I think everyone who's ever watched and enjoyed Star Wars should see this at least once and try to just sit back and enjoy the end of the ride.","displayName":"Brooks T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10103473891370984/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:24:18.530Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:24:23.399Z","user":{"userId":"976932245","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brooks T","accountLink":"/user/id/976932245"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Exceeded every expectation of what I thought possible after the disaster of Episode 8","displayName":"Elijah A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/568521372/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:24:10.010Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:24:14.170Z","user":{"userId":"791010212","realm":"RT","displayName":"Elijah A","accountLink":"/user/id/791010212"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Still makes the heart race with the Jon Williams overture and with so much to cover -- it was wrapped up well.
