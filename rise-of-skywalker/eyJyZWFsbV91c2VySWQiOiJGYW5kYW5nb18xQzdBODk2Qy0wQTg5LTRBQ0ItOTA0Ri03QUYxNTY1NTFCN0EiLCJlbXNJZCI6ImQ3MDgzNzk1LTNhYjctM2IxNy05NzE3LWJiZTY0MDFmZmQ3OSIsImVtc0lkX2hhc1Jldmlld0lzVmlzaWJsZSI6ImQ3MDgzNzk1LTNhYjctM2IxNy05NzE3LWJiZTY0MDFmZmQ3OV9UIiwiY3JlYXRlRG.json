It had some plot holes but they weren’t many given that I know the extended universe such as the aftermath and the Darth Vader comics. Overall, simply phenomenal. To concede a bit I’ll admit it was a lot of hardcore fan service but it’s not like J.J. Abraham has much to work with given the problems with The Last Jedi.","displayName":"Evan W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T04:21:43.792Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T10:39:10.846Z","user":{"userId":"DEA6BB4F-BEFC-4FBB-B11C-7C81459D402E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Evan W","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I enjoyed the movie.
