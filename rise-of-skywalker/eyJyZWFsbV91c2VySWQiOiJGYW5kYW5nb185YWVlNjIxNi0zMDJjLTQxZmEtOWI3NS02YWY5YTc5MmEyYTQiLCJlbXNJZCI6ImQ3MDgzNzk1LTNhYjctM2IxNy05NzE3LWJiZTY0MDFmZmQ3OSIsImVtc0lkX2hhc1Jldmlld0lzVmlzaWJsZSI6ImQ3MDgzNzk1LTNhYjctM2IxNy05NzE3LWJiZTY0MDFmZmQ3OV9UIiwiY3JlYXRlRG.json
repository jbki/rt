Bringing back Lando and Wedge Antilles was a good move. A little inconsistency in what capabilities Jedi and Sith had. It reminded me of when I was a kid playing Star Wars with my friends and we’d always make up the story on the spot trying to one-up each other with the new greater powers we’d imagine into the existence of our game. I think some people will have a major problem with this, but as for me who grew up with this and for all the kids who think like this, it’s nostalgic. Good overall movie. Feels incomplete though...","displayName":"John F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T16:16:54.006Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T16:16:54.006Z","user":{"userId":"E24137EC-3097-46AA-A470-3B47B5B99D5F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"John F","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was just overall awesome!!","displayName":"Tricia B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T16:16:53.442Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T16:16:53.442Z","user":{"userId":"431a9221-990c-42c4-bf4c-3ae57ff7a563","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tricia B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It  was a really good 3-D movie.
