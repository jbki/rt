I found the other Star Wars movies much more different. This may be because the character Rey was the main focus in the movie which is why they are many negative reviews. However, I feel like the audience will love this movie. However, this was not shown in the film and will not be shown because this is the last film of the Skywalker saga. I strongly believe that this movie will make a lot of money just because people have already bought their tickets but they might regret it if they don't like Rey. If they love Rey, they will love this movie. This is because the movie is all about Rey.","displayName":"Islam S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1049901718702991/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:28:38.782Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:28:52.650Z","user":{"userId":"978437651","realm":"RT","displayName":"Islam S","accountLink":"/user/id/978437651"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"A horrible ending to a beloved saga. It's hard to keep track of many many mistakes were made in this film, unexplained plot points was just the start, this saga that George began was focused on Anakin as the chosen one but Disney has seemed to forget this as this trilogy changes Anakins prophecy as the chosen one as he never did bring balance but rather the grand daughter of Palpatine did. Over all this trilogy was a mistake and Disney shouldn't have tried to add or change the Skywalker saga and do something unique instead.","displayName":"William H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2280868085513682/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T22:28:32.534Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T22:30:03.415Z","user":{"userId":"978015274","realm":"RT","displayName":"William H","accountLink":"/user/id/978015274"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The movie was a pleasant finish to the Star Wars saga, emotional at some times.
