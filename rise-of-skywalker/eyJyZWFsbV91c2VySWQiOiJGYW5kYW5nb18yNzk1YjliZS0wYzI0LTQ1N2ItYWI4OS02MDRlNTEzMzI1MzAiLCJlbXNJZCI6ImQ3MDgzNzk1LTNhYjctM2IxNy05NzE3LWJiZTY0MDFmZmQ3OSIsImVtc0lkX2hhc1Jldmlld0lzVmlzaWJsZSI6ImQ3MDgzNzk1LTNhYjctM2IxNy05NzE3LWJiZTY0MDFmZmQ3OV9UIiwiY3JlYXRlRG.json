I thought the lead actress who played Rey was talented and convincing. The movie had some of the humor I remember from the other movies and it seemed like it tied the whole thing together nicely. My husband, who is a Star Wars fan, thinks that they have left openings to continue the story.","displayName":"Michelle","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T12:46:04.414Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T12:46:04.414Z","user":{"userId":"3e0b79d4-8ec5-4b76-ba7e-5d0bbb8250e3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michelle","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The action was very well done.","displayName":"Robert","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T12:45:32.870Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T12:45:32.870Z","user":{"userId":"4148ff20-ab7b-4840-b8d5-48e231342751","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Robert","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"what a croak of shite!","displayName":"Nelson M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/693566295/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2020-01-02T12:42:13.072Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T12:42:18.530Z","user":{"userId":"906351176","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nelson M","accountLink":"/user/id/906351176"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Only one thing to say, this movie does not deserve the hate it is getting. Hats off to JJ Abrams that he managed to unf**k the huge pile of dog s*** that is the last jedi. And as far as the new force powers are considered, they had to update it, it was getting boring anyway. This will surely attract new generation of star wars fans.","displayName":"Harshit P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1996922840355062/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T12:40:30.474Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T12:40:40.679Z","user":{"userId":"977793716","realm":"RT","displayName":"Harshit P","accountLink":"/user/id/977793716"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I just cant see what all these people are complaining about!
