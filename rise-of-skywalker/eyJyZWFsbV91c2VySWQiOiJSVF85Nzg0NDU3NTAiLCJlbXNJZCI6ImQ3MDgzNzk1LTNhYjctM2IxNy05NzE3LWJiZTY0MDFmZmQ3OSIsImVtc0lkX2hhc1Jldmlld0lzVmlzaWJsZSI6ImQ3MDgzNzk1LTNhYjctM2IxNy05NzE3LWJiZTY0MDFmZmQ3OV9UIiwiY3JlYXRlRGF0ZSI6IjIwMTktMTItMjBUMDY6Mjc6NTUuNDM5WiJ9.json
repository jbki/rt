Stuff just happens.  There's no real plot to be found and the pacing moves so fast, you can't blink or you'll miss a scene.  The nonsense they do ruins the original trilogy and doesn't even answer any of the questions we had from 7 or 8.  I left the theater shaking with rage at the ending to what was once a beloved saga.","displayName":"Kris F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1767538078/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:27:30.282Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:27:38.605Z","user":{"userId":"913488709","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kris F","accountLink":"/user/id/913488709"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Still doing the same thing as you want.

But the worst is how absolutely soulless it is. The pacing is awful, it feels like a poorly written video game fetch quest, it retcons the Last Jedi (even after the press tours saying otherwise) and delivers the worst possible ending to our heroine.","displayName":"Megan H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/790346666/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:26:08.395Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T19:53:35.582Z","user":{"userId":"871544569","realm":"RT","displayName":"Megan H","accountLink":"/user/id/871544569"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The movie isn't perfect.
