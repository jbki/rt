I’m really done with the fandom trying to tell me that I didn’t enjoy it. Of course there were complications with Carrie Fishers character causing a rewrite which I think damaged the story by not allowing the female characters to shine. The only fault was the movie catered to what the fans wanted.

It had some great sequences and effects.  Daisy is awesome!  However, it felt disjointed in some places and some movie scenes just seem to be thrown in for just to fill space.  Still better than the prequels, except for ROGUE ONE (which was awesome) and the original three episodes (Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi), plus, The Force Awakens.","displayName":"David N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T18:14:34.973Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T18:14:39.428Z","user":{"userId":"978500953","realm":"RT","displayName":"David N","accountLink":"/user/id/978500953"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"10h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome movie for avid Star Wars fans!
