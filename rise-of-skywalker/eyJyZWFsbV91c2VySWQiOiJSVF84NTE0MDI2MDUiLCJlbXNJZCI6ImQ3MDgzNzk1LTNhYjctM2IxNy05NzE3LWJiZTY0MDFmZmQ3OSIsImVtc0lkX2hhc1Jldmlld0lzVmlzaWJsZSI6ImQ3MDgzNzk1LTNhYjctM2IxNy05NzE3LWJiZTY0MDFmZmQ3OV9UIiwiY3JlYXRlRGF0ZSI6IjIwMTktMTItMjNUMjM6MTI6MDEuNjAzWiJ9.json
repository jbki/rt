A solid movie and end to the series, though it does feel a bit crammed, like some of the ideas that Abrams wanted to include in the second movie are here (Knights of Ren, etc). Overall, this trilogy feels like a back and forth between visions, with Rian Johnson throwing out a bunch of Abrams' ideas in the second film, and then Abrams doing the same in the third.","displayName":"Drew A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3611128/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T23:11:44.864Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T23:14:21.486Z","user":{"userId":"907398670","realm":"RT","displayName":"Drew A","accountLink":"/user/id/907398670"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"JJ did a good job turning it around.","displayName":"Kyle M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T23:11:43.505Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T23:11:43.505Z","user":{"userId":"9B3FF21D-9D46-4502-9B84-E148B1BDD3B7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kyle M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Awesome ending to a 40 years story amazing","displayName":"Vinnie N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2310758355709734/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T22:56:38.644Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T20:43:10.763Z","user":{"userId":"978200161","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vinnie N","accountLink":"/user/id/978200161"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"RT is so wrong...
