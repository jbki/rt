I honestly feel it would have made more sense and been more enjoyable if I had never seen a Star Wars movie before.\n\nA side effect of the hectic pacing and lack of continuity is that there wasn't nearly enough emotional build up to the big emotional scenes. I was alternately laughing or bored during major character deaths.","displayName":"Andrey T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/4003561/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T16:17:33.065Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T16:17:36.743Z","user":{"userId":"908350494","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrey T","accountLink":"/user/id/908350494"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"If you are a Star Wars movie buff you will love it.

Rise of Skywalker completely blew me away.  It was a very satisfying end to the Skywalker saga.  The inclusion of past characters was done in accordance to the lore established in the prequels and not just randomly thrown in. \n\nThere were some aspects of the movie that I could have done without though.  Mainly that there were stakes for the universe as a whole, but the plot armor was too thick for certain characters.  Losing some people in the context of this movie would have made it more impactful.  My biggest complaint though is that they fumbled some lightsaber color consistency.","displayName":"sevariun","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T16:17:09.593Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T16:17:09.593Z","user":{"userId":"9aee6216-302c-41fa-9b75-6af9a792a2a4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"sevariun","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"}]}
