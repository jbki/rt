I understand some people being disappointed with the ending to the saga but if you go in with an open mind, it's a lot of fun, nice callbacks, plenty of moments that choked me up (most involving Chewbacca), and in my opinion, a fitting end to a tremendous story spanning 5 decades.","displayName":"David E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-04T00:54:14.729Z","updateDate":"2020-01-04T00:54:14.729Z","user":{"userId":"32E95AD6-318D-4746-86E4-CD2495EEAECD","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"David E","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A must see - It was an amazing end to a 42 year saga for me!!!!!","displayName":"Mark M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-04T00:52:29.027Z","updateDate":"2020-01-04T00:52:40.820Z","user":{"userId":"978501648","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark M","accountLink":"/user/id/978501648"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Fast moving but inconsequential. Kylo was interesting, Palpatine wasted. No important questions were answered. The ellaflump in the room is how did the Emperor survive from RotJ? Usual Abrams copy and paste fare, expect no answers and a strong sense of deja vu. Now the trilogy is mercifully over we just have a totally missed opportunity. At least The Mandalorian is fairly good.","displayName":"Greg C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10156350538038352/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-04T00:51:44.373Z","updateDate":"2020-01-04T00:51:49.420Z","user":{"userId":"977264316","realm":"RT","displayName":"Greg C","accountLink":"/user/id/977264316"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"4h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Great movie but not for real fans","displayName":"Gabriel","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-04T00:50:08.438Z","updateDate":"2020-01-04T00:50:08.438Z","user":{"userId":"250047E3-8441-4031-9A03-1592DDFA6345","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Gabriel","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"4h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Star Wars movies never disappoint!
