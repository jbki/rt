After the disaster of a movie that Last Jedi was I didn't really feel like there was any need or porpoise in watching the last movie in the trilogy because I felt like the Last Jedi already ruined all plot points in the trilogy but JJ Abrhams actually succeeds in fixing most of the Last Jedi's mistakes and makes an amusing movie. That being said it felt like everything in this movie was rushed and most of the new plot should have been in The Last Jedi and that's why I believe that this trilogy would have been much better if Abraham's made all three of the movies because Rian Johnson is the worst director of this decade.","displayName":"Henk V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T22:13:36.050Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T17:46:09.284Z","user":{"userId":"977904118","realm":"RT","displayName":"Henk V","accountLink":"/user/id/977904118"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"The effects were enjoyable and they stayed true to the original movies' poorly executed and cheesy one-liners, but the entire story line (much like The Force Awakens) felt extremely recycled. Their decision to (SPOILER ALERT) resurrect Palpatine felt like a last-minute decision to tie together and frankly justify the production of these last three movies, which really didn't need to be made; I guess by saying Palpatine had been controlling the dark side this whole time made it necessary to kill him (again). Thanks, Disney, for reminding us that all you care about anymore is making as much money as possible. I can definitely say I'm relieved that I no longer have to see another Star Wars ever again (until the next three episodes come out in another ten years).","displayName":"Jamie F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T22:13:29.577Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T22:13:36.848Z","user":{"userId":"978453219","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jamie F","accountLink":"/user/id/978453219"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It was a bit of a hot mess but unlike the previous film it was actually a Star Wars film.
