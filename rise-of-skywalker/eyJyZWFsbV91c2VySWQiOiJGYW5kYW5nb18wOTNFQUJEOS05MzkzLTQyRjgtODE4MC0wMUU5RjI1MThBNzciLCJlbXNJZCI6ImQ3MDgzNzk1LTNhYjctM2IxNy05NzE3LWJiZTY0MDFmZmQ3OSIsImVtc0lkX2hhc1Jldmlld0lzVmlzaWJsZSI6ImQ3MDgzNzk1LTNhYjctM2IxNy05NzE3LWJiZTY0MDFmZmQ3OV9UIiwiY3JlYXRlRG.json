Retcons Return of the Jedi, Rey is a Mary Sue who literally gives in to the dark side yet somehow is still the good guy and the one whom the spirits of the Jedi give their power to? None of this film makes any sense whatsoever. It's a bad terrible film.","displayName":"Carey M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/591727653/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:26:45.129Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:26:45.129Z","user":{"userId":"797619149","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carey M","accountLink":"/user/id/797619149"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie to end the star wars saga.

There were some big emotional moments, some great looking action scenes, a few well executed comedy beats, all mixed in with just the right amount of fan service. This isn't high art and I don't believe it's supposed to be. It's a fun action-adventure set in space. If you're looking to get more out of that from Star Wars (or any franchise like it, for that matter) it might be time to sit back and reprioritize. I had a blast.
