His films and tv shows have always felt very safe and divested of emotion. This is a tour de force and a magnificent end to what has amounted to nearly 43 years of my life. Easily the best picture in the series since Jedi, even bettering rogue one, which I thought was a really good film. I am so happy with what JJ has done here and I will be forever grateful he embraced the world of star wars, including us super fans and gave us such a loving sendoff. especially after the spit in the face that TLJ was. Dear Rian: please watch ROS and learn what it means to be at the helm of something truly loved. There is a powerful lesson to be learned.","displayName":"steve b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:25:53.245Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:25:53.245Z","user":{"userId":"c60b864e-704a-4e0e-b561-7335a62be823","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"steve b","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Movie critics always seem to be looking for some agenda, this fixed everything Rian Johnson tried to do with the franchise.","displayName":"Joshua F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:25:47.117Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:25:47.117Z","user":{"userId":"08771309-A430-44E3-8283-9E3F1E939BE7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joshua F","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I thought this movie was one of the best of the franchise.

For all those that are giving this 5 stars... a perfect rating?!? Are you serious? You have to be paid shills or just willfully ignorant. This film is a disaster. The fact that they had to bring Palpatine back to try and salvage this was sad enough. Couple that with the cringe writing, frantic pace, and completely nonsensical plot, and you have a real mess on your hands. This was difficult to sit through and watch until the end. This film completes the dismantling of the original trilogy in such a disrespectful way. They are actually destroying source content... what a joke. None of this is canon.
