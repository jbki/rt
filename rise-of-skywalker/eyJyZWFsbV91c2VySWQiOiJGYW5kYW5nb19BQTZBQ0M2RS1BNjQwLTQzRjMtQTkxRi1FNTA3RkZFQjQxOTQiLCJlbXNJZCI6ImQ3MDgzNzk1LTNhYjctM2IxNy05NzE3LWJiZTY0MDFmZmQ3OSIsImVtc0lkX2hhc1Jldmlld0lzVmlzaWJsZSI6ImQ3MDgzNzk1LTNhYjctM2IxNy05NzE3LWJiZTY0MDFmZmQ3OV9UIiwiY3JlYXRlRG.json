If you want to see a fun space fantasy, in which a group of flawed misfits band together to oppose an evil empire against overwhelming odds...and if you don't mind a few unanswered questions or open plot lines or escapes that defy the laws of physics...then grab a bucket of popcorn and your favorite soda (or beer), sit back, and enjoy the ride.  You're in for a treat.  You'll laugh a little, cry a little, and cheer a lot.

Couldn't have asked for JJ to have done a better job completing the sequal trilogy having to pick up the pieces left in the wake of TLJ.  The only SW film that I've walked away from opening with a strong feeling of disappointment.  Please dont let the hollow reviews of some critics persuade you from seeing this film.  After all, those same critics gave high scores to the trainwreck known as The Last Jedi.","displayName":"Jason S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000536205167/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:45:50.129Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:46:36.335Z","user":{"userId":"978466738","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jason S","accountLink":"/user/id/978466738"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Need to have seen the previous movies to fully understand whatâ€™s happening","displayName":"Stephanie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T21:45:28.853Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T21:45:28.853Z","user":{"userId":"6A1BB16A-5626-46B1-BFD5-76C9971EE49F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Stephanie","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"JJ Abrams did it. I wanted to close the book on my Star Wars fandom after my viewing of TLJ. But Abrams resurrected me. . I had hoped that he might, and boy did he ever.
