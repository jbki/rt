It's insanely stupid with plot-holes the size of galaxies, it's filled with agenda even if less than Last Jedi, and it's just a lousy movie that is stupid beyond imagination. It also means the end of Star Wars caring for me - it's finally dead and dusted burned to a cinder by Disney.","displayName":"Dorian20 G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:31:32.480Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:31:42.832Z","user":{"userId":"977273192","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dorian20 G","accountLink":"/user/id/977273192"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I was born in the mid 70's and have grown up with this saga.  As a person who has been immersed in this universe almost from birth, I was very happy with this movie and how it concluded the saga.  Was it the perfect movie? No, but I don't go enjoy these films looking for perfection or my personal fan fiction to be made into reality.  I go to be told a story and I absolutely enjoyed it.   I'll definitely be going back to see it again.","displayName":"Javier A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:30:55.012Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:31:00.262Z","user":{"userId":"968808725","realm":"RT","displayName":"Javier A","accountLink":"/user/id/968808725"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it like I’ve loved all Star Wars movies.

Anakin's story is pointless now, the pacing of the movie was super fast paced. It felt like 2 movies crammed into one. The plot doesn't make any sense. If you are a casual movie goer that doesn't care about lore then this is a decent movie. But if you LOVE Star Wars lore then you'll probably hate this as much as I do.","displayName":"Swany P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T21:29:38.179Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T21:29:38.179Z","user":{"userId":"976981476","realm":"RT","displayName":"Swany P","accountLink":"/user/id/976981476"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"}]}
