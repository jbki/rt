Absolutely some holes in the longstanding story but draws to a close the saga in a way the closes a lot of storylines. Abrams does a decent job of telling the story but had to overcome some issues in the previous installment. The musical score is one of John Williams' best and his cameo is awesome. The acting is among the best in the entire saga and the camaraderie of the new trio is strong in this movie.","displayName":"Jeffrey T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/570970175/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T02:28:57.071Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T01:01:28.549Z","user":{"userId":"795605585","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeffrey T","accountLink":"/user/id/795605585"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It paid respect to fans, it made it fun to watch, it made me feel like I might tear up at least 5 times. NO ITS NOT PERFECT. Blame Kennedy and Johnson for this mess, but this final movie tried to fix the past. I left feeling like I will be back to see it again and that is not how I felt after watching the last jedi. Not even my kids liked the Last jedi. They did like The Rise of Skywalker and thats all I need.","displayName":"TJ W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T02:22:28.766Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T16:29:20.061Z","user":{"userId":"978462621","realm":"RT","displayName":"TJ W","accountLink":"/user/id/978462621"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Love everything about this movie.
