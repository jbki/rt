It was exciting and there were a lot of really awesome scenes. I am a fan of Kylo Ren as a character and I particularly enjoyed his story in this movie. It's not a perfect movie but it is really getting a lot of criticism that is way too harsh.

This movie was good. Very entertaining and felt like a star wars movie, unlike number 8 which was an utter disappointment. I definitely felt like the movie was skipping around a lot and it was hard to follow. I wish that they had expanded on parts that they did not. Overall, I would see the movie again and again. It was honestly so fun to watch and it kept me on my toes. Its exactly what you can expect from a star wars movie","displayName":"Eric E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T20:43:31.229Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T20:43:31.229Z","user":{"userId":"978453039","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eric E","accountLink":"/user/id/978453039"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I truly think this film was the best of the franchise.
