Kathleen Kennedy and the writers of this film have drastically lowered the bar for star wars films. They some how found a way to make the prequels look like masterpieces, and don't forget that those movies had Jar Jar in them. Too many plot holes, and too much retconning. Next time plan out an entire trilogy instead of writing it a movie at a time.","displayName":"Gabe C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100003726375007/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:17:35.028Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:17:39.634Z","user":{"userId":"932888260","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gabe C","accountLink":"/user/id/932888260"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The whole movie was awesome they ended the Skywalker saga the way I hoped it would end!","displayName":"Kimberly","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T18:17:07.896Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T18:17:07.896Z","user":{"userId":"5e8aee96-e279-4fbf-88f5-5d473d204371","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kimberly","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"\"It's the best Star Wars movie ever!\" Said by my 10yo son as soon as credits rolled.
