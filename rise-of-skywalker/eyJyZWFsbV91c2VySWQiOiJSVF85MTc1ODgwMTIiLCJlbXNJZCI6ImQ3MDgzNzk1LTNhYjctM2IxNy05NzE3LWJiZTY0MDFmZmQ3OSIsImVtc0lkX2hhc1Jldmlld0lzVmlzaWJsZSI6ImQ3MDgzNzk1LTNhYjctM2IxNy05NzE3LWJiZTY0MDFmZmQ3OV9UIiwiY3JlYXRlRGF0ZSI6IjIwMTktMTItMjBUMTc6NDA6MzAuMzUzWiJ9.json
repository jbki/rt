I found myself frequently smiling, laughing, and on a deeper level, connecting with the force. It was honestly a fun movie. But where the light side abounded, the dark abounded more.\n\nThere was simply too much ground to cover here, too many questions forcing this film into half-hearted explanations and glaring plot holes. Since the first of the Disney era, I was nervous about the finale's ability to cap off the saga cleanly. Those fears persisted and persisted throughout the film until the credits finally rolled and I realized it was over. While I hoped against hope that the new trilogy wouldn't end up being a money grab in its purest sense, I can't see any other reason for its existence. I had a good time along this ride, but the negatives far outweighs the positives, and I fear the dark side of Disney's Empire won out in the end.","displayName":"Ben P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1679666858/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:40:08.721Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:40:33.791Z","user":{"userId":"884284179","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ben P","accountLink":"/user/id/884284179"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I love SW. Love it so much! And SW9 killed this love. It was boring from the 1/3 of the movie. It wasn't fun at all.  I hope I won't be forced to rewatch it for the second time. I beg my mind to vanish my memory about SW9... Baby \"yoda\" from The Mandalorian worth much more, then whole New Awful Trilogy... Shame you, Disney. Shame you, Abrams. Rian Johnson, forgive us, because your controversial SW8 wasn't even close to that boring trash without essence, that was named as \"The Rise of Skywalker\"...","displayName":"Viktor N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:40:00.134Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:40:00.632Z","user":{"userId":"978451384","realm":"RT","displayName":"Viktor N","accountLink":"/user/id/978451384"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I had a blast with all my old friends.

Everyone loves chocolate ice cream, it's sweet and fun and nostalgic. It's more interesting than Vanilla, though there are some people who would prefer something more complex, like a rocky road or a mint chip, but most people are going to enjoy the chocolate. Do I think it would be better if there were some sprinkles or chopped nuts on top, yeah, but I still like chocolate ice cream.","displayName":"Austin W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:39:49.309Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:40:02.625Z","user":{"userId":"976929489","realm":"RT","displayName":"Austin W","accountLink":"/user/id/976929489"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It's an entertaining movie, nothing more nothing less.
