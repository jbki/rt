Some brilliant scenes were neutered by moments of overly convenient plot developments for the protagonists. I felt this movie isn't awful if JJ Abrams had taken more time with this film.

The jaw dropping effects and the relatively mediocre storyline (a much improvement over the last jedi) had me and my mates enjoy an evening out. The movie did drag along a bit much though, making the big climax at the end seem quite underwhelming. Nevertheless, the movie has a pretty decent ending and is good enough for an ending to a long lasting saga we've been waiting for for so many years.","displayName":"Reece F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T17:08:13.749Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T17:08:17.306Z","user":{"userId":"978446206","realm":"RT","displayName":"Reece F","accountLink":"/user/id/978446206"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Fast paced, and a complete joy ride. Severe plot holes and felt like this was band aid to appease fans instead of being genuine. Biggest mistake was redeeming Ben and them killing  him.
