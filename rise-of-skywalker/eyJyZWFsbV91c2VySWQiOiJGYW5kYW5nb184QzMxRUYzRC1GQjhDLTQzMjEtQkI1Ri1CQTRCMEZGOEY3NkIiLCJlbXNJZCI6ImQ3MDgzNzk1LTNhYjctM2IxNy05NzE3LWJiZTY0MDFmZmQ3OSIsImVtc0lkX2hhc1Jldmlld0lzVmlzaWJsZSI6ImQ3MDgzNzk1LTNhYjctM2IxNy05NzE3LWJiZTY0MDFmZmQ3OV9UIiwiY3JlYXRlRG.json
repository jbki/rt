GREAT TRANSITION from the very first episodes tying in to the FINAL SAGA. YOU WILL LOVE this final movie IF YOU ARE A TRUE STAR WARS FAN!!!

Where The Last Jedi really lacked in story I personally believe this movie really connected ALL 9 movies together with a satisfying and emotionally stimulating ending. No one can argue that visually, the movie is outstanding. The story is undeniably, quite complex. It could well have been split into two but due to the awkward situation of the last movie not going down well with most fans, JJ had to really make this a capturing story whilst cramming a crap ton of plot into it. For anyone who is a big fan of the franchise this should be a very satisfying end to the saga plus for those, like me, who felt the sequels lacked character depth - this movie does help you enjoy TFA & TLJ more knowing what we do about the characters and their background at the end of ROTS. Just keep in mind, it'll never really \"feel like a Star Wars movie\" the way the originals did. Instead its a refreshing, new take on the movie whilst still sticking to the fundamentals of the franchise the fans love (John Williams proves himself as an incredible composer once again for example!)","displayName":"Louie T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2647560435365467/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-22T20:54:21.448Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T20:54:29.723Z","user":{"userId":"978465982","realm":"RT","displayName":"Louie T","accountLink":"/user/id/978465982"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Between the agenda(identity politics) they just couldn't leave out of this movie to the fast paced, awful acting, this movie is a dumpster fire.
