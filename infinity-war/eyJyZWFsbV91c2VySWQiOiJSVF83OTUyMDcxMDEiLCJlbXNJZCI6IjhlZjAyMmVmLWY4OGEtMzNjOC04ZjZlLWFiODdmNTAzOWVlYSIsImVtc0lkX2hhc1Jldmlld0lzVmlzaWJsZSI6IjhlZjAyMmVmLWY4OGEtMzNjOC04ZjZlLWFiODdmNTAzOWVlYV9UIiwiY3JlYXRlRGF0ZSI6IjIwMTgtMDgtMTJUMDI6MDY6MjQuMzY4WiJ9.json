You can think it was a worth while movie. But this movie makes me feel like dairy cow being completely sucked dry. I was prepared for this movie to be one big show stopping hit. A big amazing movie for the summer. For the century. But no. It was an alright movie that was a prequel for a hundred more $15 a pop movies. It is complete bait. Watch it so you will end up paying more and more and more until you finally reach a conclusion. Let's tell everyone this is a big ball busting movie with all their favorite characters! Then, kill them all off until they pay more money to see the sequel. I give it 1 star not because it was a terrible movie but because Hollywood gets away with this crap too much. Ticket prices need to come down or movies need to finish a $15 dollar worthy two hour story in two hours.","displayName":"Jason P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-11T22:00:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-11T22:06:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"974662324","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jason P","accountLink":"/user/id/974662324"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Good movie very disappointing ending that let’s you down after your excited with the movie","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-11T19:21:48.259Z","updateDate":"2018-08-11T19:21:48.259Z","user":{"userId":"260158443","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260158443"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Too much buzz.

I'm very happy to say that my fears were put to rest as I sat through this near masterpiece of a superhero film. Holy hell, did they truly deliver. Ten years in the making and the patience of both sides paid off. Never have I walked out of a comic book feeling so relieved and excited for the sequel. People might laugh at this, but I felt like I walked out of The Empire Strikes Back of this generation. I witnessed movie history. I will be counting down the days until I get to see how the Avengers go up against Marvel's truly biggest bad.","displayName":"David M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-10T21:21:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-10T21:26:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"937110996","realm":"RT","displayName":"David M","accountLink":"/user/id/937110996"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 10, 2018"}]}
