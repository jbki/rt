Infinity War definitely took care of my concerns and felt like the shortest 2.5 hour movie as I wanted to see more! Having not read any of the comics to know the story line, I avoided every article/interview prior to watching as I wanted to have this package unwrapped in a surprising way. Boy did it deliver! As soon as my wife and I left the theater, we wanted to watch again. Needless to say I have already pre-ordered the 4k version :)","displayName":"Patrick W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T19:58:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T20:02:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"937190991","realm":"RT","displayName":"Patrick W","accountLink":"/user/id/937190991"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Funny to sad!
