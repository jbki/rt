This film can only be described as a roller coaster. It has very high highs, low lows, and the destination doesn't matter because it's all about the ride, and quite a ride it is. It's as funny and action-packed as expected, and more emotional than expected. The cross-film interactions are always fun, and this film leans into that, while Brolin puts on the best performance in a Super Hero film in recent memory. The issue comes with the fact that due to story holes and depth constraints, there's really a ceiling on how great a Marvel movie can be. Thankfully, they seem to be hitting their head on this ceiling a lot, and maybe cracked it a little with this film.","displayName":"Sanjay R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T08:27:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T10:10:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"905108980","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sanjay R","accountLink":"/user/id/905108980"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"An ending most people will not appreciate but i believe it was bold and different from the norm.

First off this is the first of two parts, you will leave asking questions, you will leave asking WTF just happened and you will definitely be confused. But this isn't because of plotholes and unanswered questions this is because this isn't the end of this film. There is more to come the questions will be answered. Second, this is a film about Thanos not the heros, this is about him completing his quest, with real motives and genuine beliefs, his ideas are that of a bad guy but he believes that he is on the side of good. He is acting on behalf of the universe, because no-one else has the will to act. So when you go in looking for you favourite hero, don't expect to pleased by the result.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/814537515409768/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T08:17:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T08:28:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248313","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977248313"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"An exciting, intense adventure from start to finish.

Each character is large in their own right & have movies of their very own to shine in, but to bring them all together for one purpose is valiant in its ambition. In today's political climate where everyone is partisan,  Avenger's Infinity War appears as a model for how we as nation's & individual's should unite.\nThanos, the ULTIMATE megalomaniacal villain, is uncanny in his likeness to the various political villain's that inhabit our White House today! I only hope that the fate of our current universe will not meet the same fate as does the universe in Avengers Infinity War as it is cataclysmically devastating, with absolutely no happy ending and only a glimmer of hope.","displayName":"Nicole W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/629552660/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T08:13:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T08:24:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"807274052","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nicole W","accountLink":"/user/id/807274052"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Infinity war left everyone in the room speechless... the room was quiet, so quiet.
