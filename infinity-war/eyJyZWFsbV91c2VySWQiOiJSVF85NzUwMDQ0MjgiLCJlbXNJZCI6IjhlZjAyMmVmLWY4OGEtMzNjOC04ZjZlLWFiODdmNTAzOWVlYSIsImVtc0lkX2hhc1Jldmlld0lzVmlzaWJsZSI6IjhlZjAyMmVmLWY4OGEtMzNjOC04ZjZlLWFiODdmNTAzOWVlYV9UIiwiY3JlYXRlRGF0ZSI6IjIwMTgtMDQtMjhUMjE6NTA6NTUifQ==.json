Does that mean this film is perfect.... I think so. Benecio Del Toro was a tad bit annoying, for literally 10 seconds, but I cannot think of much else. There is so much this film does right and it is one hell of an achievement. I went to see it again just to make sure that this film truly did exist. An event such as this has never happened in the history of filmaking (a culmination of a non stop 10 years in plot converging into one massive movie) and the fact that it actually works is amazing. And beyond that, the fact that it achieves all the wonder by having the villain be the actual main character brings the film to a level I did not think was attainable. It is perfect. \nAnd as a long time DC fan, this makes me weep because I practically saw everything I would ever hope to see from a film starring Darkseid and the glorious excess of his army but I see it in a Marvel film. This review is getting way too nerdy so I will just end it by saying that this film is truly perfect and one for the ages. The best superhero movie of all time, bar none.","displayName":"William M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/515617106/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T21:50:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T22:02:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"789892006","realm":"RT","displayName":"William M","accountLink":"/user/id/789892006"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fun and exciting.

I have hated what Disney has done with Star Wars but they made a masterpiece with Infinity War. From beginning to end the film has laugh and action. Movie does a great job switching between scenes and characters and the ending is amazing. Truly love this movie. Thank you Disney for such a great film. F you on what you have done to Star Wars except Rogue one (great movie as well) Infinity war does a great job also paying honor to what was on the original comic. Having bought all issues including the crossovers of the comic when I was a kid I can through say this might be better than the book except for the missing characters due to movie rights and such. But giving Thanos an alternative reason for his quest for the gems was brilliant. End game is the same but reason for and ending is different. Wonâ€™t go on. Donâ€™t want to ruin the films for others. Just watch and have a good time.
