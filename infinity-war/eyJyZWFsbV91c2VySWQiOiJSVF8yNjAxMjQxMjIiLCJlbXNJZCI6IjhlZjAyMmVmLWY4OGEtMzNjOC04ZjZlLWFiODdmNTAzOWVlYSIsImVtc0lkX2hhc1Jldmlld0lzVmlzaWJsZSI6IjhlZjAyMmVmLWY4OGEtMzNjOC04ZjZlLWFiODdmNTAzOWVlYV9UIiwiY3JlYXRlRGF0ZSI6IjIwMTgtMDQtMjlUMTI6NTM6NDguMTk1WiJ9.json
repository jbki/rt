The movie sets off where the Thor Ragnarok dropped us on. Out of all the disposable villains in the MCU, now thanos holds the throne next to Logi and Kill Monger.

The film's humor, special effects, performances and soundtrack all make for decent mindless entertainment, but, as a film that seems to aspire to be more than that, it falls flat, largely due to some seriously glaring flaws that undermine the basic logic driving its narrative. That fundamental shortcoming, combined with an inadequate back story (essential for a complex, multifaceted story such as this) and a conclusion that assures a sequel to resolve what was left undone here (keeping the film from standing alone), undercuts this offering's other strengths. Have fun watching this one, but don't expect the kind of groundbreaking cinema that many claim it to be.","displayName":"Facebook U","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T12:43:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-04T03:56:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"935590807","realm":"RT","displayName":"Facebook U","accountLink":"/user/id/935590807"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"just a masterpiece..","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1460320210742484/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T12:43:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T12:44:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"976880869","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976880869"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"}]}
