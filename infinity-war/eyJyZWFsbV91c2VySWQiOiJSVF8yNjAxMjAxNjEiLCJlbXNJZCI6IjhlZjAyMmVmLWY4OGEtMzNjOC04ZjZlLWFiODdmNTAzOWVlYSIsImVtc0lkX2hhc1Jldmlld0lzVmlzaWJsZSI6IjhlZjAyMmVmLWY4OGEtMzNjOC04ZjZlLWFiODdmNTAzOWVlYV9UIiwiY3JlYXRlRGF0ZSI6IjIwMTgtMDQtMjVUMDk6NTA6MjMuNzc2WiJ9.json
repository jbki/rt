With the highest ambition, the Russo Brothers created a spectacle that any moviegoer should see. It is one of the most exhilarating, emotional, devastating, action-packed, exciting, and comical movie that I have ever seen. Despite a main cast of 23 characters, the Russo brothers were able to pull off a deep story line, and coupled with phenomenal acting by the likes of Robert Downey Jr., Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Chirs Hemsworth, and many more, the movie shines greatly. The heart truly races with this movie, and any person or critic who claims that this movie is bad, should greatly reconsider the direction of America cinematography because Avengers Infinity War has shown that a spectacular movie can be made on such a large scale.","displayName":"Sami F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T08:55:42.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-24T17:58:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"948797046","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sami F","accountLink":"/user/id/948797046"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Just watched Avengers Infinity War today and as a huge Marvel fan, I have to pitch in. I won't be revealing any spoilers out of respect to those that haven't caught it. But all I can say is this movie is filled with amazing action, fight scenes, funny moments and also SHELL SHOCKING revelations and moments. The portrayal of Thanos by Josh Brolin really deserves an Oscar for it. The Russo Brothers have certainly outdone any other superhero movies ever made. Make sure you stay till the end. Frankly, once you have watched the movie, you will be rooted to your seat for a long while because your mind won't be able to process all that has happened. But enjoy the movie nonetheless. Box office numbers, this is definitely deserving a spot at the top.","displayName":"Sherman C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100005615831400/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T08:51:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-25T08:56:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"955872474","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sherman C","accountLink":"/user/id/955872474"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"}]}
