But this film, culminating ten years of Marvel Excellence, stands up to the test. We all knew it was going to be a thrill ride, but the amount of intensity you feel through the many emotions the film pulls out of the audience. We know the mission. We know the villain. What we didn’t know was the cost it would take and how it would all add up. The Russo brothers along with Mcfeely and Markus, did an amazing job, and sure there are parts where the acting of some characters lacks, but the action, excitement and comedy makes up for it and then some. Anticipate the adventure, prepare for the cliffhanger, but be ready to be very enthused and entertained!
