While I absolutely do love it I had some things that I felt were maybe imperfect about Infinity War, but my biggest concern was that it seemed like it would be absolutely meaningless to somebody who didn't put in the effort of watching the 18 movies leading up to it. You can probably assuage that fear though, because I went to see it with two people who had only seen Black Panther at this point, and they both loved it, with minimal confusion.\n\nPersonally? I can't wait to see it again. This is probably the most excited I've been about the second watch of an MCU film since the first Avengers.","displayName":"Gimly M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/584658586/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-05T05:06:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-05T05:06:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"861960467","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gimly M","accountLink":"/user/id/861960467"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":" Action packed marvel movie, seemed like there was to many stars.

It’s far from ever being considered a classic. Really, I think in 20 years we’ll look back and shake our heads at how the comic book genre got out of hand. The Avengers, X-Men, and DC films need to die off. “Dark Knight” was the apex of the genre and should have spelled the beginning of the end. It’s laziness on behalf of the studios and the public to accept this as top notch entertainment. Welcome to America circa 2018.

Most movies (including most of Marvel's) water down the weight of the story to give it a more light hearted vibe so it can be fun for the family... This movie, as it definitely should, is not afraid to give the audience two and a half hours of action and emotion that drills down to the bone of the characters and the audience. This is not a family movie, but it has some family friendly aspect to it, which is good. This movie took all of the things we have come to know and love over the past ten years and tore it apart in the greatest way imaginable. Never would I ever have thought that my favorite movie would be, of all things, all of the heroes I love coming together not to win, but to fail so spectacularly. There's victory, there's defeat, but in the end all that is left is suffering, death, and utter failure. I also never thought that I could love any other villain as much or have one be the spotlight of the movie for me as the Joker in The Dark Knight, but Thanos takes the place of the greatest villain of all time in my eyes. He is incredibly powerful, relatable, scary, and best of all, he is both humane and inhumane in all of the best ways. He's everything all of the greatest villains are and more. Probably the most emotional moment I have ever had with a movie was that very last scene of the movie just before the credits. Watching the movie end was bone chilling, gratifying, and the best feeling I have ever had with any movie. If there is any movie that will go down in history as my favorite movie of all time, it is this one.","displayName":"Good S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-05T00:12:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-05T00:26:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"977306598","realm":"RT","displayName":"Good S","accountLink":"/user/id/977306598"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 05, 2018"}]}
