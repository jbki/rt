I wished that Thanos would kill me but he chose to literally kill the rest of the entire cast instead. I'd rather watch the entire Twilight series twice while sleep deprived and only offered rotten tripe from a trash can to eat instead of watching this movie once. I'm quite sure I just lost a decade from my overall lifespan and I wish I lost more because I've become clinically depressed over this and I don't think I have any reason to live anymore.

Nothing before has ever juggled so many characters and  story elements let alone done so with such incredible success. \n\nNo one should watch this if they aren't familiar with the main outline of the MCU up to this point. You'll only appreciate just how amazing this is if you've seen just about all of them. Almost every film contributes to the drama that pays off here in some way.\n\nUnlike many I've never been sold on Thanos's malthusian motivation but he's still a fantastic and truly imposing antagonist.\n\nPretty much everything else in this film is a triumph. Extraordinary. Must see.","displayName":"Dan W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/432197670910971/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-06-02T09:23:49.218Z","updateDate":"2019-06-02T09:23:49.218Z","user":{"userId":"978089859","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dan W","accountLink":"/user/id/978089859"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wow. What can I say about this movie to be able to fit it in a paragraph. This movie was extremely exciting and extremely awesome. The action is top notch for the MCU and some of the best ever. Thanos is the villain we have all been waiting for and just what we need. This movie's cast all perform excellently. The comedy is good. The third act is far and away the best in the MCU. The ending is shocking and still gives me many goosebumps to this day. This movie is extremely great. I cannot stress that enough. The cast, the score, the CGI, the mocap, Thanos, the action, the plot, and the cliffhanger. I'm not going to delve too far into this movie, but there is so much I can say. The only downside is that there are quite a few points in the movie that happen and don't make sense, and quite a few that are an extreme coincidence. The ending was the best thing I have seen to date. So much good about this movie, and easily one of the best movies I have ever seen. \n9.8/10","displayName":"Bill V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/834856386867255/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-06-02T03:24:00.328Z","updateDate":"2019-06-02T03:24:00.328Z","user":{"userId":"978017135","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bill V","accountLink":"/user/id/978017135"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 02, 2019"}]}
