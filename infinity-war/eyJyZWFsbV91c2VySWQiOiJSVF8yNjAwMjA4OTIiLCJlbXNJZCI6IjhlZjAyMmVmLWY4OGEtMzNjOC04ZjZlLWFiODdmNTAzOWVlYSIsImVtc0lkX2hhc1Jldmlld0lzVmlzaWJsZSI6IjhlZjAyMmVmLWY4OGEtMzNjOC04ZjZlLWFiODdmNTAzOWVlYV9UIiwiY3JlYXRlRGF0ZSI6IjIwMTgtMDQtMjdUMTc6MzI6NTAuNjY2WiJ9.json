Definitely a movie that is much better seen if you know your way around the MCU a bit. If you haven't paid much attention to the MCU, you might do well to brush up first; Avengers 1, Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America: Civil War, Thor Ragnarok and Black Panther are probably the most important to see in preparation, but any movie you haven't seen yet you'd be better off watching first. There are some decent 15-20 minute long Infinity War prep videos that attempt to summarize the chronology of all 18 previous MCU films, too. I suggest this because one of the big criticisms I see is that the movie is too stuffed, not enough character development, too much to follow, etc. And there's good reason for that -- this movie presumes a lot of MCU knowledge and investment.","displayName":"Dodge C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T17:32:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T17:39:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243955","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dodge C","accountLink":"/user/id/977243955"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I've never been as anxious in my life than I was through this film then I left the cinema in a state of shock it has the right amount of everything funny, thrilling, nail biting and shocking for me the film is perfect!","displayName":"Danny M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/590411092/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T17:31:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T17:36:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"967742202","realm":"RT","displayName":"Danny M","accountLink":"/user/id/967742202"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Nope, nope and nope.","displayName":"Dan B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T17:31:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T17:31:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"976863252","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dan B","accountLink":"/user/id/976863252"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I really liked the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, the rest was just average.","displayName":"anthony m","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T17:29:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T09:18:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"883287114","realm":"RT","displayName":"anthony m","accountLink":"/user/id/883287114"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Exceptional.

What really holds this movie is not the action or the effects, it’s the acting. The actors have grown into their roles and this is truly a great ensemble.
