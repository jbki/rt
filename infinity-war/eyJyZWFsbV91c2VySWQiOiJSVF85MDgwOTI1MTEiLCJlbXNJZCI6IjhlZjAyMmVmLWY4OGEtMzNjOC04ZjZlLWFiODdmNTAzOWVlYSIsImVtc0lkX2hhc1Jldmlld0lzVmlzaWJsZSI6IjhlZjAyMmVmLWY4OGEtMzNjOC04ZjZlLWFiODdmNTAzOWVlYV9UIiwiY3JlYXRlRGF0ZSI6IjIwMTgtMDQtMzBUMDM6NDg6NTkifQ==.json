I found it interesting that Thanos was basically a crazy environmental wack job fascist. The movie did an amazing job of bringing together characters that had never been together and placing them all in different environments. And when Captain America shows up the audience cheered. There was also some cool surprises of past characters. And it all worked. There were three stories and by the end two had come together. It left you wanting more and asking what is next. I had an idea of what would happen, but didn't think they would do it. But they went for it and it worked. And while there is some humor they didn't place humor in places that are to be serious. I didn't like what happened with Hulk, but I hope that will change in the next movie. Overall a great MCU movie.

The movie, like its protagonists’ shortcomings, and it’s central villain’s ironic tenderness, was not perfect, but flawed perfectly. To wrap a bow on the entangled mess that is the marvel universe, and deliver a movie that effectively covers over 200 years of collective comic book schizophrenia is a monumental feat. Those who know enough about the players and their stories, know putting this many Marvel characters that collide with Thanos together into one movie that makes sense is amazing by itself. Those who criticize the film for its jumbled content do not have a true sense of how difficult that endeavor really was. The comic one-liners were there to balance the darkness and intensity of Thanos and where the movie was headed. Additionally, they breathed life into the characters that truly have these personalities. Strange and Stark engaging in their own egotistical ping pong, Thor and Quinn’s emasculating masculinity sidebars, even Banner and the Hulk’s (not so inner tug-o-war performance anxiety) dialogue were welcomed relief at strategic points throughout the film. If you were too busy taking the film too serious at those times, then you missed several key foreshadows for the film to come. Much of what I see complained of, had nothing to do with the craftsmanship of the storyline, the acting, or the presentation, but merely viewer preferences regarding airtime for certain favorites, etc. You can’t please everyone all of the time, and this film, though adapted to please the masses (clearly, see $250M opening weekend), was really aimed at pleasing those that have been keeping a close watch over the universal storyline and the evolution of the characters to this pivotal crossroad battle and beyond. The cliffhanger ending was not so cliffhanger-ish at all if you know the story well enough. In fact, even if you just followed the dialogue of this movie alone, instead of looking for ways to poke holes in the movie, then it did not come as a shock to you at all. Neither will what is coming next. Great film. Go see it once for the story, and again to appreciate all of the artistry you missed the first time around while you were trying to keep up with all the action.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T03:27:47.179Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T03:27:47.179Z","user":{"userId":"974944245","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/974944245"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Marvel movie yet.
