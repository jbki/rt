Many critics demonstrate a lack of comprehension for what it was they were reviewing.  It amazes me anyone can hold a job in press while shamelessly throwing their reputation behind complaints that (among others) one would have to have seen a variety of previous MCU films to appreciate or understand this one.  Apparently, anything more complex than a trilogy is just too much fuss?  What, are we 5 years old?  \n     Similarly, I've read complaints about Infinity War filming on too many sets, or that there are just so many superheroes, or that this is an epic about the fate of the universe instead of Captain America's pet cat--all as part of the vapid yet superfluous collection of The New Yorker critics' ontological whining.  For a public movie goer, there might be an excusable ignorance for such criticism; but for a supposed professional, these attempts are more an opining spectacle than a serious analysis.  They scream, \"Look at me!\", when they should convey at least a reasonably articulate interpretation of the thing, in and of itself.  Yeah, I'm including you, Anthony Lane.  Wit and substance are more helpful when they are equivalent.\n     Any sincere consideration of the monumental task of assembling this epic, from the frame of production, but also the juggling of intellectual character rights, respective to the written adaptation from the comic saga, would, at minimum, demand sober credit given to the delicate and extensive weave presented in Infinity War.  The film exhibits a hallmark, like hand quilted fabric-syncopated by imperfections here and there, sure, but made with undeniable heart, dedication, and creativity.  It emerges, as have all previous films, as a part of an ecology of storytelling.  This movie is no less than part of an unfolding redefinition of the genre.  For the most part, the MCU has done well to try to respect their fans, whether naïve newcomers to the Marvel Universe, or canonical in their history.  We don't expect poor quality with each iteration, and that speaks volumes. \n     I do understand some criticism, that Thanos has a flimsy ideological excuse for killing off half the universe; but I prefer it to his motivation in the source material, in which there wasn't an ideology at all.  His MCU intention to find a solution to the problem of \"life vs. limited resources\" is a bit obtuse, I agree.  It still makes for better cinema however, than the embarrassing drama of the Mad Titan threatening all of existence just to try to impress a girl, as per the original story.  They took a space opera and turned it into cinema.\n     It is respectable that they chose to leave the viewer with the utter apparent defeat of the heroes-there was no feel-good dopamine addled reward in the haunting genocide.  This was a mature choice; even in the dedication to the viewer-to not cave to the impulse desire to see some victory.  Instead only the possibility of victory is suggested.  Withholding the reward in this ending offers the audience a much sweeter, though uncertain potential later.  Even knowing there will most likely be resurrections, we launch into unknown territory.  We, who have come to know these heroes over the course of years, are left with no control and a naked set of hopes.","displayName":"Cody S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-30T11:46:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-16T03:55:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"907682161","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cody S","accountLink":"/user/id/907682161"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie!
