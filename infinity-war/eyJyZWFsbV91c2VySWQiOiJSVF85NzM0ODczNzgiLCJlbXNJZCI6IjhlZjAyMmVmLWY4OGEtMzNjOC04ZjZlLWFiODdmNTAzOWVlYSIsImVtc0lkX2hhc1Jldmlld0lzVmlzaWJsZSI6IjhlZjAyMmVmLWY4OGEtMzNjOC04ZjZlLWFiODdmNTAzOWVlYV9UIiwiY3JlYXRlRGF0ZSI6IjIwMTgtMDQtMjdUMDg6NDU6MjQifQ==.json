There will be those who complain because of the way the movie ends, but when you're dealing with a 5 hour magnum opus, you have to break a movie at some point in time to divide it into parts.  Much like LOTR 15 years ago, movies might stop abruptly on the initial viewing, but fit seamlessly when you look at the whole.  \n\nThe movie has all the action, humor, and drama that you could possibly ever want out of a superhero film (MCU or otherwise).  It demands your attention from the opening sequence and never stops for 2 hours and 40 minutes until it hits a brick wall when the credits roll.\n\nTHANOS is a masterpiece of comic book villainy.  Any great movie needs a great villain and Thanos certainly fits the bill.  The absolute best thing about a villain is one with great motives (and doubly so if you can relate to why they are doing what they are doing).  From that standpoint, Thanos is fully fleshed out this time and you can understand the why for what he is wanting to do.  \n\nFantastic writing.  A definite must see.  But remember, this is only 1/2 of the movie.  We have to wait for 2019 for the final act.","displayName":"Robert M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1262921068/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T08:45:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T08:49:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"862943460","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert M","accountLink":"/user/id/862943460"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"best marvel movie ever ☠☠☠","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T08:43:07.893Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T08:43:07.893Z","user":{"userId":"821206969","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/821206969"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Non-spoiler review: \n\nWhoa. This is probably the most serious/heavy MCU movie, even with all the humor throughout (there were some great lines for sure). It definitely is intended to be a two-part experience and May 2019 can't come fast enough in my opinion. I don't think I've ever been in an MCU movie where it was so quiet during the end credits, and actually in the intro as well.\n\nIf you haven't seen all of the previous MCU movies you might want to at least watch some recaps. This is my recommended minimum viewing:\n1. Captain America (recap might be fine)\n2. The Avengers\n3. Thor The Dark World (a recap would probably work fine)\n4. Captain America: Winter Soldier\n5. Guardians of the Galaxy\n6. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2\n7. Avengers: Age of Ultron\n8. Captain America: Civil War\n9. Doctor Strange\n10. Thor: Ragnarok\n11. Black Panther (a recap might work but highly recommend watching the full thing)\n\nThere is a post-credit scene (nothing mid-credits) that is worth staying for and actually has a purpose but you can probably look it up online if you don't want to stick around. \n\nI watched it in IMAX 3D. I recommend IMAX if you can since it was filmed with IMAX cameras and it is really cool to see that large, but the 3D didn't feel like it added much to the experience. As far as length goes, the 2hr40min runtime didn't seem that long. A lot happens, and a few of the characters have decent arcs, and there is decent character development for many. For how many big characters are in the movie I thought it was very well written and directed to include most of them pretty well. Black Widow seemed to have the least out of all the original Avengers, which I'm hoping they'll make up for in the next one.\n\nAll in all I liked it a lot but have a hard time ranking it as far as favorites go at this point in time (too soon). I recommend it but it's probably worth viewing before taking younger kids (pretty heavy, lots of fighting and death).","displayName":"Jessica O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T08:42:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T09:08:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"959961566","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jessica O","accountLink":"/user/id/959961566"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is a great movie even with a twisted ending and great characters especially Thanos and I hope Avengers 4 will be a lot better","displayName":"Kyle W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1714709155479195/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T08:41:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T08:42:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"974523051","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kyle W","accountLink":"/user/id/974523051"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was great!
