By:Clem The Movie Guy. Avengers: Infinity War is the highly-anticipated19th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) & one of the most massively epic superhero films ever. For the past six years, The Avengers team, consisting of Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) & Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) has been protecting the universe from destruction by evil forces. Now the team, who have gone their separate ways, are compelled to come together & join forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy team of Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) & Mantis (Pom Klementieff) to battle Thanos (Josh Brolin), the most dangerous villain that any of them have ever faced. The Avengers & the Guardians along with Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland), T’Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Wanda Maximoff/Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Bucky Barnes/Winter Solder (Sebastian Stan), Vision (Paul Bettany), & James “Rhodey” Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle) must find a way to prevent Thanos, who has already has possession of three of the Infinity Stones, from finding the other three stones & decimating the universe to fulfill his heinous promise. Directed by Anthony & Joe Russo from a screenplay written by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, Avengers: Infinity War was an exhilarating, intensely exciting & wildly funny powerhouse of a summer film. The performances from this massive cast were excellent. Avengers: Infinity War is the first of two films with the second film coming out on May 3, 2019. Infinity War has one post-credit scene that sets up the next Marvel superhero character. SEE THIS FILM in 2D, 3D or IMAX 3D, if you haven’t seen it yet!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T21:55:31.196Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T21:55:31.196Z","user":{"userId":"260011684","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260011684"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Marvel film up to date!!!
