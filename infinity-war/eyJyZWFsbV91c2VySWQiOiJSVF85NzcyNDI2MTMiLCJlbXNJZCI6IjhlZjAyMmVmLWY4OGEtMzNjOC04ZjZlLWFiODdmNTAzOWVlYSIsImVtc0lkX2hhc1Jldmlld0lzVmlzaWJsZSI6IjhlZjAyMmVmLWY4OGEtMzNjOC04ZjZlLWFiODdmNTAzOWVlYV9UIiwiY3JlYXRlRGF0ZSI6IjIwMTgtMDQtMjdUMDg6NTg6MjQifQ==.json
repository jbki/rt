It was emotional, yet gritty. Everything about it worked. The comedic relief wasn’t over the top, and neither was the action. It’s a story about a “man” in pain that has a twisted sense of moral obligation. The combination of the two is utterly and eagerly catastrophic, something that transpires by the end of the film.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T08:50:04.124Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T08:50:04.124Z","user":{"userId":"970372665","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/970372665"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
