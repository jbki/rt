There rinse and repeat formulaic approach can be critiqued (by people like me) but in reality, it just works. Infinity War is the culmination of all that. And boy does it deliver... Hurtling along at break neck speed over 149 minutes I never once felt it dragging. How the Russo brothers have pulled this off is astounding. Their are highs and there are lows, you’ll cry and you’ll cheer. With Nuanced characters, strong performances and as always genuine humour. From Star Lord and Tony Stark’s trying to out do each other to Spider-man and Dr Strange’s awkward moments... again, it all just works. And Thanos... what a great villain. Finally they have introduced someone with hidden depths and purpose. DC should take note. Or maybe they should just do something different. A couple of issues to note. Some of our ‘Avengers’ don’t get much screen time but in the main they are juggled nicely. Inevitable plot holes remain, but I suppose that’s what happens with 20 years of story telling. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed it and I will be agonising for the next 12 months for the sequel!

It was absolutely insane. Marvel did a really good job keeping the stakes high, it was exhilarating. It barely left room for a breather. Thanos was the amazing villain we were all waiting for, probably the best one ever. Thor is still amazing, best hero in the movie. Spider-man was great. Dr. Strange was really funny I loved all of his new moves and powers. Favorite quote: \"Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian. And for another, we have the Hulk!\" The ending was extremely effective and traumatising. I had very few problems with this movie. Definitely feels like part 1 of 2. 91/100. Great job MCU, keep it up. Can't wait for Avengers 4!!!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/438481416600109/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-04T04:52:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-04T04:56:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"977256139","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977256139"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"After many sometimes weak and a bit predictable episodes, this film is bringing all the cogs together, orchestrating them in a coherent manner.
