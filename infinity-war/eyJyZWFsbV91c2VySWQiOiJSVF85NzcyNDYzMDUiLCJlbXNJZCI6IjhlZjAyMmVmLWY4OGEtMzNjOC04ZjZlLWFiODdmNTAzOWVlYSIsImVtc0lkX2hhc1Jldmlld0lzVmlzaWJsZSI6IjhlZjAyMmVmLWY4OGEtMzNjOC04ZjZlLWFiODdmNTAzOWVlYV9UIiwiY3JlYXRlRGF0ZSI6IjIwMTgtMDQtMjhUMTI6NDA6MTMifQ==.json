I think the issue is the avengers are just so boring. In this movie they bring everyone in, not just the core avengers (though no ant-man). This is the most Zack Snyder-ie Marvel movie ever. It's dark, light on jokes and depressing. After seeing it, didn't feel super compelled to see how this story resolves itself. \n\nEveryone was fine as usual, the cast was great. Also, the biggest surprise of all was CG villain didn't look like crap. It was amazing how good he looked. They even animated nape hair on Brolin. Maybe DC should hire these guys for their films. Even when the screen was littered with CG aliens it didn't look bad. Only time it was bad was with Thanos's acolytes were on screen, they clearly didn't get as much time and detail spent on them. \n\nThe story was fine and it was nice to see a movie end on a downer that's also a blockbuster. Half of the universe gets destroyed, the lamer avengers including spider-man dies, hawkeye and and ant-man don't make an appearance, maybe they're dead too like Nick Fury in the post credit scene. Oh spoiler, Nick Fury PAGES Captain Marvel on a motorola looking pager with stuff half-assedly glued onto it to make it \"sci-fi\". You see her logo fill up the LCD on the pager which looked monochromatic like they were back then, and yet manages to magically display color. I guess they didn't think they could achieve the same effect leaving the Captain Marvel logo in teal-scale. \n\nDeaths include: Bucky, Gamora, Groot, Drax, Spider-man, Dr Strange, half-of-the-universe, Black Panther, Scarlet Witch, Vision\n\nLiving left: Rocket, Gamora's sister, Peter Quill/Star Lord, IronMan, Captain America, Hulk, Thor (he gets a badass axe from Peter Dinklage enlarged to a 20ft Dwarf, it cleaves Thanos), Warmachine.

The comedic elements are genuinely funny. The action grips and it doesn’t feel like there is too much is going on with too many characters. Yes, it is not a stand alone movie and you have to see the next one to make sense of it all and you feel emotions that are ignored but that’s sort of the point.
