At the beginning of the film when they show all of the bodies of the people of Asgard, it focuses on each individual person as they walk by them. It adds to the intensity of it all and the overall sadness of it. Infinity War smashed box office records. So I would say it is extremely popular. \nThe moral of the movie to me was \"Who and what are you willing to personally sacrifice to accomplish your goal?\" Throughout the whole entire movie characters struggle with having to sacrifice certain people or things to achieve their end goal. First Heimdall sacrifices his own life to save Hulk. Then Loki sacrifices himself and the tesseract for Thor. Iron man leaves Earth to save Dr Strange. Groot cuts off his arm to save Thor. Thor almost dies to create the Stormbreaker. Gamora gives up the soul stone for Nebula. Thanos sacrifices Gamora for the soul stone. Dr Strange gives the time stone to Thanos to save Tony. Wanda kills vision so Thanos doesn't get the mind stone, which was in vain. Then at the end young Gamora asks Thanos \"Is it done?\" To which he responds \"Yes\" \"What did it cost?\" \"Everything\"\n\tThe main character in this movie is essentially Thanos. It is all about how he is trying to get the infinity stones. His internal conflict would have to be pride. Thinking that he knows what the universe needs, and refusing to see it any other way. The external conflict is basically everyone trying to stop Thanos.","displayName":"faith w","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-21T19:10:02.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-21T19:10:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"977281839","realm":"RT","displayName":"faith w","accountLink":"/user/id/977281839"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 21, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Kudos to the director to able to pull this off with so many stars and super heroes involve.
