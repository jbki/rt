The movie is centered around the villain, and takes a daring turn with its end, however that is all brought down by the knowledge that nothing will truly be final, as Disney would not allow many iconic characters to die and, potentially, limit the amount of sequels that can be made. The performances of almost all actors are incredible, notable of whom are Cris Pratt, Christ Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr. Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Holland and Tom Hiddleston gave immaculate performances. However, this movie is the movie in which Josh Brolin shines brightest of all the stars, giving an incredible performance that will, most likely, be remembered for long, long after this movie has been seen by the viewers.\nA sublime film, Avengers: Infinity War should be watched by everyone, so that they can re-experience respect for Super-Hero movies.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2270798253162703/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-26T10:32:52.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-26T10:38:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"977945689","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977945689"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"So good.
