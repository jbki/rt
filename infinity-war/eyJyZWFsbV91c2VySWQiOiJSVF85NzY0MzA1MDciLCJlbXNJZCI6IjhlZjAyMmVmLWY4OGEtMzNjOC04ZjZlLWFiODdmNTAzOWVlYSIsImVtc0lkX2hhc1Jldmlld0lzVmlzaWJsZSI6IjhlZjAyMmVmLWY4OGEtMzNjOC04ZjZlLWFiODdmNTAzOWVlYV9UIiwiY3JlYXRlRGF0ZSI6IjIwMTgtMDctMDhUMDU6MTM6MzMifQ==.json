He understands giving the fans scenes and shots and set pieces they have always wanted to see on screen. He also understands how to write and show these characters with established personalities interact. Those are the 2 main things this avengers is missing. Also im not a big fan of the guardians so that part i didn't care about much. Also it is part one of a 2 part story so there is a chance they stick the landing in Pt 2 and everything falls into place which would bring this movie up a notch. Thanos is a great character and is super well done. The fight scene on titan with thanos is the best action of this movie but the final epic battle does not live up to any other of the marvel movies.","displayName":"Alex W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000245110798/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-07T17:55:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-07T17:55:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"886931965","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex W","accountLink":"/user/id/886931965"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"it was really good lot of good fighting scenes good graphics good details kept me in my seat vary thrilling but the end was vary dull the ending could have been better","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-07T17:03:17.141Z","updateDate":"2018-07-07T17:03:17.141Z","user":{"userId":"260161065","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260161065"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best out of all the marvel films by far!!
