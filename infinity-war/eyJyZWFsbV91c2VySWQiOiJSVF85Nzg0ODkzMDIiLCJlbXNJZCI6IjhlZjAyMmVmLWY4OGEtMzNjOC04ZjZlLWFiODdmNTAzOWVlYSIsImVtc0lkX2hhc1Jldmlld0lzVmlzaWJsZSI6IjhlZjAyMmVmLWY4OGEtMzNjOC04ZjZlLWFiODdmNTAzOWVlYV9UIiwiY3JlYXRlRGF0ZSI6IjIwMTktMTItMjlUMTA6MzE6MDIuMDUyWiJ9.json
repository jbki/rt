Truly a crushing story that brings out the best in everyone onscreen especially RDJ. The CGI is next level and Thanos is the best villain this franchise will ever have with intriguing morals and a great story fueling his mission.","displayName":"Matt T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T14:59:37.088Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T14:59:37.088Z","user":{"userId":"977240209","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt T","accountLink":"/user/id/977240209"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Better than Endgame.","displayName":"John F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T11:32:23.957Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T11:32:23.957Z","user":{"userId":"978486694","realm":"RT","displayName":"John F","accountLink":"/user/id/978486694"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The MCU just gave us one of the best villain of the decade.","displayName":"Alex D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T05:22:19.484Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T05:22:19.484Z","user":{"userId":"978486035","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex D","accountLink":"/user/id/978486035"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"An amazing piece of special effects and the beginning to the end of the MCU","displayName":"Mike H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T23:31:51.439Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T23:31:51.439Z","user":{"userId":"976986116","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike H","accountLink":"/user/id/976986116"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"A pointless movie.
