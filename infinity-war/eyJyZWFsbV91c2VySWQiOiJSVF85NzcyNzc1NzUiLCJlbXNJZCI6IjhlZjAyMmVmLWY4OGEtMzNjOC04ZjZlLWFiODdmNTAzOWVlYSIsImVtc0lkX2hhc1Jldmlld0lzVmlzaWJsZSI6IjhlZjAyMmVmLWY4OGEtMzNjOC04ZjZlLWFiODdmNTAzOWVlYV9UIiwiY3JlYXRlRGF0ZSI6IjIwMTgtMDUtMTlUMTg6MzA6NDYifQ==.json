This is the largest ensemble ever that I have seen, and it works. \nThe basic plot is That Thanos is trying to retrieve the infinity stones and the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy must come together to stop them. Sounds like every other marvel movie ever in existence, and it kind of is so if have become disfranchised with marvel this movie will not do anything to persuade you otherwise. However, for those that are long time Marvel Movie fans, this film gives large amounts of payoff. \nWithout going into any spoilers (as the whole movie is one giant spoliation fest), I love the character interactions and how their attitudes and Ideologies play off of each other to create moments that range from the absolutely hysterical to the downright depressing. Thanos especially stands out as he is one of the best Marvel movie villains. His character is fleshed out substantial that you understand why he wants the infinity stones. the movie is also keeps up with a fast and furious (no reference to the sub pare car franchise) pace without felling to fast.   \nAlso, this movie is dark. Within the first five minutes, it is established that this movie is going to test how much these characters are going to go through in this movie. I think that the direction from the Russo Brothers helps substantially, as they have, by far, directed the two most dark MCU movies: Winter Soldier and Civil War. The long and medium shots give you the large scale that the movie aims to give while have those close personal moments between characters as well. \nThe score for this film is also one of Marvel's best, up there with the Guardians  of the Galaxy and Thor Ragnarok. Its epic and exciting, blending all the mostly forgettable superhero themes into one cohesion of epicness and deep emotion. \nHowever, this movie is not perfect. Some of the CGI is really shotty, especially in some of the super heavy CGI scenes with Thanos. The environments look great, but some of the Creatures look really fake. up close shots are usual the worse offenders where you get the most detail. Also, some character actions are literally just to further the plot, though some of them do make a lot of sense after a couple minutes of reflection. also, The movies like it ends abruptly, where there should have been more (and there is more we just have to wait another year).  \nConclusion: I recommend this as a great highly entertaining watch that would please most MCU fans. Though some of the CGi falls flat and has one of the biggest cliffhangers I have ever seen, This fill does so well with its characters and story that I cannot recommend it enough.","displayName":"Benjamin%20 B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-19T18:17:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-19T19:44:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"977277565","realm":"RT","displayName":"Benjamin%20 B","accountLink":"/user/id/977277565"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"The movie itself was fine but, the ending left me unsatisfied I excepted a resulted problem but left me with wanting the ending I believe the movie deserved but instead I got a crappy ending with a cliff hanger I didn't want.","displayName":"Jalil G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-19T17:34:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-19T17:44:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"977277510","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jalil G","accountLink":"/user/id/977277510"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was amazing.
