It was pretty good for a superhero movie.  To many characters involved, most of them we already know.  Just an endless string of cameos.  The villain, Thanos, was the most interesting character.

If you are like me, then don't fear, you can still enjoy the film perfectly well. If you have had no sort of introduction to the Marvel world or a limited one, then this movie will not be for you as it tells the story on the presumption that you know the Marvel universe that has been established in past movies.\nAs to the movie itself-it's easily the best Avenger movie and perhaps the best Marvel movie full stop. I was really dubious as to whether the film could manage all the different characters but it did and it made it look effortless. Saying that, some characters obviously got less screen time and development but luckily for me, most of those were my least favourite characters so it didn't concern me. However, if you're a big fan of Black Panther, Captain America, Black Widow and the Winter Solider, to name a few, then you may be a little disappointed. The dialogue was brilliant, the action scenes breathtaking and Thanos makes a great villain (finally we get one that isn't black and white). There were also dark, gut wrenching scenes here and some genuine surprises. A great movie and well worth a watch.","displayName":"Sinead K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-11T14:48:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-13T14:25:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"976992861","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sinead K","accountLink":"/user/id/976992861"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This is an amazing film, with an amazing story, awesome fight scenes, and so much more!","displayName":"John F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-11T14:25:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-11T14:28:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"977264901","realm":"RT","displayName":"John F","accountLink":"/user/id/977264901"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Poorly Written, Poorly Executed.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1694453987297860/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-11T14:03:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-11T14:03:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"977264886","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977264886"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely, Amazing!
