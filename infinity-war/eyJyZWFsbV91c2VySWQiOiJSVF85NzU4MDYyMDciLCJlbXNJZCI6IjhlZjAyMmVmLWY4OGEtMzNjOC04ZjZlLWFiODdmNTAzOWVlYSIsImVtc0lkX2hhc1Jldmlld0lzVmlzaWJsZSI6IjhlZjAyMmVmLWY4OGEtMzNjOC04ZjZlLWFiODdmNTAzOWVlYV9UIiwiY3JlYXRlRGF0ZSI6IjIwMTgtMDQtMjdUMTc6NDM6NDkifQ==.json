Infinity War just lifted the bar for action sci-fi superheroes movie. This movie is a amazing rollercoaster ride, story telling is near perfect with excellent actors, in particular the \"universe savings\" villain Thanos, near perfect cgi action scenes after action scenes with an unexpected climax which will make you wonder if this movie was really 2.5 hours long. For fans this must be everyone's wet dream, all Marvel heroes got their fair share excelling and exposing on the big screen.

The movie starts off so fast and with a bang, the whole movie feels like a rush of adrenaline and keeps you on the edge.
