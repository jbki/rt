The leading antagonist (Brolin) could potentially challenge Heath Ledger's maniacal depiction of the Joker. This is not because Thanos is a megalomaniac and indomitable being, but his excellency lies rational.  He is deft and absolute in both words and actions. He displays something inexplicably and hauntingly human about him. Thus, making him a fully realized anti-hero.\nAlan Silvestri's beautiful layered soundtrack heightens the emotional intensity of the Avengers greatest threat to date. His ability to capture the constantly changing tone and as the inextricably linked narrative jumps from place to place is deserving of praise. \nThe Russo's Infinity Wars (Part 1) is sure to become a pop culture reference of the future, as they have managed to achieve with the Thanos and the Avengers what Bryan Singer failed to do with Apocalypse (a character of banal platitude) and the X-Men. But we are left with our appetites unsated, and waiting with both repressed clamour and bated breath for the conclusion of the enthralling and dynamic journey in 2019.\n-TJ","displayName":"Tenzel  J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T13:39:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T13:40:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243310","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tenzel  J","accountLink":"/user/id/977243310"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Cant Wait to see the Avengers","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/208211303117633/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T13:39:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T13:40:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243394","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977243394"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"in short, it was amazing.
