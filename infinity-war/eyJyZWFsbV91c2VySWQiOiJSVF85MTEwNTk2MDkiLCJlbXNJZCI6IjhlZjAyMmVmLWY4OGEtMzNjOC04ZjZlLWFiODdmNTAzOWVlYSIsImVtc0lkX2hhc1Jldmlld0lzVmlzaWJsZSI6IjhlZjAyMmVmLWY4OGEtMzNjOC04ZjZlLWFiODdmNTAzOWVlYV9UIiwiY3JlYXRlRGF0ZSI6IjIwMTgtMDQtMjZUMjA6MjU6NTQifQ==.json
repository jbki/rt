Can't wait to see it again to pick up on things I missed (thanks SMG for being the most distracting environment to see a movie EVER).  And Captain Marvel and Avengers 4 can't come out soon enough!!!!\n\nAnd yes - one bonus scene at the very end of the credits.  After sitting still for 150 minutes, do yourself a favor and go use the bathroom before that scene.  Trust me - you have time.","displayName":"Don D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000338772861/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T20:24:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T20:30:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"889628085","realm":"RT","displayName":"Don D","accountLink":"/user/id/889628085"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I can barely breathe.

It left the crowd wondering and wishing for more than they had been presented with. The quick change in story lines took me out of the moment while also leaving you with a sick, unfinished taste in your mouth.  While this movie was enjoyable, it can he considered as one of the worst endings of all time in marvel history.","displayName":"Santa K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T20:22:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T20:27:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"975830648","realm":"RT","displayName":"Santa K","accountLink":"/user/id/975830648"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Infinity War delivers everything I've been waiting for, for the past decade. I can't stress how well Thanos was done and the feelings I had for him by the end of the movie.

When they are trying to remove the super weapon from the villain they could have just cut off his arm instead.  The ending was extreme and terrible and we were all disappointed.
