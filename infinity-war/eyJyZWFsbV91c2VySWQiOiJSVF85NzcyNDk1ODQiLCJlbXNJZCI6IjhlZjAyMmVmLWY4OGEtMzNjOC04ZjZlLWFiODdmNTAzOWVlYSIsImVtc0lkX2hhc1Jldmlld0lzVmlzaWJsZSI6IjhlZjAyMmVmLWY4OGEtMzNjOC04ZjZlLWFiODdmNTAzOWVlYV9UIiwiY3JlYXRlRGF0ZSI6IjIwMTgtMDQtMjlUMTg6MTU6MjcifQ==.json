Issues: - the Phantom Menace droid attack on Naboo - Iron Man’s nano suit doesn’t gel with the feel of previous movies - mass genocide ultra powerful Thanos could have killed all the avengers by hand but just let them off. - the Avengers could have ended things but didn’t - Some Avengers were underused or wasted - Cap, Wakandians, and the Guardians Stand out moments - - Hulk getting the gamma smacked out of him so he sulks through the whole movie - Strange’s only way plan... - Drax and Groot - as always","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T18:11:18.164Z","updateDate":"2018-08-07T06:57:44.664Z","user":{"userId":"924110696","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/924110696"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Utterly awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T18:07:31.625Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T18:07:31.625Z","user":{"userId":"260024274","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260024274"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Didn't think marvel could top Winter Soilder or Thor Ragnarok.

I've suffered from major Superhero movie burnout for years.
