It takes great risks, and manages to give the audience what they want. It is completely original, and marvel+Russo brothers have made a non-formulated film. We explore the bad guy more than the good, and it is written in a way that you understand his burden to believe what he \"needs\" to do is right. This film is tremendously unexpected, and no film to date has accomplished all of these feats.","displayName":"Chanse B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T20:37:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T20:40:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"975664392","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chanse B","accountLink":"/user/id/975664392"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie of the decade","displayName":"Janisar A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T20:36:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T20:38:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247265","realm":"RT","displayName":"Janisar A","accountLink":"/user/id/977247265"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The very fact that this movie has come after 15 interlinked Marvel successful movies before shows how carefully this was planned and to say the least, a successful execution indeed. It is definitely not easy to have so many superheroes in one movie sharing screen times in such way that no one steals other's thunder and this has been done remarkably in this movie. A strong villain is the main key to any movie and Thanos has been superbly portrayed as one.

Is. Freaking. Amazing. This film echoes brilliance in every category. Storytelling. Visual effects. And most importantly emotion. This movie handles fight scenes and character interactions so well it's like it's right out of the comics. This film will leave a lasting impact on you long after you leave the theatre and is satisfying despite its bitter appearance. This movie is funny as hell and knows exactly when to switch to drama that puts you on edge. It's brutal nature is established from the start and keeps you on edge till the very end, where it pays off in a bittersweet finale. Only gripe, and it is a minor one, is its constant cuttting back and forth can be somewhat difficult to keep track of. Despite this, it is a phenomenal film that everyone should witness.","displayName":"Zachary W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T20:36:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-31T12:07:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"977003913","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zachary W","accountLink":"/user/id/977003913"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it.

Not my favorite film in the MCU, as it leaves a bitter taste in the mouth toward the end, but as that was the goal, it was achieved very well. Logan (the film) reminded people that heroes can die, and this film took that concept up to 11. Most of my predictions were busted up, and the film delivered on a villain that truly gave the MCU a deep sense of dread that had yet to be felt by any other.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1345313105569119/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T20:32:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T20:37:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247257","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977247257"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was one of the best Marvel movies.
