I was relieved that the movie actually accomplished a fairly seamless intergration of the existing threads. By the end the viewer forgets the absurdity of the magnitude of backstories and personalities in this movie and is left enjoying a well executed project that earned its place in history.\n\nThe MCU asks that you leave your smugness at the door and just accept that they've accomplished something incredible. If you can do that, this film will not disappoint.","displayName":"Eric R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T17:31:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T17:55:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"977230336","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eric R","accountLink":"/user/id/977230336"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great Movie can't til part 2","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T17:25:24.464Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T17:25:24.464Z","user":{"userId":"968380378","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/968380378"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"another dull Marvel movie.

Only have a few knit picks without getting too much in to spoilers. First: I wish they went deeper into Thanos’ justification for wanting half the universe destroyed. Second: there were many opportunities where Thanos could’ve just killed many of the Avengers but didn’t. Seemed like a bit of a cop out to bring the heroes face to face with death only to be spared.
