Why are so many enthralled with this movie?There are plot holes big enough to drive Trump's bloated body AND ego through, the dialogue is pure cheese, the acting is horrible, the action consists, mostly, of people making circles with their hands. The characters seemed more like badly drawn caricatures of themselves. The only good moments were provided by the Guardians.
