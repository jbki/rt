Every moment in this movie was packed with so much emotion. The result was an incredible combination of a satisfying and gut-wrenching feature. The only fault was the myriad plot points and the constant switching between these plot points in the first act of the movie, creating an uneven tone. The themes of sacrifice and revenge which have been recurring throughout the MCU are nuanced to perfection in this movie.","displayName":"Abhi E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T23:00:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T23:13:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"977244715","realm":"RT","displayName":"Abhi E","accountLink":"/user/id/977244715"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome movie!!!!  ??","displayName":"C S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T22:59:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T23:02:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"977244714","realm":"RT","displayName":"C S","accountLink":"/user/id/977244714"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"30-40 minutes overlong, numerous scenes that could have been cut, the thrill of seeing all the superheros on screen together wears out fast enough, and the average at best story leaves little room for imagination.

Anthony & Joe Russo (Directors of Captain America 2&3, including Avengers 3&4) have really given us everything in terms of what the MCU big baddie Thanos is suppose to be and bring. An epic that will go down in history and one for the books. #ThanosDemandsYourSilence","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1183918385078324/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T22:56:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T23:09:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"977244711","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977244711"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
