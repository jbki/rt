While it definately has the over-the-top humerous comments and antics you expect from characters like Thor and Star Lord, I found much of it - and not just the ending - to be overly depressing.\n\nWell, given the direction in which the story was headed, it kind of had to be, right?  Still - just being honest here - I enjoyed the movie less as a result.  It didn't quite achieve the... balance of tone that a really good move that ends on a bad point - like The Empire Strikes Back - needs to achieve.\n\nSo while this film is definately wothy of a viewing - and I'm certainly eager to see where things end up in next year's follow up offering - I very much doubt I'll be watching this film a second time, as I have with so many other films in the Marvel space.\n\nAs such, I award Avengers Infinity War 3 1/2 out of 5 stars.  Thanks to everyone involved with the film!","displayName":"Timothy K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-09T14:07:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-10T06:08:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"977262794","realm":"RT","displayName":"Timothy K","accountLink":"/user/id/977262794"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was an excellent movie!

Ngl. I was spoiled about parts of the ending scene, but that didn't really ruin the movie for me anyways.\n\nI honestly think it was an amazing movie, with really likable characters, great humour that mostly doesn't feel forced, beautiful shots and effects, and a plot and ending that left all 10 of us guys that went to watch the movie with our mouths wide open saying \"WOOOOW\", even though some of us knew parts of the ending.\n\n5/5 for me, definitely go watch it if you can :) - But do watch the movies before this one... anything else would just be silly. x)","displayName":"Thomas T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-09T13:29:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-10T13:35:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"977262762","realm":"RT","displayName":"Thomas T","accountLink":"/user/id/977262762"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"In a way, this movie expands on every aspect that has come to define the MCU over time - including the bad ones. To counter that though, is the dizzying amount of visual spectacle; heroes; and gags, and interwoven with each other they constitute one of the grandest and most daring films of its kind. Sure, it's the first of two parts, and that realization dampens some of the emotional impact of the movie's conclusion before long, but even then, 'Infinity War' is awesome and it earns my respect for being what it is.","displayName":"Vasco M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-09T13:07:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-09T13:12:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"906938671","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vasco M","accountLink":"/user/id/906938671"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Not the best Marvel movie, but action-packed and entertaining.","displayName":"Nicholas B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-09T13:04:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-09T13:05:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"977128399","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nicholas B","accountLink":"/user/id/977128399"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fantastic fun action movie.
