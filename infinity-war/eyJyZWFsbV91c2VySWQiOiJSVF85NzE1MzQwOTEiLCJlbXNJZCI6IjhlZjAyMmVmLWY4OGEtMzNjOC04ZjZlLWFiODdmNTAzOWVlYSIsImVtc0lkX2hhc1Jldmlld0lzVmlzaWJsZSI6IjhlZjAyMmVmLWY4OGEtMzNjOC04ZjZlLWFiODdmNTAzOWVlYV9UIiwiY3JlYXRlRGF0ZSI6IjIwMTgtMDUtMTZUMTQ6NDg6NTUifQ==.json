The Hulk was only in it for a moment and the Bruce Banner was in a big Ironman suit the rest of the movie.  Captain American was dressed all in black with 2 small black shields.  Didn't even look like Capt. America ought to look.  He needs to be in red/white and blue AKA America!!!   Fight scenes are to long and I fell asleep once.  Then the ending sucked, I know it is just for a sequel, but a movie this long needed a ending, it is already obvious there will be more.  I will watch the next one on DVD.","displayName":"KarlandLaura D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1160498804021753/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-16T12:12:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T12:23:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"974971948","realm":"RT","displayName":"KarlandLaura D","accountLink":"/user/id/974971948"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A great addition to the MCU and this shows just how great the MCU is.

The movie starts out with decent enough character and pacing, and continues to build until the plot and character decisions spiral wildly out of control. I would describe it as â??ultimately tiresomeâ??.  The key to success, in my opinion, is for the film to not take itself too seriously, which with so many character identities to protect, can be quite the task, but a task which I believe Infinity War succeeds in through small interactions, but fails at in grand arc.","displayName":"Aaron A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/689105323/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-16T11:05:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T11:05:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"788139723","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aaron A","accountLink":"/user/id/788139723"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 16, 2018"}]}
