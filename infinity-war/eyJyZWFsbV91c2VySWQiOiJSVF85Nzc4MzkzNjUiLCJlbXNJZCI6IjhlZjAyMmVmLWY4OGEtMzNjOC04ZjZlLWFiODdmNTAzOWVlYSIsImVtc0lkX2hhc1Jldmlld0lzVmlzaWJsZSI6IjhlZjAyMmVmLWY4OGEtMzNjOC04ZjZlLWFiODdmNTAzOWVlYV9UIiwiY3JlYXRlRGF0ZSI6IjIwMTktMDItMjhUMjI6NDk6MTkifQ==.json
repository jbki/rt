Every scene matters.  Every line of dialogue matters.  Every interaction matters.  Thanos is the ultimate villain, and his portrayal is flawless!  Every good villain, has a justified means to an end.  Where they truly believe they are doing what is right.  Thanos' motivations actually make sense, in a twisted way, which makes this story all the more compelling.  The good guys don't always win either.  Easily the best of all the MCU films.","displayName":"Beau H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2029352157119809/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-02-27T21:06:57.000Z","updateDate":"2019-07-03T04:28:34.780Z","user":{"userId":"977743002","realm":"RT","displayName":"Beau H","accountLink":"/user/id/977743002"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome film.

EVERYTHING, technically, is perfect. Even though I had only two flaws, they didnâ(TM)t affect my enjoyment of this film. The film also understands that sometimes, even when you try your hardest, IT NEVER PAYS OFF. It may seem like that in the long run, but the film shows it will DEFINITELY not be like that for long at all. Itâ(TM)s so relatable and resonant to whatâ(TM)s going on with me at school in math. Itâ(TM)s astonishing to see that The Russo Brothers accomplished this mammoth of a film. If you havenâ(TM)t guessed already, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is the MARVEL EPIC that youâ(TM)ve been looking for, for a DECADE. Itâ(TM)s finally here.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/356899738245172/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-02-27T18:32:03.000Z","updateDate":"2019-02-27T18:33:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"977855617","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977855617"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Hilarious and action-packed, Avengers Infinity War juggles tens of characters seamlessly and delivers an amazing spectacle of visual effects and storytelling.","displayName":"Chrisp T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-02-27T09:02:38.000Z","updateDate":"2019-02-27T09:07:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"977118724","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chrisp T","accountLink":"/user/id/977118724"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"will definitely not support Marvel or Disney anymore","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-02-27T04:53:07.963Z","updateDate":"2019-02-27T04:53:46.206Z","user":{"userId":"260126329","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260126329"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"managed to really impress myself and the general public.
