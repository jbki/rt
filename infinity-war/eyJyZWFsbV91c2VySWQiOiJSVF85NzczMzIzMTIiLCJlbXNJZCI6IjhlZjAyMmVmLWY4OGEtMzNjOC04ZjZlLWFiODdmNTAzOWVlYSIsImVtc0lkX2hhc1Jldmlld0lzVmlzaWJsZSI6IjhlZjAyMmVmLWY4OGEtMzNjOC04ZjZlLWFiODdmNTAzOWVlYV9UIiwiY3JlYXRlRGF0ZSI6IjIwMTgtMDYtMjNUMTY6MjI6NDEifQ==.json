They sped through and got to the good action, which was fun and long-awaited. However, I felt like it was not as epic as it could have been when it comes to the plot and characters, since it had so much to pack in. The ending also felt like a cop-out, I know these disappearing heroes will be back. \nSome points were glossed over throughout the story but sitting in the audience I barely had a second to ask wait, what? before the scene shifted along with my focus. Still, the movie is a fun ride, just could have made more of an impact.","displayName":"Elizabeth S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-23T13:56:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-23T13:56:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"976395243","realm":"RT","displayName":"Elizabeth S","accountLink":"/user/id/976395243"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 23, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Russo brothers made a risky move and it just made me speechless and emotional.","displayName":"Josiah Y","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-23T12:22:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-23T12:26:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"976124289","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josiah Y","accountLink":"/user/id/976124289"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 23, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"SUMMARY IN BRIEF\nUp till now, the evil Thanos and the infinity stones have been in the background of all the many Avenger movies and their sub stories for what seems to be like eons.  Now those two elements are front and center.  The huge list of Marvel Superheroes must somehow come together to defend against Thanos' lust for the Infinity Stones in order to save the universe.  Thanos even with his ball sack like chin is probably the best villain us sci-fi and action/adventure freaks have had in a long time, maybe since Darth Vader. He is someone you love to hate and he even has a few surprises that blind side you on his journey toward universal domination.  See this film in 3D and amp up your experience.  However, if you have children, be forewarned.  Most of the Marvel films so far have been cotton candy and popcorn drama but this is more intense and more severe drama.  I'm not talking violence, sex or swearing but emotional drama.  A child well under the age of the 13 was next to me in this film crying, and I hear that across aboard.  This is a great super hero movie for those 13 and above because it is a darker one.  Think of the film \"The Watchman\". It is that kind of cool and that kind of dark.  All we are missing is a big blue man flinging a blue penis around like Dr. Manhattan did.  While there is a butt load of humor, great cinematic scenes of interplanetary scope, awesome characters and three hours of continuous action, there isn't just a whole lot of shaking going on, there is a lot of sacrifice and emotional suffering going on as well.  Also, if you have not seen many of the films prior, you aren't going to get much out of this. Investment in pre-established characters is highly recommended.  This, after all, is an Avenger's class reunion. It is a thrill ride like something out of a Universal Studios theme park at points (especially in 3D).  It is a movie you won't soon forget.  I don't agree that there are too many characters in this film. Everyone is perfectly placed.  It is only a lot if you have no investment here.  The only slightly small draw back is the ending leaves us not only wanting more but it isn't a very happy ending at all.    It is a severe ending that may be rectified in future installments of which we are promised.  Even so, the severity for adults will be somewhat of a welcome one in that this film ends in a way that most films coming out of Disney dare not to.  Despite three hours, you still want to see more in future films just because the ending alone. You've got it all here. Go see this film. \n\nFor a more detailed review, got to my webpage at www.gotwords.org","displayName":"Larry J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-23T12:17:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-23T12:17:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"977332022","realm":"RT","displayName":"Larry J","accountLink":"/user/id/977332022"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 23, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good acting, story, and special affects.","displayName":"James J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-23T11:04:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-23T11:05:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"977331958","realm":"RT","displayName":"James J","accountLink":"/user/id/977331958"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 23, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Infinity war part 1 is the best movie from 2018 (for now).
