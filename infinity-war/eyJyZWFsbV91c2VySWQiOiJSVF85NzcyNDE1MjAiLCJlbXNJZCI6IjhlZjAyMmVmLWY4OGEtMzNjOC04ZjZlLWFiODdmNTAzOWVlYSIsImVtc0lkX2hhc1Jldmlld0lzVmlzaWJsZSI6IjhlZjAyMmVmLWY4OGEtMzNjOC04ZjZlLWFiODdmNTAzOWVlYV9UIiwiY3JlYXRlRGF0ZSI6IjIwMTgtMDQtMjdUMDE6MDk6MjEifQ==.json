With such a large cast if left very little airtime for anyone's character to develop. Key characters make poor choices and dont utilize their abilities for the sake of drama.\n\nGreat Production: 2 Stars\nA lot of time went into CGI. This is largely what the movie consists of and it does a good job.

While the action is exciting, and a rollercoaster, there is a lack martial art which has popped up in other Avenger movies. Also with a super dooper 'baddy' fight scenes against Thanos seem pretty pointless and other certain flaws.\nFlaws are certainly abound in the plot and leaves you less than emotionally for the characters. Maybe as with each character that crumbles into the wind, might as well be dollars they would be losing if any of it was true. \nThe start of the movie, was too STAR WARS NEW HOPE, maybe a statement that they hope to compete with that franchise. A bad move, the movie seems to steal many things from Star wars and LoTR / Warcraft in a weird space mix. It didnt quite work. But for Star Wars fans, we have a back story for emperor Snope. Ironman pushed him into space and he floated away into a galaxy far far away. \nOnly one character had any real character progression and that was the Green chick and perhaps Thanos. \nThanos, was a great baddy with all the aspects you expect but an ideology, like with the black panther, that is not purely evil. Thanos is not seeking in some melomaniac way all power for the universe but balance and the betterment of races. In a Socratic esq. way the curse of knowledge was certainly exposed in the movie, yet poorly done and not referred to enough.\nThe scene jumping didnt work for me, up until maybe halfway through. The green chic as a child was the prime example of the scene being almost random.\nI feel for the money spent on the movie, and the action scenes which are very impressive. However it the plot is deeply flawed,","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10211210246548388/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T01:03:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T01:32:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241509","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977241509"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"They pulled it off.
