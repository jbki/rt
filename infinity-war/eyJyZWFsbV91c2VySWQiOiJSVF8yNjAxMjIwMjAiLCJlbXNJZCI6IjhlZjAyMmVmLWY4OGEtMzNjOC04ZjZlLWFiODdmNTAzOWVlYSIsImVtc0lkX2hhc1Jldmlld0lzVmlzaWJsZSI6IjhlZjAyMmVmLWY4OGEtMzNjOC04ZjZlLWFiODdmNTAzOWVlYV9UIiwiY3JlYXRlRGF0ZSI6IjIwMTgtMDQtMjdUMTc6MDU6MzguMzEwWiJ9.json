I have to say, it had some things I did expect, and many other things that totally surprised me. I reccomend watching the other movies first to get the best experience, but it's understandable if you haven't. I'm going to need a moment before I can forgive the Russo's for messing with my emotions on this one. I loved it, and I can't wait for the next movie! Fair warning: this is a two parter. There's still Acengers 4.

Worth the 10 year wait! My only complaint is that the MCU has screwed up  The Hulk beyond repair.

The CGI was obviously top notch, and they somehow managed to coherently piece together a story that had over 20 major characters, each with their own in-depth storyline. I've never seen a movie before this one that felt this ambitious, had this much money behind it, and then fully delivered. A definite must-see, even if just for the spectacle of it all.","displayName":"Patrick M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T17:03:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T17:33:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243888","realm":"RT","displayName":"Patrick M","accountLink":"/user/id/977243888"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome!
