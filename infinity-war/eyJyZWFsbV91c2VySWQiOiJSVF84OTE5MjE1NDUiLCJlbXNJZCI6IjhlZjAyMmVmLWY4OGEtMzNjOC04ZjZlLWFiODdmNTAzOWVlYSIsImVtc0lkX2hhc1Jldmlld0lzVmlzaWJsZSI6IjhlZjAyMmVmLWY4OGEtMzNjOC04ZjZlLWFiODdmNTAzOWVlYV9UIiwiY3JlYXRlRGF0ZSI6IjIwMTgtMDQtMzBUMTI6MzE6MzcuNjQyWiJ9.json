For example, what was the point of Thor Ragnarok?? Why go to all that... I just feel this latest installment tried to do too much and incorporate too much and the universe that is the MCU, like a supernova, radiated strong from the start, but is now collapsing on itself. As a spectacle film it was fine. But as a culminating film it was weak.","displayName":"Dammes H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T12:27:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T12:30:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"930066577","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dammes H","accountLink":"/user/id/930066577"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Thanos dies in the first act","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T12:26:13.142Z","updateDate":"2018-06-23T17:43:00.325Z","user":{"userId":"953866391","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/953866391"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Lots of heroes, and lots of fun.

Was it as good as a stand alone movie like Winter Soldier or Guardians?  No.  But this was never going to be a stand alone movie.  This was  the middle of a trilogy where the first act (s) were all the movies that built up to this.  This was the second act  and in that regard the fact that they could bring it all together gets 5 stars from me.  I don't think this will ever be replicated in our lifetime as it was a monumental undertaking over 10 years and 18 films in the making.\n\nSo what are the must see movies going into this?  At a bare minimum Civil War and Thor Ragnarok.  Then you have all the rest.\n\nStay for the post credit Stinger.\n\nThis movie has equal parts humor, hero conflict, joy, loss, easter eggs and cool fight scenes that we come to expect from a Marvel movie.\n\nMany have said that this was Thanos's movie and I would ten to agree, great arc for him that had a huge payoff.\n\nThere were numerous moments when the whole audience cheered.  There were also moments when people cried out in disbelief and tears were shed.  It was that intense and the stakes have never been higher in the MCU.  Marvel Studios and everyone involved exceeded this fans expectations.\n\nIn a word: Excelsior!","displayName":"Greg H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/679351679/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T12:23:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T12:34:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"875681270","realm":"RT","displayName":"Greg H","accountLink":"/user/id/875681270"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"5 STEP FILM REVIEW\n- 1.Strengths: Passionate characters, breathtaking action scenes and a hauntingly unexpected ending.\n-2. Weaknesses: Crowding of plot lines and characters, inconsistent pacing and forgettable supporting cast members.\n-3. See it if: You are either a new or long time MCU fan looking to see all of your favorite characters fight against their greatest threat yet.\n-4. Don't see it if: You are a casual super hero movie fan and you expect this film to be completely coherent as your first Marvel experience.\n-5. General Statement: Infinity War is a fantastic, terrifying and enormous culmination of ten years of narrative and character development and it never forgets that fact, even if  it lets that fact overshadow the under use and under development of certain characters and plot threads.","displayName":"Robert M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T12:22:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T12:33:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"977251109","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert M","accountLink":"/user/id/977251109"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"will make you cry 9.9/10","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/856898871181888/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T12:22:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T12:22:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"977251114","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977251114"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Definitely the best all around Marvel movie I've watched so far. I was worried that with the amount of characters in this movie would it would turn out to be a giant mess but the directors made it work!

The action scenes were intense and well crafted, especially when the heroes are synchronizing their attacks to stop a foe.
