I had fun watching all the fight scene and I especially had fun watching it a second time and hearing the rest of the audiences reactions. My only real problem was some bad cgi work (my main example is whenever Mark Ruffalo is in the hulk buster suit without the helmet on because it just never looks like he is actually there to me). A real enjoyable movie with some good emotional moments.","displayName":"Michael H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-03T21:06:09.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-03T21:11:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"977345508","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael H","accountLink":"/user/id/977345508"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This movie took a huge risk, and it made it work.
