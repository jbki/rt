It is funny , climatic and sad too as well. It has a lot of humor and a lot fight scenes to see. Thanos is really one of the most interesting villain in the movie because of his personality and power. The saddest part of the movie is that when Thanos snaps his fingers he disintegrated half of the universe and some of the superheroes even my favorite Marvel superhero Spider Man.\n\nBut still its a really great movie to watch","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1871034926268663/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-30T17:21:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-30T18:22:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977380654","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977380654"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Non Stop pop Movie!!!","displayName":"Ger K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/666835475/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-30T16:32:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-30T16:33:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"889688613","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ger K","accountLink":"/user/id/889688613"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Boring, Dumb story.

Unsurprisingly, Infinity War is for the fans only. This film is fast, complexly woven to incorporate all the characters, their relationships and dynamics over an overarching tale of a MEGA super-power coming to destroy the world (surprise). The biggest achievement is that they took the time to build the antagonist, which has been a low point for most of the MCU films. With perspective Infinity War means much more and provides enough thought to match the visual spectacle of battle. Yup, so pretty dang good. It's a must see for any Marvel fan.","displayName":"Jimmy J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-29T17:46:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-06T05:35:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"900802687","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jimmy J","accountLink":"/user/id/900802687"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Critics are stupid.
