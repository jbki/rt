Aside from having incredible VFX and a great dose of thrilling action, what keeps this dizzying culmination of the MCU from becoming an unwieldy bloat is the Russo Brothers' fluid directing and the emotional depth that each actor brings to their character. Arguably a bigger task for the film's success is showcasing Thanos as a real treat and he is downright awesome; a vividly menacing but compelling villain that elevates the stakes considerably, all the way to the movie's stunning conclusion.","displayName":"Christopher B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T12:08:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-02T22:12:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"905573906","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christopher B","accountLink":"/user/id/905573906"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Not the best Marvel Universe movie.

CGI was terrible (I hate CGI mind you.)  For me the humor often missed the mark and often went for the cheep laugh.  One of the big dog characters should have been done in I would have enjoyed that.  I kept wanting superman to fly in and own everything lol.  However I'm a much bigger fan of DC than Marvel.  Anywho, yeah it was okay I thought the guy playing Thanoes did an amazing job.  I would much rather sit back and watch civil war or any of the recent DC movies.","displayName":"Kailey E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T11:04:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T11:16:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"977257943","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kailey E","accountLink":"/user/id/977257943"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Anthony and Joe Russo's Avengers: Infinity War is a perfectly enjoyable entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, filled to the brim with compelling comedy and adrenaline-inducing action that will leave Marvel gurus more than satisfied. Infinity War, however, loses some of its appeal to those not acquainted with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as it builds directly off events depicted in past films. The film also suffers from its nearly three-hour runtime, with the various subplots demanding too many shifts in the audience's attention. That being said, Avengers Infinity War is a great popcorn action movie with grandiose moments for Marvel enthusiasts.","displayName":"Isaac C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T10:55:00.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T11:12:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"976966405","realm":"RT","displayName":"Isaac C","accountLink":"/user/id/976966405"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Too long, Too many locations.
