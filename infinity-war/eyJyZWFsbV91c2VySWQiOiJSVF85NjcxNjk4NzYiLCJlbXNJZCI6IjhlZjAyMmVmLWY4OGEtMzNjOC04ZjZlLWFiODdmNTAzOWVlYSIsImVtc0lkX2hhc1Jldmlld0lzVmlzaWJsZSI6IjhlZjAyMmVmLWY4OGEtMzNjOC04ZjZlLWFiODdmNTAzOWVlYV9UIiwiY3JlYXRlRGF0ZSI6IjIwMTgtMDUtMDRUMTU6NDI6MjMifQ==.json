There are people that liked this? Who? How? My wife and I both reckoned it was one of the worst, perhaps the worst, film we had ever seen. \nThere are far too many characters for it to be possible to get interested in any one of them. Loads of superheroes is not better than one or two - what you get is dilution, not multiplication of the effect; not even addition. \nThe threat is incomprehensible and therefore no threat at all. Give me a couple and their 6-year-old child being held hostage and let me get to know them, and I'm emotionally involved. Threaten to kill half of the population of the universe, and I can't get my head round it. It doesn't have any emotional impact at all. \nThe film spends most of its time taking itself very seriously indeed. Then from time to time we are thrown a joke so weak that my children would sneer at it (they are young). \nThe giant mass of superheroes and attendant demi-heroes and the like has to be separated into smaller groups for there to be any hope of getting to the end of the uncountable plot lines. The result is that there are often two or more fight scenes going on at the same time. The direction of the fight scenes is chaotic and it would be hard to follow what was going on if there were only one at a time. Give us more than one, and we are without hope of getting an idea of what is going on. \nThe film seems to go on for hours. When the credits rolled at the end, nobody left. They seemed to be waiting for something more. If there was something more, I'm afraid I couldn't bear to hang around and wait for it. Much the best thing about this truly dreadful film is getting out of the cinema at the end.","displayName":"Stephen W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1088450352/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-04T15:18:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-04T15:32:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"816540381","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stephen W","accountLink":"/user/id/816540381"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome and sad.
