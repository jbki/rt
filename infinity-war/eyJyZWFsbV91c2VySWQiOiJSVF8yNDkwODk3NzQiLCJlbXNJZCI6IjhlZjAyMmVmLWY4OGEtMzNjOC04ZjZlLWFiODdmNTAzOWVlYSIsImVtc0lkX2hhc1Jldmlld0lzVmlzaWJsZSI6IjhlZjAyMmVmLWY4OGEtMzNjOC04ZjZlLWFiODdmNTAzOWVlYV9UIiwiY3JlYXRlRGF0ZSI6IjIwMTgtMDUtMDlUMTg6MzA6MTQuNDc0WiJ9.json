It had plenty of turns. As a fan of the original comics, I love it! The ending bit after the credits was a bit disappointing though, since the credits were so long for so little. I know that Marvel does it every time, but it was a bit boring. For the main movie though is a different story.

Any Marvel nerd will likely gawk, smile, and laugh at the anticipated character interactions and moments. Then again, it will also break your heart and maybe even leave you angry, but...in a good way, you know?  I thought the CGI/Mocap for Thanos was well done. it almost felt disturbing how real he looked/felt. His character's personality wasn't one dimensional or simply \"evil to be evil\", he had some depth and interesting motivations. The score also stood out, something that is often a complaint of marvel films.","displayName":"Rhi R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-09T16:53:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-09T17:00:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"977262917","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rhi R","accountLink":"/user/id/977262917"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent movie!
