Critics will have negative things to say about this movie and they will claim it’s “overkill”. True fans that have been loyal to the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the the past decade will know that this movie is a masterpiece that fits in with the others and rises above any expectations anyone had. This film is the most ambitious of its time and genre and the Russo brothers executed the story perfectly. The way all the characters are interwoven into the fabric of the story line is so masterfully done that I don’t know how anyone could write something negative about it. This movie is a 10/10 in my book and I cannot wait to experience it in all its glory again.
