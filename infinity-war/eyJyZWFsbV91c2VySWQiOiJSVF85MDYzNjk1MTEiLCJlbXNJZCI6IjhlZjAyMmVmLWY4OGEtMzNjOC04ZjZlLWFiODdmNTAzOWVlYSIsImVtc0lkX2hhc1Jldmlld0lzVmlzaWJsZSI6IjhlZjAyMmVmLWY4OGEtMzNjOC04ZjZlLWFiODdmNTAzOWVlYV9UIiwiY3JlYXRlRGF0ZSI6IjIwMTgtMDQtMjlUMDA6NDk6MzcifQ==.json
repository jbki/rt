Just another predictable Marvel movie that relies on jokes to draw the audience in.\n\nSFX: Well rendered. It was nothing special, but it was good enough to where it didn't become a distraction for me in any part of the movie.\n\n\nMusic: Very generic and forgettable. It killed a lot of what could have been tense moments.\n\nAction: Nothing special or memorable. You don't really feel the sense that you're dealing with super powered, or super enhanced, characters in this movie. It feels like a generic action movie. It also doesn't help that the characters are constantly cracking jokes throughout these tense moments, and it also doesn't help that the trailers revealed the best moments.\n\nStory: Very predictable, like all of these MCU movies. There was no real build up to the end of the movie; from the beginning to the end, it was just non-stop action and joke cracking, and this got old quick. There were very few moments of any real tension, or a sense of urgency and seriousness from the characters. \nThe plot was all over the place, and it was also just so poorly paced. \n\nHighlights: Josh Brolin was amazing as Thanos. \n\nLowlights: The amount of jokes in this movie, and the lack of a proper build up, really killed the sense of dread and urgency that should have been in this story.\n\n2.5/5","displayName":"Sacha P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T00:40:00.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T01:37:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247665","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sacha P","accountLink":"/user/id/977247665"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"NO SPOLIERS!!!!!!
