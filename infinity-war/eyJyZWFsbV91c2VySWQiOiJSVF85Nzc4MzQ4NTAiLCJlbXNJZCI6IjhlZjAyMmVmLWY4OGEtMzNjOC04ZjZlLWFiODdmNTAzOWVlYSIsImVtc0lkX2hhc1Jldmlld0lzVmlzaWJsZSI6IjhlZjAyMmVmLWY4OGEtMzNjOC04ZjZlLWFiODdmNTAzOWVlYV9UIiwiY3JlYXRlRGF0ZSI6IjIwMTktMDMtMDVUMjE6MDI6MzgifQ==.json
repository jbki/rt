I absolutely loved the film. Unlike a number of Marvel movies in the past they didn't overdue the comic moments. In all honesty some of the jokes in this movie were some of the best parts of the movie, namely the Drax character, if you've seen the film you know the scenes I'm writing about, pure gold in my opinion. Tons of great action, many great heroic moments for the likes of Cap, Thor, and many others. The movie made the stakes seem high and built tension well. The Russo Brothers have made some of the best MCU films, including the best of them all Captain America: Winter Soldier, as well as a film that with every repeated viewing grows on me more and more in Captain America: Civil War. Watching this makes me wish even more that Warner Bros had taken their time a little more and built up JL and of course Darkseid. The ten years of build up, starting from the first Ironman film in 2008 til this movie was well worth the wait. An outstanding comic book movie.","displayName":"Ron B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-05T13:02:12.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-05T13:09:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"901122965","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ron B","accountLink":"/user/id/901122965"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing movie...

My first reaction of it was absolute disappointment followed by extreme cravings on finding out what would happen next. Well, to be honest, I nearly cried in the end of the movie. This made buy more Marvel Comics that I think I first could've even afford. I realized after a short while that this movie, due to my reaction, is the most brilliant I've seen for a long while.","displayName":"Tomas T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-05T11:51:12.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-05T11:54:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"977866637","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tomas T","accountLink":"/user/id/977866637"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Most epic movie of the decade.
