Not a very threatening bag guy. Seems to contradict his evil attitude in the few cameos he had in the earlier movies.\n\n2.5 hours of punching and kicking... great for kids, but gets boring for adults. Plus the hulk had trouble fighting some bad guys, but black widow (who has no powers) could hold her own against the same bad guys. Not very well written.","displayName":"Michael B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-13T20:16:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-13T20:22:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"976971201","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael B","accountLink":"/user/id/976971201"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I'm very impressed with the MCU.  They have managed to do what so many have failed at.  MCU has come out with several great movies and they have set up their films from the beginning to lead up to an epic battle.  It was great to see so many heroes in a single movie.  The comedic routines were great!  I need not say anymore.  Great film!","displayName":"Teddy S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-13T19:56:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-13T20:03:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"977185679","realm":"RT","displayName":"Teddy S","accountLink":"/user/id/977185679"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The story is difficult to remember it's so complicated and has so many parts to it.
