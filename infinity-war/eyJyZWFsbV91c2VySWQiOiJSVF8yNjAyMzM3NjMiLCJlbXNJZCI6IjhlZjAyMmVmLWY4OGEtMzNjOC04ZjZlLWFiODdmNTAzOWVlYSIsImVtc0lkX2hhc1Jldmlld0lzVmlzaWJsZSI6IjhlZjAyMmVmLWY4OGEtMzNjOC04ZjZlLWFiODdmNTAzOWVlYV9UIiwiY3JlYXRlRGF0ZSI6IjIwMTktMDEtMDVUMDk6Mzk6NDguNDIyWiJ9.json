While I donâ(TM)t go running anymore, (bad knees), I would compare the film. To putting on a favorite pair of sneakers/trainers, and going for a really nice long run. Enjoying the experience in many ways. The action in the film is basically none stop, and well done. The acting is as good as it has to be, though no one character is dwelled on for too long. I laughed at some of the snappy, and well executed dialog. While I am a fan of the film series and Marvel. I did have some trouble, trying to remember, or understand, who some of the Avengers were. Itâ(TM)s easy to remember the Avengers who have had their own movies, like Iron Man, but Black Widowâ¦ Umm? It goes without saying, that CGI is first rate. Lastly, itâ(TM)s one of the few Superhero movies, that I didnâ(TM)t feel like I was being treated like a kid, and want something more âRâ? rated.","displayName":"Larry M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-05T07:38:14.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-05T07:43:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"965407696","realm":"RT","displayName":"Larry M","accountLink":"/user/id/965407696"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"It is a depressing movie.

Bad guy comes to town and kills everyone, and there isn't anything anyone can do about it. The End. I will say, fantastic effort getting all those characters in, in the most organic way possible. Good effort on that end. But IDK, these Marvel movies are starting to feel hollow to me. ok concept, ok execution. I probably will never rewatch by my own will.","displayName":"Erick F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-04T15:29:43.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-04T15:31:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"901304714","realm":"RT","displayName":"Erick F","accountLink":"/user/id/901304714"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I like Avengers: Infinity War.

I')m in such a daze of what the heck I just saw and I can't even begin to wrap my head around what exactly happened. Over the course of 2 hours and 40 minutes, The Russo brothers managed to cram in SO MUCH STORY into this 19th installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With over 25 superheroes, I honestly cannot fathom how the fuck they managed to pull this off, but PULL THIS OFF THEY DID.\n\nRead full review: jane-han.com/filmblog/2018/5/3/9tf7pkrmqjf4jv3h10vgw5ggl6ugch","displayName":"Jane H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-04T11:17:37.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-04T11:17:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"975889009","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jane H","accountLink":"/user/id/975889009"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"How is it possible to have so many strong characters in the same film at the same time and it not be a mess?
