I like the humour, the story, and the characters (even if I don't know a lot of the Marvel characters very well) - and I find it very amusing when the Guardians of the Galaxy meet The Avengers.\nLooking forward to Part 2 when it comes out.","displayName":"Tim W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T00:16:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-21T02:57:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"976896324","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tim W","accountLink":"/user/id/976896324"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I was going through a terrible  thrill andgoosebumps all over ...i must say,i am the lucky one to enjoy these awesome  thrills for these  10 years.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1817849578277524/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T00:15:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T00:18:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"977244878","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977244878"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Definitely a must see “event” for sure.
