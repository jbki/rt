No, you cant please everyone but if you walk away from Infinity War dissatisfied then you haven't paid enough attention. Bringing together all those characters and story lines whilst blowing our minds with special effects and new ideas plus keeping the plot exciting and compelling was a monumental task and Marvel studios have absolutely pulled it off. The movie is gripping, intense and the best part is when its done you have more questions than were answered. \nDon't try to watch it without watching all of the previous films in the MCU, it won't have the same effect. You have to be invested in the universe to understand how high the stakes are and to feel the full weight of the film and if you do you will agree that it was nothing short of a masterpiece. 10/10","displayName":"Jackson F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T16:44:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-25T16:57:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"977238596","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jackson F","accountLink":"/user/id/977238596"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Brilliant! 2.5 hours felt like 5 mins.

For the most part I love the way the characters were mixed up. The Thor and GotG dynamics were amazing. And the Dr. Strange, iron man & spider man scenes were worth the price of admissions alone.
