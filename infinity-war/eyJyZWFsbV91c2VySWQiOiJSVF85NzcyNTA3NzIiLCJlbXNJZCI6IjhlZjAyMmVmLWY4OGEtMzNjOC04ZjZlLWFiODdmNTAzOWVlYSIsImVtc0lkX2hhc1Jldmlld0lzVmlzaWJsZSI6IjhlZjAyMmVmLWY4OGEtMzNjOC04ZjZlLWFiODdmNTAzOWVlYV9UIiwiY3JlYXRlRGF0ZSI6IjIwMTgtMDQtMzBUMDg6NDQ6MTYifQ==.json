First off I can't say much about the visuals of the movie as I watched it in a rundown theatre with screening technology from decades back, so missed out on the CGI treat. Now for the plot, it's ambitious, I loved it and the story flow does fall into place but the execution was not what I expect from this franchise. With the grime start and stakes so high it felt like one of the DC dark movies (Justice League). Still, these guys tried to lighten the situation by giving us few of the signature MCU humor but cracking jokes just doesn't work after seeing heroes we have invested in, die.\n\nAnother thing which ticked me off was how Thanos henchmen were used, their powers seem too uneven, they were taken out in a manner which didn't work for me. As for Thanos himself, he should have been too powerful for anybody to put a hand on him, so some fight sequences, while fun didn't flow with the story. The best parts of the movie for me was the storytelling but most of the time we are just jumping from one action scene to another. Still, loved what they do in the end, brilliant stuff, this is truly only half a movie.","displayName":"Mayank A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/632865076/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T08:32:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T23:46:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"823123972","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mayank A","accountLink":"/user/id/823123972"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1924367747635814/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T08:32:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T08:32:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250755","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977250755"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it.

It all has built up to  this third Avengers: Infinity War film, and to me it didn't disappoint. Some people think that there is just too much going on with too many characters, but if you know anything about the source material it is exactly what it is supposed to be.  Thanos is really done well here, and so are his understudies. As a stand alone film I can see where folks would get lost with who is who, but as the 19th film in the Marvel Universe, we really needed to get to know Thanos and boy did we.  The fight scenes that included Thanos or just his minions were the best in the film.  I wasn't crazy about the what I would call Lord of the Rings huge battles.  I'm not giving this 5 stars because I also wasn't crazy about the Hulk/Bruce Banner role in the film (personal preference for sure).  Movies like The Hunger Games and Harry Potter and even The Hobbit split movies apart unnecessarily I feel, but I don't get this feeling here.  It is simply a third of four installments in the Avengers realm. I haven't felt the way I felt leaving a theater since Empire Strikes Back. Yes I am looking forward already to 365 or so days from now when the concluding story takes place.  There are more heroes and villains to come, and I don't think we have seen the last of those who are gone. I think it is hard to meet the expectations and build up Marvel has done over the last decade, but they pretty much did this time.","displayName":"Dave R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T08:29:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T08:30:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"907641493","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dave R","accountLink":"/user/id/907641493"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"What a gripping movie.
