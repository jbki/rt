Avengers: Infinity war is very ambitious with its dazzling visuals, and its emotional finale. All the cast was great and their performance was intriguing, entertaining:especially Chris Evens, Scarlett Johasson, Robert Downey Jr, Tom Holland, Elizabeth Olsen, Chris Pratt, Dave Batista,Zoe Saldana, Chris Hemsworth, and Josh Brolin as (Thanos.) The plot was excellent, it was very close to the comics, so it did justice in that department. Although Infinity war had its share of comedic entertaining feel, it also had a dark tone to it, which we don't see a lot in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Overall Avengers: Infinity War prt one was a emotional, dark, entertaining fun rollercoaster. I highly recommand this film for any MCU fans.","displayName":"Calvin R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/189521498092092/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2016-08-29T17:51:50.000Z","updateDate":"2019-02-21T10:50:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"973742983","realm":"RT","displayName":"Calvin R","accountLink":"/user/id/973742983"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 29, 2016"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Thanos wiped half of human population including our beloved Avengers heroes, i don't blame him though, if only he choose only the bad one such as criminals or whatever, but no, he also make spider-man and Doctor Strange to name a few to disappear too *sigh*.","displayName":"sari p","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2016-08-26T20:11:52.000Z","updateDate":"2019-02-15T23:07:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"817128724","realm":"RT","displayName":"sari p","accountLink":"/user/id/817128724"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 26, 2016"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is definitely the best of Marvel!!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2016-06-27T22:40:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T14:30:20.759Z","user":{"userId":"962985352","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/962985352"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 27, 2016"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The film hits the ground running by picking up the Marvel Cinematic Universe story about 20 minutes after Thor Ragnarok's post credits scene happened.  It was pretty much a series of third act action set pieces one right after the other the entire film.  Lots of weight, lots of emotion.  If you've read the comics you might have a guess as to what is coming (in some sense) as there are plenty of things that they took directly from the 1991 Infinity Gauntlet series and also the more recent Hickman \"Infinity\" story but tweaked a bit to fit the characters from the MCU.  For example, there is almost a direct cell by cell depiction of the beginning of the Infinity Gauntlet comic in the film but instead of Silver Surfer, it's Bruce Banner.  The film was very well done and while there are sure to be some gripes from some folks that there wasn't enough screen time for some of the newly beloved characters (Black Panther, etc) but really this was a culmination of the entire MCU which started with Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America so it is only fitting that they get the most screen time....  As far as the newest characters go, the most involved with the story are probably Dr Strange and Spider-Man.  This is not at all an issue with the film.  The interactions these characters have are incredible and Peter Parker and Stephen Strange are impeccably written by Marcus & McFeeley.  In total, actually, if you broke it down, the most screen time belongs to Thanos with Thor coming in 2nd.  Thanos is brilliant and the Russos did a superb job in trying to create this generation's Darth Vader in terms of his singular focus and ruthless methods.  Like Vader though (wanting to simply bring order to the galaxy), Thanos has a very believable motivation and one that he does not waver from no matter the personal cost to him (which is made clear in the film).  Overall great.  I really didn't think there would be anything in the MCU that was not only as action packed and entertaining but also a truly immaculate story as there was with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but Infinity War is it and goes above and beyond.","displayName":"Patrick W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/989855945691/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2016-06-22T09:01:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T11:40:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"804337894","realm":"RT","displayName":"Patrick W","accountLink":"/user/id/804337894"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 22, 2016"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Stellar movie.
