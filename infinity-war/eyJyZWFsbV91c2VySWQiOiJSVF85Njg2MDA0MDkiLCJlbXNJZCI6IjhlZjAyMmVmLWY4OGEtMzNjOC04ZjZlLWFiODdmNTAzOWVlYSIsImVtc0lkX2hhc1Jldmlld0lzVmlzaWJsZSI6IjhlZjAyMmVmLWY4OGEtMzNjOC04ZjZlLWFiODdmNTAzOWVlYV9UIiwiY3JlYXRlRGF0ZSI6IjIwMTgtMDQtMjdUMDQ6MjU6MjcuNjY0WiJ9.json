Bringing all the teams  together went smoothly and was really enjoyable. It's amazing how Marvel blends all those different genres (Guardians of The Galaxy, Thor, Avengers...) together in a coherent masterpiece. This movie left me in awe and desperately aching for more. It was a perfect blend of emotional and humoristic scenes. All the superheroes got their chance to shine. I'm definitely going to see this movie again - it's even better than Black Panther. Best movie in a looooong time.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2160582207502985/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T04:24:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T04:29:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241901","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977241901"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I'm amazed at what this fit into this movie without it feeling like they were missing to much.\nI don't know if it's because I'm a huge fan of the Infinity war comic or because I've been ecstatic to finally see the MCU fully flourish. \nHowever this is the best movie of the series so far.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10159514576450858/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T04:24:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T04:26:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"976856470","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976856470"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"One of the most thoroughly entertaining movies I’ve ever seen. Requires the context of the rest of the series, so those who haven’t seen many Marvel movies may be lost. Thanos is a great villain who is scarily logical.
