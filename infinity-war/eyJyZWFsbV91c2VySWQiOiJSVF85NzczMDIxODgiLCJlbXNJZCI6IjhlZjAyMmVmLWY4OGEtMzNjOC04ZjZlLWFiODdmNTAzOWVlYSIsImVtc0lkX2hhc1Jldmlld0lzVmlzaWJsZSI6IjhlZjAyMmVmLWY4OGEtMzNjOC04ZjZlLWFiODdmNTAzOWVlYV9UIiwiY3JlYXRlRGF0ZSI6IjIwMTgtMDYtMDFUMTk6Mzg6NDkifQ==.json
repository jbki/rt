Don't worry, no spoilers here...and that's why it's a tough film to review. Everything Marvel has brought us since they released Iron Man a decade ago has been building to this (well, this and Avengers 4). I tried to keep my excitement in check, but 10 minutes into the movie my fingernails were gone and the jimmy leg was in full effect. I went in expecting certain things to happen, but this movie dropped more surprises on me than I can count. In other words, Infinity War completely delivered! It's a terrifically executed setup for the Avengers last ride. One that's filled with humour, heart, action galore, and plenty of earth-shattering consequences thanks to the biggest bad in the MCU, Thanos. While it put a gigantic smile on my face seeing all these heroes teaming up, I'd argue that it's Thanos that makes the film something truly special. The best villains are always the ones who don't view themselves as evil, and Thanos is certainly that, believing what he's doing is truly in the best interest on the universe. Josh Brolin does a fantastic job bringing the character to life and deserves every bit of praise he gets. My main concern going into the movie was that it would feel a little over-stuffed with so many characters to juggle, and at times it does. It's essentially a bunch of small movies crammed into one big movie, and that big movie is only part one of two. Some characters are slightly underused, but everyone gets their moment to shine, and it'll be interesting to see how certain characters are utilized when the next film rolls out. At the end of Infinity War there's a lot at steak, a lot of questions, and a lot of consequences. It may sound a little messy, but it absolutely succeeds at what it sets out to accomplish...setting up the final chapter for many of the original Avengers.","displayName":"Ian B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/512590926/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-01T15:20:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-01T15:20:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"781960658","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ian B","accountLink":"/user/id/781960658"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"OK just not as many Marvel characters as i would have liked and not enough with Thor's mission","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-01T15:12:18.045Z","updateDate":"2018-06-01T15:12:18.045Z","user":{"userId":"260141747","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260141747"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was a cinematic masterpiece!","displayName":"Nico E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-01T12:55:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-01T12:55:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"977301809","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nico E","accountLink":"/user/id/977301809"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Can you say overrated?
