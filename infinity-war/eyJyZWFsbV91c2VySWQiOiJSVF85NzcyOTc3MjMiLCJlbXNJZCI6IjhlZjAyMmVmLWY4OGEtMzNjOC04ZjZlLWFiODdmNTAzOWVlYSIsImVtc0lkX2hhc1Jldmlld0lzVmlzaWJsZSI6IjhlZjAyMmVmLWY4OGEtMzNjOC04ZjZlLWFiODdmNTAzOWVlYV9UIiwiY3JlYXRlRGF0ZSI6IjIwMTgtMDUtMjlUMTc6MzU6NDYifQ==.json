Balancing as many characters, set pieces, and tonal shifts while doing so in a concise and undeniably entertaining manner is where Infinity War succeeds at its best. It truly is a testament to Marvel Studios that this film (albeit occasionally clunky in pacing) was put together so effectively. A must see for Marvel fans.

To have this many legendary characters on screen and to still give them each their due, while juggling the entire narrative competently, is impressive. Tons of very cool moments and a bold ending.

Jokes hit pretty good, great action&animations, intresting villain and Marvel was quite brave with that ending. onky thing bad was one gaping plot hole:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPOILER:\nThanos wants to kill half the people in the universe, because in his opinion the universe's finite ressources cannot substain the hole population (dumb malthusian^^). Therefore he needs to assemble all infinity stones in his gauntlett, which will grant him ultimate power and controll over all aspects of the universe, allowing him to instantly wipe out half the universe. if he can control every aspect of the universe, why the f*ck would he kill half the population instead of just doubling all the ressources?","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/944541392388014/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-29T15:06:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-29T15:13:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"976924915","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976924915"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"As a comic book movies fan I was anxiously waiting for this movie to come out and, true to form, I saw it twice on the first week. While it is very satisfying, none of it seems real now that we are aware of everything that's going on behind the scenes. There is no loss or victory, the whole movie seems like a huge exposition for the untitled sequel just like all those after credits scenes were an exposition for this. It's a MARVEL-ous formula that continues to bring in the big bucks but this really feels like a \" Part 1\" movie even if they dropped that from the title. The huge amount of characters and movies tied into this one create a perfect gift for the Marvel fans but casual movie goers might find themselves questioning who, when, how or why several times during the movie.","displayName":"Catalin M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-29T14:22:14.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-29T14:31:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"977297508","realm":"RT","displayName":"Catalin M","accountLink":"/user/id/977297508"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's not perfect but damn near.  It's hilarious and gut-wrenching.  The relationships that form between character that just met are heart-warming.  They have excellent chemistry, whether they're being smart asses to each other or having a heart to heart, it's good stuff. But no, it's not perfect.  There are flaws, but for me, they were easy to overlook and be FULLY entertained.","displayName":"kimberly c","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-29T13:30:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-29T13:34:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"965279872","realm":"RT","displayName":"kimberly c","accountLink":"/user/id/965279872"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Another typical super hero movie.

Really enjoyed Dr Strange, Iron Man, and Spidey, but found the 'Scared Hulk' to be disappointing.  It was gut wrenching watching Loki die so quickly and in such a worthless fashion.  Seeing ALL of the Guardians except Rocket dying was horrible, but from comic nerds I hear this is all nonsense and they all come back to life.  Infinity War is non stop action but you enjoy it and you don't notice the time going by.  Some better writing, like poor Star Lord's pathetic display, could have really up-notched this huge feature.  All in all though a very entertaining show.","displayName":"Gavin J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-29T11:40:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-29T11:43:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"977297310","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gavin J","accountLink":"/user/id/977297310"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Lots of twists and shocks but it was always supposed to be  two part movie so can't wait to see what they do with the next one.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1582662575121122/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-29T11:38:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-29T11:40:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"977132556","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977132556"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 29, 2018"}]}
