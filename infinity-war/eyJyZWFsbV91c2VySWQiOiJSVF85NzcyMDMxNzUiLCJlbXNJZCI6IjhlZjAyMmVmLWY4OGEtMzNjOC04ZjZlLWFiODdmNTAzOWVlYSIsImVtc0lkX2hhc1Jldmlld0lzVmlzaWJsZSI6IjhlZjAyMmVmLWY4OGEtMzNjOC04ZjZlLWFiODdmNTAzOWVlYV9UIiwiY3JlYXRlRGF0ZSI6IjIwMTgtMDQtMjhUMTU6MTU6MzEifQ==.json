One of the most enjoyable films to watch. I cannot believe Marvel took so many storylines and weave them together seamlessly. The movie was amazing and pretty easy to follow.

Don't look for in-depth character development here; this is a knock-down, drag-out fight, start to finish.  In short, MCU fans have been eagerly awaiting this movie for years and should enjoy it immensely, but curious non-fans would be completely lost, much as one would be if one were to skip most of the chapters of a book and start near its climax.  Excellent fare for its target audience.","displayName":"George D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10153772853537716/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T15:06:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T12:17:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"972649209","realm":"RT","displayName":"George D","accountLink":"/user/id/972649209"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
