No, before you ask I'm not being paid to say this. I literally just walked out of the theatere after seeing this with my dad, who I have been watching Marvel movies with my dad religiously ever since Iron Man one came  in 2008. Haven't missed one since. I can honestly say that it truly feels like a fitting and emotionally-fulfilling culmination of every piece of Marvel entertainment that I've seen leading up to this. If you are a fan of the comics, I do not think you will be disappointed, save for one aspect of Thanos' character they excluded, which I won't mention here. While not without its problems, like some noticeable pacing issues, the only big negative I have is that I feel like I have a headache after watching this. Perhaps it was not possible to make a film of this scale and grandeur an easy one to digest, as it certainly isn't. However I think the Russo brothers did the absolute best that they could given their monumental situation, and what they made  was, in spite of all of its faults, one word: SPECTACULAR. It will take me several repeat viewings, all of which I will be very enthused to attend, to fully grasp what it is I have just seen, how I feel about it, and what it will mean for the Marvel universe going forward. Truly awesome.","displayName":"Michael P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T19:02:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T19:20:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"905636727","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael P","accountLink":"/user/id/905636727"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Without a doubt the best Avenger’s movie. In the end, the long awaited Infinity War delivers a comedic, action packed, heartbreaking superhero film which lives only to please the sheer idea of why movies deserve two parts. This excellent film cannot be rejoiced for all the things it does right, but can be condemned only by the fans who love the characters they see on screen by the agony of knowing that this is not the end, and now after waiting 10 long years, being forced behind the filmmaking sheets once again until Part 2 arrives like a savior to appease our thirst for a conclusive, permanent finally to the universe’s most powerful threat. Well done Russo brothers, the stakes have now been raised even higher than before, and soon in Part 2 to unknown lengths. How they’ll satisfy their loyal fan base, it remains unknown, but we’ll be sure to expect the unexpected.

I have been following all the movies since Iron man, and I am not a big comic book reader, but before watching the movie I read the infinity gauntlet comic. This movie has a lot of elements from that comic. It all leads to this big enemy and the movie kept it fresh and interesting during the 2:30 hours. It leaves audiences craving for more. Thank you Russo brothers for this masterpiece.","displayName":"ruben t","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T19:00:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T19:05:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977240687","realm":"RT","displayName":"ruben t","accountLink":"/user/id/977240687"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"A truly heart breaking movie if you care anything about these characters you do not want to see this movie.

It has multiple crazy battles, screens packed full of superheroes, comedic moments, and a really bad ass bad guy. You can identify with Thanos and his reasoning for what he's doing, which makes it so weird having pity and compassion for the villain. The ending is one of the biggest emotional rollercoasters a movie has provided. I never thought I could feel that way towards a comic book movie but I have and it shows how great this movie is. I really need the next Avengers movie ASAP.","displayName":"Joseph K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T18:56:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T19:00:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"977240678","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph K","accountLink":"/user/id/977240678"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"}]}
