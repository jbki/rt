However they fix the mess made, you know they have to. Which makes things a little too obvious. \n\nMore story than Suicide Squad (another cliff noted)  but less than Black Panther their current best.","displayName":"Erica T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T00:46:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T01:38:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"975730527","realm":"RT","displayName":"Erica T","accountLink":"/user/id/975730527"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I can't believe how good this movie is... watched it twice and want to see it again.
