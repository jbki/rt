Great special effects, amazing action sequences and the movie manages to balance out its darker tone with a healthy dose of humour. All of which culminates in an ending that left me speechless. Even the post-credits scene leaves you like this. Josh Brolin's takeover of the MCU HAS BEGUN!!! No-one is safe.

Never before did we question the absoluteness of Thanos' evil nature, or dream he might see himself and his purpose as righteous. Infinity War is the story of the MCU from Thanos' point of view. We hear his argument, understand his purpose, feel his passion and pain, and resist empathizing with his repugnant conclusion. The world's highest grossing opening-weekend movie did not receive positive reviews from universalists who want to live in a world where righteousness is absolute, and solutions are black and white. Killing Thanos would be much easier than trying to find a more humane resolution that covers his concerns. The only problem is that killing him won't make his concerns go away. Thanos demonstrates their legitimacy, and proves he is willing to sacrifice as much as anyone else in making hard decisions to mitigate their effect.","displayName":"G Richard B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T07:15:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T07:15:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"905676017","realm":"RT","displayName":"G Richard B","accountLink":"/user/id/905676017"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Movie is incredible !!

The Russo Bros. Proved me wrong. This film is not only the greatest Superhero film Ive ever seen... its the best movie Ive ever seen. The story was compelling. The acting was amazing. The CGI was top notch. Kevin. F. and The Russo Bros. are everything  Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson WISHED they could be. And theyve done with Avengers Infinity War EVERYTHING that Rian Johnson exclaimed that he wanted to do with TLJ but failed miserably. Avengers Infinity War is a cinematic masterpiece. 5 Stars.","displayName":"Lance A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T07:04:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T07:11:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"976996337","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lance A","accountLink":"/user/id/976996337"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"GREAT action flick if you follow the Marvel movies (I pity the fool that watches this stand alone).  I love how all the characters tie together (example: Rocket and Buckey's arm or Thor's eye).  There is a LOT going on, and even at 2.5 hours, it still feels like not enough time.\nLike most ensemble movies, each character wasn't given enough time.  But the fact that there were the OTHER dozen Marvel movies makes up for that.  The original Avengers 1 felt much less developed as there were not as many backstories yes.\nAlso appreciated that the characters didn't make obvious dumb choices (looking at you 'Last Jedi') - even when Strange handed over the Time stone, I suspect he did it because he saw that was the only future where they win.\nMy only real gripe with the movie was the power of the gauntlet.  Once the Avengers get their hands on it, they can just undo everything that happened in this movie, and nothing that happened means anything.","displayName":"cork b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T07:02:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-14T18:03:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"977138468","realm":"RT","displayName":"cork b","accountLink":"/user/id/977138468"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"}]}
