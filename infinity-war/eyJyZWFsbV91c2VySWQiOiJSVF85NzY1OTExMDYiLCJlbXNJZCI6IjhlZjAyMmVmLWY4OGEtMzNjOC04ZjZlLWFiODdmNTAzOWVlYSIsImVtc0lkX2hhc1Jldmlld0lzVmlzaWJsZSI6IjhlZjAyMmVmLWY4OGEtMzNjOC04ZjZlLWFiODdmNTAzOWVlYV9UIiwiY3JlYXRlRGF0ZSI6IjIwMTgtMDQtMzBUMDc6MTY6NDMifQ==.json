If you expected the ending then good for you but the movie left people drained, pissed, sad, and shocked.  The action is almost non-stop so you end up drained by the time it is over.  And when it is over you just sort of sit there for a couple of minutes wondering if what you saw really happened on the screen.  Of course, then begins the what is next?  Marvel will sell out the first week of the next one, which will be something everyone is waiting for.","displayName":"Roger L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1533255495/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T07:04:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T07:06:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"843118034","realm":"RT","displayName":"Roger L","accountLink":"/user/id/843118034"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The movie is beautiful, going forward every major blockbuster will only dream of bringing in this many established characters to a universal threat.  The one-liners and comedy have become a staple to all Marvel films that assure audience members will want to return a second time. Thanos starts off with a bang, showing complete dominance over the heroes.  His early victory is a great way to show off the strength of a villain and establish doubt in the average viewer that gives credibility to Thanos.  \n\nThe first thirty mins of the movie feel like a mess.  It is a problem having too many main characters as it jumps around from Character group to character group.  The movie thrives as it focuses more on Thanos, it starts to build a villain you may not agree with but begin to understand.  Unfortunately, all the children of Thanos are not developed at all and virtually feel as pointless as a mindless minion.\n\nThis movie would have been improved on by focusing on developing Thanos and his children.  As Thanos and his children go about their evil deeds, then send in the heroes to stop them.  The heroes characters have already been established in their previous stories, but without additional context to the villains, the film's minor villains feel lost in the CGI. \n\nThe most exciting part of this movie is the speculation of how the new Marvel storylines tie into the ending.  The ending has fueled my excitement at the Ant-Man and Wasp, Captain Marvel, and the next Infinity War movies.","displayName":"Ian D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T07:01:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T09:43:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"907790476","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ian D","accountLink":"/user/id/907790476"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"}]}
