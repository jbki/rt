The dialog was great. The movie has many humorous parts. I felt the character's actions were true to their established selves. This film is basically part one of two so one of the tests to judge it by is how bad do you want to see the next one. I want to very badly, tomorrow if possible please. Saw it in IMAX 3D. It looked amazing. The running time wasn't an issue.  The film didn't seem long and I wasn't anxious for it to end.  I'm unsure how this film received 16% negative reviews from \"the pros.\" Maybe they just had their heads up their asses because this is one that is can't miss in the theater.  Keep in mind too that it is basically part one of a two part story to finish up in Avengers 4.  The breaking point is one that fits the story but I've heard too much criticism that doesn't take into account that the story isn't done. Infinity War was worth the wait.","displayName":"Sonny B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T15:41:09.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T05:51:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"910091015","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sonny B","accountLink":"/user/id/910091015"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"kind of pointless in my opinion. bad guy gets super powerful weapon but no back story to why or what's his motivation and the good guys just hand it over pieces to make it stronger everytime. I mean if you have the ability to change time why not use it to go back and help the avengers have a more coordinated plan instead of react from the hip the whole time. oh and lets protect vision by opening the gate to wakonda and letting every bad guy in and then charge towards them so he has even less time to be saved. just really poor plot points and typical run of the mill action. nothing new here.

My girlfriend slept well. Terrible ending.  Characters are poorly developed and Captain America is pretending to be GiJoe.  Unless you want to leave disappointed and need 2 hours of sleep stay away.

It can at times be a little overwhelming, with so many characters and what not, but that only helps on the perception of the plot, since there has been created a lot of ''superheroes'' on the cinematic screen. I think this is a very good movie, with a bunch of nerdy details, but can also be enjoyed as a ''non-marvel-fan'' :)","displayName":"Magnus A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T14:58:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T15:09:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"977255541","realm":"RT","displayName":"Magnus A","accountLink":"/user/id/977255541"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"one of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen worth watching more than once and definitely will be purchasing when it comes out","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T14:53:54.781Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T14:53:54.781Z","user":{"userId":"260126584","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260126584"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"SPOILER ALERT!!!
