There is no other franchise that has been able to be this consistently entertaining in the history of cinema. I don't know how much longer they can keep it up but Infinity War was an epic culmination of 10 years of work. Some of the characters may have been a bit underutilized but that's understandable considering the amount of people in the movie. Thanos alone was worth the watch. By far he is the best villain the MCU has produced, heck one of his henchmen in The Black Order was so annoyingly good at his job I wasn't sure if they'd be able to beat him let alone Thanos. I'm not sure how anyone can not like this movie. I may be a bit biased though, I have been reading comics for a very long time. Being a comic book and a movie lover the MCU is like a dream come true for me. I'm definitely going to see this again a couple more times. Now if we can just get WB and DC to get there act together.","displayName":"Richard R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T22:42:14.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T22:58:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"913804900","realm":"RT","displayName":"Richard R","accountLink":"/user/id/913804900"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with how this movie turned out.

I literally made an account specifically to give this movie as few stars as possible. Imagine someone has given you a used paper coffee cup for your birthday. That's what this movie is: empty, boring, offensive. Covered in stains and someone else's germs. I don't want this. There is no use for this. No gift would have been preferable. \n\nWhat's worse--and in all seriousness, with metaphors aside--there were actual real live children sobbing at what they saw on the screen in my theater.  The creators of this movie need to take a big step back and think about who they're making these movies for.","displayName":"Katie F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T22:25:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T16:17:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249982","realm":"RT","displayName":"Katie F","accountLink":"/user/id/977249982"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Saw Infinity War today, i was excited to see it because not even a single one of the Marvel movies let me down (except maybe Spiderman 2 & 3).\nWhat a fraud, the movie does not live up to the hype, the entire movie i wanted to bolt out of the cinema and ask for my money back, every single joke is crass or has not a single drop of humor in it, in the entire movie only three scenes were worth even watching, the last scene the first scene, and the subsequent one, in that order of quality. And the action was too fast paced and not well choreographed. \nThe movie paces itself badly by alternating between too dull and long conversations and many action scenes that last only a few seconds because of the time constrains from having too many characters on it.\nThe only good thing that this movie does is open up the scene for the second infinity war movie. I would not recommend it by far.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/622915651395471/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T22:24:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T22:37:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249980","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977249980"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"}]}
