Almost none of the characters were convincing as per previous films which built them up and gave us a connection with each one. There was simply too much going on to be able to have any emotional engagement with the characters.\n\nPoints are for the special effects alone. The story, delivery and involvement were lacking. I hope the next one justifies the existence of this one.","displayName":"Marshall R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1698912857078256/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T00:36:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T00:40:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"976466927","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marshall R","accountLink":"/user/id/976466927"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"A 5 Star movie ruined by black sub human monkey animal actors.
