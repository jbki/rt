While there are so many superheroes stuffed into one movie I felt as though everyone got one scene where they shined. Thanos was the most menacing villain of the MCU.

Loved how this movie focused a lot on the villian, Thanos. Finally the villian wins. Marvel went all out with this one. IMAX 3D was stunning. Best 3D visuals I've seen.
