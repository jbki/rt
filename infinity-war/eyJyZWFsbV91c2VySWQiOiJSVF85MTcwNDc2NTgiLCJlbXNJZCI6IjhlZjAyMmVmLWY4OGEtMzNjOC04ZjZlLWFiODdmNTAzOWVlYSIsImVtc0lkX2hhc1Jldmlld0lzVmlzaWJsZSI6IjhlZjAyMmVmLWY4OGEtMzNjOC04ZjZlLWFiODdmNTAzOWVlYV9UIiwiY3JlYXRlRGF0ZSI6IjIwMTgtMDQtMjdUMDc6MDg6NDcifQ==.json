They really did it.\n\nThis movie is both completely unexpected and everything I could have hoped for. It truly stands as a culmination of the past 10 years and 18 films. There is literally nothing I would change, from the music to the score to the story to, yes, even the ending. This movie isn't afraid to pull any punches, and I love it for that.\n\nOnly time will tell the full impact of everything we just saw, but for now, I can tell you that Avengers - Infinity War lives up to its hype and potential and is _the_ defining cinematic experience of this generation.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1541934955885789/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T06:58:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T07:03:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"976942906","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976942906"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
