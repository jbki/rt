I don't read comics so i went in just knowing the characters from previous films.

I was disappointed. Maybe its because i am a fan of the original comics and storylines and i know that scarlet witch is supposed to be essentially the most powerful being on earth and the Incredible Hulk as well..... This movie crippled characters in such ways it was painful to watch. The monologuing from Thanos i didnt fall asleep on although i did hear snores from others in the theater- the movie is very long. I dont want to say too much about the film so ill just say this: Go into the movie expecting a lot of action and suspense and a dash of comedy. Do not go into this film expecting accuracy or hope. Its a bit of a dream crusher. RIP to the fallen characters.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T03:39:14.868Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T03:39:14.868Z","user":{"userId":"561452021","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/561452021"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
