I'm talking some serious climax action start to finish. The story played out perfectly in line with previous movies and brought back characters that you forgot even existed. If I had the option of clapping down Megan Fox or watching this movie a second time, I'd shoot Meg and choose the movie. We've got a true piece of artwork in a film here. Might as well cancel the Oscars cause this is winning every award.","displayName":"Dean C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T07:56:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T08:02:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"977260450","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dean C","accountLink":"/user/id/977260450"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It doesn't leave you with much breathing room, but it will leave you with a feeling you just watched a over two hour funny, action packed, and heartbreaking climax to a decade long movie.","displayName":"Todd A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T07:54:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T07:54:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"901315139","realm":"RT","displayName":"Todd A","accountLink":"/user/id/901315139"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Not only does it pay off ten year's worth of films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it leaves us wanting more; it's the only Marvel movie I've watched where everyone stayed in the cinema until the end of the credits. It's not a conventional movie, mainly a parade of our favourite superheroes - all of whom get their day in the sun - and they're up against the biggest odds they've faced yet. Amazingly, amongst all this epic action we get moments of introspection, and in Thanos a very interesting villain. The jaw dropping ending won't fool you into thinking this is the end, but will make you wonder just how it isn't.","displayName":"Dave G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T07:37:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T13:10:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"977009415","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dave G","accountLink":"/user/id/977009415"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Really great but its dissapointing that some of my favorite heroes died.","displayName":"Nakama C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T07:37:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T07:38:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"977260425","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nakama C","accountLink":"/user/id/977260425"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Cgi does not make a film.
