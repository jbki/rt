This is what I jave been waiting for since the mid-credit scene of Avengers and it was worth the wait. Keep in mind all the series and too many characters is no issue. The plot is great, action stupendous, and cgi perfect, except for one shot. Acting was good as always every character held true to their abilities. Thanos voiced by Josh Brolin is quite possibly the greatest villain of all time, aside from Darth Vader of course, his emotions and pure malice makes him something truly evil. No real flaws for me, cannot wait for the future. 4.5/5","displayName":"Anthony P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/286418548380410/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T21:54:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T21:59:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"975113771","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anthony P","accountLink":"/user/id/975113771"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Marvel does a fantastic job in the portrayal of Thanos as the villain. He is probably one of the best and most feared villain I have ever seen. He is not just some whimsical villain we see in almost every other movie. He truly believes that his goal is the only way for the survival of the universe. Marvel did so incredible with his character, viewers even somewhat understand his intentions and feel empathetic toward him at times.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1428319680592131/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T21:53:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T21:59:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"976564421","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976564421"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wonderful story .. this is different than everyone sometimes hero will lose or win","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1834248536647308/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T21:52:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-18T12:40:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"977110280","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977110280"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"It was good, but it was all over the place.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T21:50:43.957Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T01:48:47.253Z","user":{"userId":"260083784","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260083784"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best movie ever !","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2141728809449032/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T21:50:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T21:51:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241092","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977241092"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Intense.
