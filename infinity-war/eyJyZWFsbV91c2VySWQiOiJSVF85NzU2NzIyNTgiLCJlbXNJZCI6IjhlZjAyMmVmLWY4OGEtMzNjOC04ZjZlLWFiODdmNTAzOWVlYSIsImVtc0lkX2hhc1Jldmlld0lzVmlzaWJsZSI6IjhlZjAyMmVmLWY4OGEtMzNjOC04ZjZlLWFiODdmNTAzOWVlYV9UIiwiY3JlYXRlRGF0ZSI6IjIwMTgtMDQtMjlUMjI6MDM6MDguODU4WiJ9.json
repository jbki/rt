The action is on point, the emotion is on point, no unnecessary humor (humor is also on point). The movie promises and it delivers. You will not be disappointed.

I came in expecting no character development due to having to juggle 25 to 34 heroes, but I was pleasantly surprised that this movie seemed to move these characters forward. Story was average, but still kept me entertained, and the pacing was done right, unlike many of these films. The ending is also one of the best endings I've seen for a film, as it leaves you questioning where these characters  will go from here","displayName":"Eamon H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T22:02:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T22:10:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"974945844","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eamon H","accountLink":"/user/id/974945844"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My new favorite movie of all time","displayName":"Jordan C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T21:57:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T21:57:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"915985605","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jordan C","accountLink":"/user/id/915985605"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing movie!!!! 4DX best I’ve seen a movie in so far ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T21:57:19.509Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T21:57:19.509Z","user":{"userId":"794502280","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/794502280"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"This movie is not your standard Marvel movie in many ways. It  does contain some of the key elements of a Marvel movie, such as pop culture references and quick one-liners that we've come to expect out of characters such as Spider-man and Peter Quill, however, due to its crossover nature, infinity war lacks some of the intimacy to the character that the watcher usually receives with an MCU film. Likewise, in this nature, instead of watching a full, thought-out movie plotline, watchers experience more of a show plotline. Especially a show that makes episodes at the standard 22-minute length. Instead of watching a movie, viewers are watching many semi-related plotlines come together to a season finale that many viewers did not want to receive in the first place. The movie lacks the overall feel that we have come to expect from an MCU film. Due to this, I will not be giving this film praise like I do with many other Marvel films, and many others shouldn't either if we want a truly good movie from Marvel Studios. We cannot let them just get away with this one letting them receive high media praise like they normally receive. We have to show Marvel that they have to prove to us that they can make good movies every time they release a movie. This can be no different.","displayName":"Aaron%20 M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T21:56:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T22:10:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249945","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aaron%20 M","accountLink":"/user/id/977249945"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Epic! I don’t know what these people criticizing it are on but I have seen every marvel movie and this one was great! I mean of course not everyone could get screen time but what do you expect? It’s a 2.5 hr movie not a 4 hour movie (I wish it was) but they did a great job with it! Just for perspective, I don’t like it just bc it’s marvel as I didn’t care for a couple of them (they know who they are) but overall this was a huge success!!!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T21:56:03.470Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T13:21:42.527Z","user":{"userId":"260124596","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260124596"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A spectacle of a film on a large scale.
