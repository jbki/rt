Good use of limited screen time for the massive cast and well paced. The merging cinematic bubbles creates a strange hybrid of witty humor and despair. But Thanos's motive felt rather contrived and misguided; how exactly does killing half of all life in the galaxy prevent heat death? Marvel's attempt at creating an anti-hero was rather poor.","displayName":"Kevin Z","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-18T08:20:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-18T08:34:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"977260399","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kevin Z","accountLink":"/user/id/977260399"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Is a comedy that abruptly becomes a tragedy, the genocidal villain is the protagonist, the movie allows him to win, reduces the struggles of our heroes to nothing, will create a generation of nihilists.","displayName":"Blaise F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-18T08:19:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-18T08:23:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"915108553","realm":"RT","displayName":"Blaise F","accountLink":"/user/id/915108553"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 18, 2018"}]}
