I was actually afraid that it would be more like Age of Ultron and Civil WAr, which I didn't favor much. The acting was amazing for a superhero film. JOsh Brolin's rendition of Thanos was nothing short of Oscar-worthy. I was really amazed how his character came through all of that CG animation. Phenomenal. One bone to pick....It really would've been better without Spider-Man. The character was pretty annoying, and the humorous element he added to the film really wasn't all that humorous. I do have an issue with part of the story line that didn't make much sense, but...illogical actions often become the foundation for many, many stories.","displayName":"Regina P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-24T20:14:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-24T20:21:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"969064132","realm":"RT","displayName":"Regina P","accountLink":"/user/id/969064132"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"lots of fun, lots of action, tons of characters. it's a miracle that the directors and writers could even manage this many characters in one movie.","displayName":"Orison F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-24T19:33:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-24T19:36:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"976593661","realm":"RT","displayName":"Orison F","accountLink":"/user/id/976593661"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"O melhor filme de super her√≥i de todos !!!!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1608680552563754/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-24T19:26:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-24T19:27:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"977287171","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977287171"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome all around!
