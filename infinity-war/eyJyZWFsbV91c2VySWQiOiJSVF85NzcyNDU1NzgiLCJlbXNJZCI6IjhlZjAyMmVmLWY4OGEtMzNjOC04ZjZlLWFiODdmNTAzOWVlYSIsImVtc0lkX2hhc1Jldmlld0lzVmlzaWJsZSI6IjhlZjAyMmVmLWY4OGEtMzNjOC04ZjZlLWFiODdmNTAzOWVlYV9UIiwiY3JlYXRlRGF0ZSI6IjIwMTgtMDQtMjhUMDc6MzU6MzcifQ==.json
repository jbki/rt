MANY explosions rocked the theater both emotionally and with amazing special effects. So many of my favorite characters had hilarious meetings. I laughed; I cried; I was terrified; I cheered! The emotions were profound. I have never seen a more well acted CGI than the evil villain Thanos.  I LOVEc this movie!! GO THOR! I love you Gamorah. Rocket you are the cutest little rabbit I've ever seen and so feisty!!

They might have been \"Secret Wars\".  I remember what it was like to read an epic story involving epic superheroes locked in a drama of mythological proportions.  Avengers: Infinity War is the realization of that reading experience.  It hits just that right balance of drama and comedy, and the amazing special effects don't overshadow the characters.  It's all there, and it's perfection.","displayName":"Mark S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/612018303/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T07:30:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-19T09:43:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"799073071","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark S","accountLink":"/user/id/799073071"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Overall was a great film, but there are several aspects that were not addressed and felt a bit too cut up and pasted together.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10156628602549768/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T07:30:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T07:33:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245563","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977245563"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Really good and non-stop action","displayName":"Steven H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T07:29:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T07:29:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"953059293","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steven H","accountLink":"/user/id/953059293"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"This film is a mess, confusing and complicated.
