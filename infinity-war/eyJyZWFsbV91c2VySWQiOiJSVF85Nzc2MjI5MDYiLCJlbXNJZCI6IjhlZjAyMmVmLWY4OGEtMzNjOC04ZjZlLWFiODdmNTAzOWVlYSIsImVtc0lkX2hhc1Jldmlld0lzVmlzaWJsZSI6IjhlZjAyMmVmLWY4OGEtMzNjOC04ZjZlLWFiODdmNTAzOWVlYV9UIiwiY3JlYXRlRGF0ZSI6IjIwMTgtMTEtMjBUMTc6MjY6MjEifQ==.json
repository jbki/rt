It had me jumping up and cheering throughout the whole film.  This next little bit is a spoiler, but before the movie started, I yelled out black panther dies! Because I didn't think it would happen, and then it did happen, so expect the unexpected.  Quills line: \"oh man\" is exactly how I felt throughout the whole movie.

I really don't understand the appeal of these films. I guess they are good comic book movies if all you want is the depth and substance of C grade comic book. All the jokey banter, two dimensional characters, over the top action sequences simplistic villains, poor CGI and formula writing is great if you're 13 or younger, but these aren't the films to watch if you want any real depth or quality story.","displayName":"Mark W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-11-18T15:21:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-11-18T15:26:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"977619054","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark W","accountLink":"/user/id/977619054"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Very well made, easily one of the best MCU movies. The action is amazing, the characters are great and the plot is very well structured. But the best thing with this movie to me is Thanos. There is so much depth to his character.
