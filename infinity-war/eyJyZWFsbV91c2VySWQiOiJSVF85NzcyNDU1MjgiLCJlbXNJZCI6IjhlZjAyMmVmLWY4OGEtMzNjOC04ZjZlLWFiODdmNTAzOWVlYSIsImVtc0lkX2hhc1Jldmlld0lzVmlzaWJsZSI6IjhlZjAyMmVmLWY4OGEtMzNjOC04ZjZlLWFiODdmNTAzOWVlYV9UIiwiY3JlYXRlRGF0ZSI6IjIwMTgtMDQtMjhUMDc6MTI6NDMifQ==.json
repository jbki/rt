The plot was over crowded so it was realitivly hard to get invested. The deaths were so frequent and meaningless because of sequels that they did not hit home at all, most of them had me rolling my eyes saying \"well that's not going to stick\". I understand this is part 1 but with part 2 so far out this movie needs to stand on its own, and in my opinion it doesn't. \n\nA big part of the reason I go to superhero movies is the happy ending. I love it when the good guy wins despite the deck being stacked against him, however lately there seems to be this push to make hero movies darker and more hopeless. That is not the hero movie I want to see. This movie seemed to be a gut punch of tragedy for tragedies sake. \n\nI love the MCU and this was disappointing for me. Hopefully the next movie makes me love it again.","displayName":"Kelsee C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1215417433/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T07:06:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T07:21:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"832346728","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kelsee C","accountLink":"/user/id/832346728"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Absolutely fantastic! 10 years later and I'm blown away by the amount of energy they crammed into 2 hours and 30 some odd min!
