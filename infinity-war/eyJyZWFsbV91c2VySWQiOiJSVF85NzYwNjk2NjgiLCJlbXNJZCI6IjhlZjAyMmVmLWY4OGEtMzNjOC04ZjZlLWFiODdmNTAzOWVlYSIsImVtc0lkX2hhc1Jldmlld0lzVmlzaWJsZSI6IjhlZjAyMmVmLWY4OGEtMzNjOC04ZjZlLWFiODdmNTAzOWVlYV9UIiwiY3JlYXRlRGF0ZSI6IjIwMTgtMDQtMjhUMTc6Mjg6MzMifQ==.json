Giving this movie a lower score then black panther shows true Hollywood bias. Just like real life..Its about everyone working together to stop great evil.

Totally lived up to the hype of 10 years in the making. Can't say much without spoiling the movie but I'll say it was amazing. Tense action, humor, suspense, and drama all in one movie. The MCU really out did themselves and they deserve high praise for their work. Thank you for providing an experience I'll never forget when I watched it during Thursday previews.","displayName":"Ozzie L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T17:23:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T17:32:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246854","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ozzie L","accountLink":"/user/id/977246854"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"If you're a casual watcher of \"superhero\" movies you may enjoy this. If you're a fan of the MCU like I used to be before I watched Avengers: Infinity War, I suggest you skip this. I wish I could get the last three hours of my life back.

I didn’t expect this movie to be so emotionally gripping. These aren’t just random action scenes sown together, it’s a series of scenes of characters protecting what they hold dear. It’s one of the most entertaining 2 hours you can spend watching a film. It isn’t just another superhero film, it’s beyond that. The ending to this movie has definitely left an impact on me.

The culmination of ten years of cinematic storytelling, that manages to keep the soul of what has come before it while simultaneously bringing something wholly new to the table. Claimed by many as a 'mish mash of several movies in one', this feeling evokes nausea for casual moviegoers yet giddiness and a sense of wonder for avid comic book readers.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000215003976/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T17:19:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T17:23:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246849","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977246849"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
