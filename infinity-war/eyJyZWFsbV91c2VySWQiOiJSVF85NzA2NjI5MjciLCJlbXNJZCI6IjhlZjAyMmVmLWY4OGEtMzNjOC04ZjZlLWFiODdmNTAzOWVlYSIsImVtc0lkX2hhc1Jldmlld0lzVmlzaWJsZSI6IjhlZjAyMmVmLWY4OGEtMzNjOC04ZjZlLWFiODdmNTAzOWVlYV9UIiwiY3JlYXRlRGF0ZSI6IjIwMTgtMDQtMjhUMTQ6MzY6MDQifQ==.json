The crowd goes wild!! - Definitely my all-time favorite MCU movie. I can say with great certainty that I will be watching the movie for the 15th time over the weekend. Combining the big names who have made the Marvel Cinematic Universe the juggernaut it's become in the past decade, the Russo brothers have once more delivered the thrills, comedy, and drama of a massive superhero film. The visuals are absolutely OUTSTANDING. Shout out to a global team of 2D, 3D artists & VFx studios who had a hand in the movie's success. Definitely part of the reason I signed up for Disney+ on day-1.","displayName":"Maarib A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/616245133/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T14:27:01.000Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T15:22:28.860Z","user":{"userId":"789025274","realm":"RT","displayName":"Maarib A","accountLink":"/user/id/789025274"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"La mejor de Avengers (no de marvel, pq la mejor es X-Men Days of future past). Genial el  Thanos. Buena acción y entretenida para lo larga. Sorprendente como ensamblan tanto personajes en diferentes planetas y situaciones sin verse absurdo (parece starwars por momentos). Lo Malo el final, a lo fácil matar a lo bestia (parece q lo hacen para ahorrar en salarios de actores), y va ser pésimo y estúpido si los reviven a todos y fingen que nunca paso nada, tipo LOST y Dragon Ball. Todavía voy  a ver q Thanos se vuelva bueno.","displayName":"Belmar M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T14:26:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T14:38:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"921462123","realm":"RT","displayName":"Belmar M","accountLink":"/user/id/921462123"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The beginning of the culmination of 10 years of the ONLY successful Cinematic Universe that brought together more than 60 well known characters from an array of vast genres...And they did it right!\n\nThere were a very few shortcuts taken, and  some tropes were glaring, but these criticisms are a drop in the Bucket compared to the sheer awesome spectacle that the rest of the movie was. No character in this vast array acts out of character.\n\nThis is how big budget spectacles should be made. It should give an impression that the creative side was forefront to the corporate side of making movies, which is where all the other failed CUs falter.\n\nSaw it once, will definitely go see it again...And again...","displayName":"L B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T14:26:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T14:36:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"919654492","realm":"RT","displayName":"L B","accountLink":"/user/id/919654492"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What a depressing but amazing movie.

This is an amazing take on the Infinity Gauntlet / Infinity Wars books.  While I can see people not quite getting this, or liking this movie. I believe that those not enjoying the experience are not the true comic fans and only know / understand the MCU for what they see on film.  \n\nThis had great tie ins from the original source material.  Building toward that finger snap and ending the movie was pretty much my expectation all along. \n\nMy one criticism would be that the deaths in this movie don't feel as painful as perhaps they should.  That is also likely because there is SO much death in this movie in general.   At the same time there probably won't be any characters completely dead by the time the next Avengers film concludes as I fully expect this time line to be erased as it is in the Infinity Gauntlet books.","displayName":"Jay D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100005593115326/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T14:23:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T14:42:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"959195861","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jay D","accountLink":"/user/id/959195861"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A Grand Entertainment!!
