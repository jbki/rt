Am I talking about the villain or the story choices made? A serious Marvel film that did much of what Civil \"Disagreement\" failed to follow through with. Truly, Thanos as a \"villain\" is far more interesting and complex than any others have been in these films. It's the perfect follow up to Thor: Ragnarok.","displayName":"Russell L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/689911265/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T19:25:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T19:28:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"804912618","realm":"RT","displayName":"Russell L","accountLink":"/user/id/804912618"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best movie-going experience I had in about ten years.

Although the film struggles with some of the screentime for certain characters, the scale of effort by the Russo Brothers is seen throughout the Movie. The movie is definitely one that anyone who loves movies should see, and to me has lived up to the immense hype that embodied it.","displayName":"That F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T19:04:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T19:10:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"977254438","realm":"RT","displayName":"That F","accountLink":"/user/id/977254438"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":" Best MCU Film ever made hopefully Part 2 will conclude such a great story properly ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T19:02:56.622Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T19:02:56.622Z","user":{"userId":"260050280","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260050280"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"El gran final de la película se arruina un poco por la incesante campaña mediática de Marvel (que en si misma, es un spoiler) y le roba algo de significado.","displayName":"Mario G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/669396704/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T18:57:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T01:56:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"889169643","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mario G","accountLink":"/user/id/889169643"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is an amazing movie!
