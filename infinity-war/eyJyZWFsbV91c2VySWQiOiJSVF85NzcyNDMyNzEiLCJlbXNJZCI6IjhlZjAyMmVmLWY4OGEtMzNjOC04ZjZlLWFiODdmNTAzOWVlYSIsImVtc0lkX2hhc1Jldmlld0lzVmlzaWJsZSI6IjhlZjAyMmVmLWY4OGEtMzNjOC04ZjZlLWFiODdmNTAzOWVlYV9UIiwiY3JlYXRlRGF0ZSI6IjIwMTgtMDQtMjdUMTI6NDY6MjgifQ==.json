Such an excellent balance of screen time for each character. The dynamics of each team up worked really well especially given that a good portion of the film follows characters from wildly different aspects of this universe working together.  Brolin's performance as Thanos was excellent. Be patient with his character because by the end of the film, his character is very well developed. He is a very complex antagonist who's convictions, more than his titanic powers, make him rather terrifying.  Furthermore, even if you have some knowledge of the comicbook arcs this film is based on and therefore have a general idea of how it might end, you will still be surprised. A few great twists and interesting choice that the Russo's made have this movie feeling like the freshest, most exciting marvel film yet.  Don't pay attention to the critics saying the film missed its mark. They're saying that there are too many characters and that there's no real ending. To then I say, what did you expect? If you've been following the development of this universe for the last ten years, keeping in mind that Avengers 4 (slated for release of May 2019) is essentially a direct sequel to Infiniy War, then you'll find that this movie is exactly what it needed to be. Real stakes, dire consequences, and a rich emotional toll taken by the end of the film. Great quips and comedy in there per usual as well, but not over bearing like Age of Ultron, GotG Vol. 2, or Ragnarok (which was intentionally a comedy). To summarize, the movie is fantastic and every audience member, whether old or new, into the comics or not, will enjoy this movie. \n\nP.S. Stay tuned for the post credits scene at the end! It topped off the end of the film I a great way!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/653630054684207/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T12:39:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T12:54:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243254","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977243254"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
