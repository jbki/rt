Worth the money. This movie could have had alot of problems coming together with the many back stories and the coverage of many heroes/villains in battle sequences. I think it was smart to place more focus on the villainy than in previous Marvel films. The plot and character changes from the comics I feel were necessary to bring cohesion to a movie.  The comics have so many timelines and characters that have already been established over many years that they would had to release more than 20 Marvel movies before production of infinity war could have been possible. This movie was entertaining from start to finish. It had humor, self sacrifice, good portrayal of friendship, heroism  and villainy. Even though it is the first of a series it provided a good balance of contentment for this film and bearable anticipation for the next one.","displayName":"Average%20 J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-16T15:13:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-16T15:36:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"977322194","realm":"RT","displayName":"Average%20 J","accountLink":"/user/id/977322194"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"loved it, best MCU film to date.","displayName":"Ian H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-16T13:38:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-16T13:39:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"977322152","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ian H","accountLink":"/user/id/977322152"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"More like a prologue to the future Avengers 4, Avengers: Infinity War shows a wide cast of superheroes banding together to save the universe from the evil Thanos. The movie felt a little all over the place, with so much going on (but then again I have not seen all the movies leading up to this point). Plenty of action and humor. The movie does a good job at explaining Thanos' motivations and reuniting the Avengers for a common goal.
