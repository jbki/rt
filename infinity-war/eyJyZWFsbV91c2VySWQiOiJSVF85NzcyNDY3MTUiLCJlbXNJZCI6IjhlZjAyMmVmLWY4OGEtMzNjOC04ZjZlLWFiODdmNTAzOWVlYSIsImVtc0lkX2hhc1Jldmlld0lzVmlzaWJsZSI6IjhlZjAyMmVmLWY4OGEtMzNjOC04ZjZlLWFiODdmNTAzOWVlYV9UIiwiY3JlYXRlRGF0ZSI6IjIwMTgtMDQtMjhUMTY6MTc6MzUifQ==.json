What Disney/ Marvel have created something very special over the last decade - a true universe of characters we care about, stand behind and identify with. Then they decided to put them into one film - somehow managing to give each one of them room to breathe, create and change. The Russo brothers, who are responsible for the best of the MCU, pull off this impossible juggling act with deft hand as if they were made to make this picture. In scope this movie is incredible. In execution this movie is incredible. In character development this movie is incredible and still with all that, it is the writing that truly steals show. It’s a wonderpus blend of emotion and levity that both honors the universe built while still feeling completely fresh. Infinity war is better then the sum of its parts. It stands on the shoulders of some of the greatest comic book films of all time and makes them all better through its existence. It’s a cinematic feat that has here to fore never been imagined let alone accomplished.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T16:16:27.862Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T16:16:27.862Z","user":{"userId":"829636627","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/829636627"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"If you don’t like this movie I don’t know what to tell you. I was a huge fan of the Infinity Gauntlet comic book as a kid, this movie changes a lot but I think the changes tell a different but equally as a good story. In fact the differences kept me guessing even though the main points stayed the same. They did Thanos Justice which is the high point of this movie.

It was very long. They did a great job with special effects. But they had to do too much explaining at various points of the movie due to the different arcs not having been laid out in the previous movies. That made this long movie seem even longer. It wasn't a good movie. It wasn't even a good superhero movie. Unless you were completely geeked up over seeing so many characters interact for the first time in this universe I can really nderstand the high marks this movie is receiving. I saw Black Panther 4 times and Wonder Woman 5 times. I probably won't even see this a second time.","displayName":"Joseph V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T16:15:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T16:21:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246708","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph V","accountLink":"/user/id/977246708"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best Marvel movie to date, by a fair margin (and that's saying something!).  This movie captured the real spirit of the epic crossover events of the 80s and 90s.  Nearly flawless execution.  And how great was it to see Spider-man coming into his own?  Just the right amount of Spidey for this movie!!
