Mainly the lack of comprehension towards the ending. The movie had great emotion. It made me laugh and it made me longing for the next part to see how things are resolved. For those that think this is the end then you really should see the movie again and pay attention to what Doctor Strange says about seeing the future. There is a reason why he saves Tony after telling him that he wouldn't. It's very intentional writing. I never felt this movie dragged on and could have easily continued watching these characters. As for the professional critics well it's no surprise that once again their rating is not reflecting the audience rating and it can't just be about the enjoyment of the movie itself. They really need to get back in touch with reality because it only gives them bad images. The movie isn't perfect but it is a very good time that leaves you wanting more.","displayName":"Kevin C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/804320248/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T11:41:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T11:52:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"805114095","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kevin C","accountLink":"/user/id/805114095"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Funny, but extremely plot hole ridden.
