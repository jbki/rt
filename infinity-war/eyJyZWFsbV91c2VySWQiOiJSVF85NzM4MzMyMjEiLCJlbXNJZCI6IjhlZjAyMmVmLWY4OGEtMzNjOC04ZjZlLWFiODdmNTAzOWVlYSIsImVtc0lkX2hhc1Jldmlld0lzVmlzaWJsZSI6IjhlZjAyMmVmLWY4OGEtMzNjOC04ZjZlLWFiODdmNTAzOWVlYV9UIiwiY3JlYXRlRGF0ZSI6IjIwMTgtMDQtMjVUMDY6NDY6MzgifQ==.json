Two things that the MCU has been missing for a while now.\nI can't really say more in depth other than good acting, good pacing, good writing and really just well done at getting to this point over a ten year stretch. Hand on heart, I didn't think they could pull it off but they did.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10155235648702064/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T06:44:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-25T06:51:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977237519","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977237519"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I loved every minute of this I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie my only real griped is we never got to learn more about the black order but other than that this movie was great","displayName":"Nick M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T06:43:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T05:41:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"919253164","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nick M","accountLink":"/user/id/919253164"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is so fucking awesome","displayName":"Alex E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T06:41:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T07:17:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"977237512","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex E","accountLink":"/user/id/977237512"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Quite a feat to string all the Marvel plots together into a thrilling and emotional whole!","displayName":"Adrian S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/687878571/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T06:40:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T19:51:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"792478225","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adrian S","accountLink":"/user/id/792478225"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A comic lovers dream come true","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T06:39:49.295Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T07:33:57.014Z","user":{"userId":"976516256","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976516256"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A very entertaining and jam packed Avengers Movie, that needs to run long in order to fit in the abundance of MCU characters all coming together, but doesn't feel overly long as everyone is busy doing something to bring the movie together.
