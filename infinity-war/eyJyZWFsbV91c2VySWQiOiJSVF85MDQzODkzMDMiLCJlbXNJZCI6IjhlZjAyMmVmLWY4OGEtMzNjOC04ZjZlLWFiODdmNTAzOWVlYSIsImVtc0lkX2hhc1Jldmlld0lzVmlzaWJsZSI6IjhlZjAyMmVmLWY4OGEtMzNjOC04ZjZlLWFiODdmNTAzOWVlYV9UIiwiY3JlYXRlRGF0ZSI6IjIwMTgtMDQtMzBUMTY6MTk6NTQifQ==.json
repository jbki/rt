I've cried harder watching a horror movie. It wasn't as moving as it should have been considering everything going on. Also I know 2 years has happened since Civil War but how did Pepper and Tony get back together AND be engaged. And yes I am an avid fan of Marvel movies I've liked everything except Hulk movie and that Thor Raganok (that too was TOO goofy and did not pull any emotion from me)","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10150619561254948/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T16:10:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T16:16:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"976929576","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976929576"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Super great movie.
