Saw it twice already.  Great mix of humor, action, and character drama.  Josh Brolin as Thanos was exceptional.

Marvel Studios does a really good job incorporating all of the characters and blending them into the story. There is a lot of action but it does not become overly saturated  to the point where you do not know who is who. There are a lot of twists and unexpected surprises. I liken it to the Empire Strikes Back, which in my opinion, is the best movie in the Star Wars franchise. It has a very open ending in which the fate of the good guys is unclear. There is a little ray of hope for the next movie. Unlike the Star Wars 9, I am looking forward to Infinity War 2.","displayName":"Jon Y","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T09:03:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T13:59:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"977236382","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jon Y","accountLink":"/user/id/977236382"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wow!
