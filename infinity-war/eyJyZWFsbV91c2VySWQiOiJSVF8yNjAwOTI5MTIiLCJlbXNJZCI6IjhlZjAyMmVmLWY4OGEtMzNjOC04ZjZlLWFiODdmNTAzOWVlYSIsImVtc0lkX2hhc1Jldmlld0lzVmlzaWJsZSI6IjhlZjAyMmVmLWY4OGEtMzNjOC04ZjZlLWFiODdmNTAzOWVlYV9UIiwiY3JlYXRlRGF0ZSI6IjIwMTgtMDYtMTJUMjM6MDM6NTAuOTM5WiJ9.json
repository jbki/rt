a great work.Every aspect.Although there are a little terms are worth considering:For example,the design of Corvus Glaive and Proxima Midnight?just from movie,they can overtake Vision and Wanda?but Cap,Black widow and Falcon can compete with them,with some Wanda's help;and the Black Orders all were killed in this movie;and most of killings are done by Thanos himself;Starlord didn't control his emotion well when Ironman team work together to take off Thanos's glove.However,the level of the amazing of this movie are largely cover these small problems:the action between Corvus Glaive,Proxima Midnight and Cap's team is so cool and awesome,and Black Orders's power have showed very good,the fight between them and avengers are so awesome,these parts all are so cool that we can't blame the \"problems\"Â  too much.?actually these \"problem\" I mentioned above can't be called problem completely?they are just worth considering.And in fact you can find some reasons to explain for those \"problems\"?maybe not very reasonable?but at least you can find some?:For example,for the fight between Corvus Glaive,Proxima Midnight and Cap's team,the Cap take the weapon of Corvus Glaive?with this powerful weapon it must improve the Cap's team combat power?and the cooperating among the three members of Caps' are great,espically with some help of Wanda. ?This movie is exciting,interesting,but also moving and sad..R.I.P for the characters who sacrifice..\n\nThis is really a good movie that I have to watch it at least twice.The plots,multiple view switching?special effects,many moving and excting parts,and so on...they are all great.I plan to watch it again when the movie came to the cinema of Mainland China.\nAnd,of course,I really enjoy this trip that come to HK to watch Avengers:Infinity War with my friends.We really have a good time,although feel a little busy and a little tired,we are happy.Sometimes I think the Marvel give us many things,it's not just a movie or a symbol simply.It's about moving,emtions,youth?it really gives us a good life.Thank you?...maybe I can't @ all of the people who contributed for these great works,including the friends and the fans who make me feel warm and like a family.But remember I really appreciate and love you guys.\nI have been a Marvel fan for many years,and I really learn something and feel something from that.I will keep supporting,and make my every effort to realize my dream to make the marvel,and all the things we love,better.","displayName":"R

Too much fighting. Even though the graphics were amazing. Heros even looked shabby and were lame. interaction between each other had zero chemistry. If you like to see all your heros look like losers with no potential then you will love this movie. Jokes were reaching for it and fell short every time. Flashback at the end with Gomorrah... super lame. The cliff hanger at the end seemed depressing and too final and needed a glimpse of the promise of a way out. Worst avengers movie ever.
