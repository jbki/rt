It still has all of the hilarious, side-splitting banter that's been such a mainstay of the other movies, however it also goes places that movies of this nature hardly ever go for fear of alienating mainstream audiences. There are some scenes that can catch people off guard the first time around and really challenge what they come to expect from big budget superhero flicks in general. I will say that Thanos is unequivocally the greatest villain that the MCU has ever come up with and he might be up there with some of the classic villains of cinematic history like Darth Vader, Voldemort and Sauron. In my opinion this does for the Marvel films what \"The Last Jedi\" does for the Star Wars films as we find our heroes at their lowest ebb, which makes us curious as to how they will forge on in their respective sequels. Definitely something to see multiple times for sure.","displayName":"Colby S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T22:49:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T22:51:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"907049431","realm":"RT","displayName":"Colby S","accountLink":"/user/id/907049431"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"If anyone in thinking about seeing this so called movie DONT DONT DONT !!!
