To me, Infinity War (and part 2) is not meant to be a standalone movie. It is the climax scene to the end of a very long play. Yes, you'll have to watch 20 movies to understand it all, but it is a format never achieved before. It is the final chapter of a vast array of standalone films that merge as one, and that, in my opinion, is why this film is a masterpiece, and should not be so narrowly analyzed.","displayName":"sputnik 9","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T08:09:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T08:17:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"900931422","realm":"RT","displayName":"sputnik 9","accountLink":"/user/id/900931422"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Seemed like they were running out of budget and had to end the story middle of nowhere after a good start and burning all money.","displayName":"Rafa A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T08:08:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T00:47:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248295","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rafa A","accountLink":"/user/id/977248295"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I think most critics are missing the point. Its a great movie! It is the first of a two parter, and the stakes have to be high. I think the Russo's did a great job, and managing all the players.
