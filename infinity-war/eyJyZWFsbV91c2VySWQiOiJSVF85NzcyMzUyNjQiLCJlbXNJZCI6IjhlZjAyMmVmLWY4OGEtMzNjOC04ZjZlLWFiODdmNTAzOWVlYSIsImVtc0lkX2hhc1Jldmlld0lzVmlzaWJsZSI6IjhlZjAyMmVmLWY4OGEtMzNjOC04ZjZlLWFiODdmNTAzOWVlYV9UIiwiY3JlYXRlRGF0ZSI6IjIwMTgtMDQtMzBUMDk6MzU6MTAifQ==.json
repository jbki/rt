It tries way to hard to be Star Wars with the space battles and the score. Many Avengers die but this movie struggles to have an emotional impact. Frankly I don't care. It seems like Marvel searched through every website aiming to predict who live and dies, picked the least likely ones and was like \"that's fine, let's do that.\" Robert Downey Jr. is this movies top billed actor and he is in the movie for maybe ten minutes, no joke. There are few moments in this movie where I was amazed. It is loud and very crowded. The tone is everywhere and it just doesn't work. I never want to see this movie again.","displayName":"Mikayla  J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T09:30:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T09:55:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250848","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mikayla  J","accountLink":"/user/id/977250848"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Worth the 10 year wait 100 percent","displayName":"Deshawn W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T09:30:00.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T09:31:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250850","realm":"RT","displayName":"Deshawn W","accountLink":"/user/id/977250850"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"WTF EVERYONE THAT WAS BADASS DIED","displayName":"christian r","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T09:29:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T09:37:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250847","realm":"RT","displayName":"christian r","accountLink":"/user/id/977250847"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely loved it!
