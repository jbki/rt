Still I was anxious when I walked into theater because I thought it was next to impossible to pull off such a film, and boy was I wrong.\n\nThis film is everything I wanted it to be and more. The story is told from a unique perspective, it features great characters and the action is very well shot.\n\nYes, the CGI is less than stellar sometimes like so many Marvel movies before, but this can be forgiven when the action is this well shot, and the characters are this likeable.\n\nAll the actors bring their A-game but for me Chris Pratt's Star Lord really stands out here as a character whose forced to make probably the hardest decisions in the film.\n\nEveryone, go out and see this movie. It's well worth your time and money.","displayName":"Wessel K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002669883217/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-18T18:12:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-18T18:12:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"940040230","realm":"RT","displayName":"Wessel K","accountLink":"/user/id/940040230"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Normally, I fall asleep during Marvel movies.

I was never a huge Marvel fan, I always enjoyed watching any Avengers film, but I was COMPLETELY blown away after seeing Avengers: Infinity War. There's only a small list of movies that have taken my breath away after seeing them, and Infinity War is definitely one of them. From the incredible cast and character list, to the memorizing special effects, Avengers: Infinity War does not shy away from moments that make you rethink everything you have known about the Marvel Universe. One of my favorite parts about Avengers: Infinity War is the score, it really helped tie in the special effects in addition to the story-line, which contained both dramatic and comical scenes. The one thing you need to know is that the ending will truly, mess. you. up. Even if you are not a fan of the Avengers and you see this movie, you will still feel shocked.","displayName":"spooky b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-18T09:16:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-18T09:52:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"977424453","realm":"RT","displayName":"spooky b","accountLink":"/user/id/977424453"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved the movie, but made me sad ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-18T06:18:07.579Z","updateDate":"2018-08-18T06:18:07.579Z","user":{"userId":"963030092","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/963030092"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 18, 2018"}]}
