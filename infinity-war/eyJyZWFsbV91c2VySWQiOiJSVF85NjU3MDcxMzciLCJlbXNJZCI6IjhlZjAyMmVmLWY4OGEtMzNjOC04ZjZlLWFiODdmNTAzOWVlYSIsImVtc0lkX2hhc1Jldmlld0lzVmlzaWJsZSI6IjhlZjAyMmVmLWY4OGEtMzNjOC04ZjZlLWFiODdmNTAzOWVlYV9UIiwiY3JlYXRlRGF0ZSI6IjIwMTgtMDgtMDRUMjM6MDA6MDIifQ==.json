But for a surprising change the real main focus of this movie is the villian and this really does feel like mostly thanos's film. Since the movie gives us so much time with the villain it really lets us connect with him and understand why hes doing what hes doing. Thanos truly is the best villain the MCU has ever seen in my opinion. Something i loved especially about the character was just how brutal he truly was since another issue the previous villains had was that some of them really didn't feel like big threats at times but Thanos changes all of that from the very beginning the opening scene he really shows the audience just how badass and brutal he really is and for the first time in an mcu movie i think we can all say that the villian was the greatest part of the movie.\n\nDespite Thanos really being the main highlight of the movie thats not to say that the rest of the movie wasn't amazing also. The heroes as well in this movie were fantastic some standout performances would have to be RDJ , Tom holland , Benedict Cumberbatch and Chris Hemsworth , many more also . In my opinion i would have to say the standout hero of this film is Thor, one of the main reasons why the character worked so well for me is because he is given an arc at the beginning and his arc actually does finish by the end and the wakanda entrance by him is the most standout scene and my favourite scene of the entire film. All and all both the villian and heroes are brilliant.\n\nThe issues i have with the film simply just revolve around the hulk and how he was utilized. It's not that i have an issue with the hulk not coming out in the movie despite the beginning as i know that it connects to what will happen in Avengers 4 so im not to bothered about that. The execution of it is what annoys me as although at times in the film it feels as though the scene should feel dramatic when the hulk wont come out it is always played for laughs and never feels serious but despite that small issue i have i think this movie is a true master piece. No i do not think this is the best marvel movie but it is my favourite at the moment. Overall fantastic experience watching this.","displayName":"Jack M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-04T18:44:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-04T19:13:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"977396830","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jack M","accountLink":"/user/id/977396830"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Marvel delivers your definitive movie, with breathtaking action sequences and a respectful villain.","displayName":"Lucca G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-04T16:40:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-04T16:42:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"977396623","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lucca G","accountLink":"/user/id/977396623"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"#MovieReview 3,5 ??

Then it was way to many characters used in the movie, but overall a good movie.","displayName":"Am J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-04T13:04:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-04T13:24:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"977396259","realm":"RT","displayName":"Am J","accountLink":"/user/id/977396259"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It is a great movie...! excellent.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1949107171799656/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-04T07:44:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-04T07:46:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"977395831","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977395831"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"AVENGERS:INFINITY WAR is AWESOMEMAZING.Looking forward to upcoming AVENGERS 4 next year.","displayName":"Jay D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-04T07:03:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-04T07:09:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"977395768","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jay D","accountLink":"/user/id/977395768"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 04, 2018"}]}
