A lot of negative reviews state that the characters have no story arc in this film, what they don't seem to understand is that the 18 films leading up to Infinity were the 1st act of this story while Infinity is just the 2nd act. And we didn't need to dive into each character in this film, the heroes had their arcs before this, this film was Thanos' arc. This was his film and Brolin brought the mad titan to life. Thanks is the villain we always wanted. bring on the 3rd act!!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/143840579801459/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T23:03:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T23:12:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241265","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977241265"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A slow burn that is worth waiting for.","displayName":"Brian P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/604653078/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T23:03:02.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T23:03:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"790239357","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian P","accountLink":"/user/id/790239357"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Certainly lived up to all the hype. 10 years in the making, so you get 2.30 min of a film that is just one big third act.

After a decade of Marvel movies that are supposed to Culminate in an epic story, this movie disappoints.   2 and a half hours of depressing loss after loss, I felt robbed.   this movie left me feeling empty, let down, and discouraged.   I am a comic book fan and this did not mirror the comic story not was it an enticing adaptation.   It was obvious that it was just an attempt to continue the movies coming out and leaves you dreading the next several years of movies that will not fix anything this movie destroyed.   Super heroes are not supposed to be depressing political stories of over population where everything you come to love and cherish gets destroyed just so they can make 10 more movies and a statement.   I will not go see this again.   Captain Marvel will not be the savior of the franchise.   Shame on Marvel and Disney for putting this film out.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1844170252273326/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T23:00:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T23:08:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241257","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977241257"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Con\nThe film lacks general big picture in story, and felt likes combinations of small stories. Some jokes here and there that felt random and not funny. They should have stick to the comic all mighty Thanos, rather than this. I would rather remember Thanos as the one from Advangers one ending, rather than this guy. \nPro\nIt contains some nice fight scenes. Nice set designs and visual effects. At least it does have a story.","displayName":"Steve Y","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T23:00:32.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T23:21:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241255","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steve Y","accountLink":"/user/id/977241255"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"When I first saw the trailer I wanted to see that movie!
