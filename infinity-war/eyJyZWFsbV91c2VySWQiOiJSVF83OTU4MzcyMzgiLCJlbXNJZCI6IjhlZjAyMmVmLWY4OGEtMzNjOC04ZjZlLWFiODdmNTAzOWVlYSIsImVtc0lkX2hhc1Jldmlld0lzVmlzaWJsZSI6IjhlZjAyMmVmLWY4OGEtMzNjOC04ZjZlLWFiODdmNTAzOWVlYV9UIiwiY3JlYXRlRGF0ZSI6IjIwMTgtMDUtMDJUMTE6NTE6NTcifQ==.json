It has managed to keep emotion strong each time I've seen it despite me knowing each and every twist and turn. Also the proformance of Tom Holland truly stands out to me. He elevated the Spider-Man character to an all new level that blows all past protrails of the characters out of the water. Also they delivered the best villain I've seen in a long time. He was not a 2D character, he had depth. You understood his motivation, he saw himself as a hero. He shed tears, he felt remorse but managed to stay terrifying to the audience and the heroes alike. Not only did the Russo brothers deliver an amazing movie that brought together ten years of films, but also lived up to the expectations of fans and casual watchers alike. I highly recommend supporting and seeing this movie. It'll have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. And it has an worth while and unexpected ending leaving you in the same shock as the heroes on screen. Truly amazing.","displayName":"Cole F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T11:00:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T11:13:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"975108694","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cole F","accountLink":"/user/id/975108694"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"HAwkeye in poster not in movie.....","displayName":"Nicolas P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/689324817917905/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T10:53:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T10:54:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"976399810","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nicolas P","accountLink":"/user/id/976399810"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Acción, drama, suspenso, culmina esta parte del MCU, no puedes pedir más!
