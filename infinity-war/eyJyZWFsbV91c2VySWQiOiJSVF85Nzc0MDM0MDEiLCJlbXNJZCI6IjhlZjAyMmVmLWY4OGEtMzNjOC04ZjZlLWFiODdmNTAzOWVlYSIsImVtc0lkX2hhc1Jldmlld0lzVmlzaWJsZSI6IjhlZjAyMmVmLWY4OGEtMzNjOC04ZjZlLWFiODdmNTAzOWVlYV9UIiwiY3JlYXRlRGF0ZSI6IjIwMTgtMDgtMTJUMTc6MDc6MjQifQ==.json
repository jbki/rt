Its the first time that i see the villain be as stong as he is said to be. And the first time that a villain does the things he does because of something that actually IS pretty understandable. If you love avengers, good CGI, good acting, \"saving the world\" theme and big battles then this is the movie you are looking for. If you want something more than that then you are going to be disapointed.","displayName":"Thanos V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-12T14:43:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-12T14:44:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"977414463","realm":"RT","displayName":"Thanos V","accountLink":"/user/id/977414463"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"By far one of the best movies of 2018! What more could you want more from a movie, it's Marvel, it's action, it's a unique & ingeniously beautiful adaptation. Everyone has something different to bring to the film and I found myself connecting with each character as an individual on a near personal level. Although this is only part 1, I give props to Thanos for actually having a bad guy win a movie for once!","displayName":"Beefy C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-12T13:01:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-12T13:06:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"977414407","realm":"RT","displayName":"Beefy C","accountLink":"/user/id/977414407"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Everything you'd want in this mega blockbuster superhero film.","displayName":"Jimmy C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-12T12:30:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-12T12:31:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"976900174","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jimmy C","accountLink":"/user/id/976900174"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fantastic movie with some of the best CGI I've ever seen.
