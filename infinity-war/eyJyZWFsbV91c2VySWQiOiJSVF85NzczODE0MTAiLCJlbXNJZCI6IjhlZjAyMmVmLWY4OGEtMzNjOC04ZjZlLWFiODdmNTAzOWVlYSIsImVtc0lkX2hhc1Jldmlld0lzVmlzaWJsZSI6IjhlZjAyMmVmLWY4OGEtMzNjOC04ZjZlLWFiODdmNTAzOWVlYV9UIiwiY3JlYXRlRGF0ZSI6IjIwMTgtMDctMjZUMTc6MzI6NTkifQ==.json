Despite it's shocking ending, The Avengers: Infinity War is an amazing, awesome, excellent, and flawless movie that is for sure one of the best. Can't wait for the forth one. This movie is absolutely Oscar worthy great. The characters are great. The villain is of course easy to hate. This is the movie that people should love so much just like I do. The Avengers: Infinity War is the bomb.","displayName":"Max N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-25T17:34:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-25T17:40:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"953042225","realm":"RT","displayName":"Max N","accountLink":"/user/id/953042225"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"As a huge fan of the MCU, Marvel Cinematic Universe, this movie is absolutely fantastic to me. After 10, long years of Marvel movies, we get a movie that connects all of them, besides one movie that I won't say for spoiler reasons. However, I do understand that this movie can be fan service. This happens to be the single flaw I found in this movie. If you don't know what I mean by that, It means that you probably won't understand this movie if you haven't, at least, seen a couple of the MCU films. Besides that, this movie is a touching, adventurous, superhero classic that you will thoroughly enjoy, as long as you like superhero films and understand the franchise.","displayName":"Gannon M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-25T13:21:14.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-25T13:21:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"977379903","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gannon M","accountLink":"/user/id/977379903"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Fights were fun. bit of a dead fish when it comes to emotional response.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2123810551276024/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-25T09:15:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-25T09:16:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"977379647","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977379647"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Their are so many fantastic characters in this film and yet it doesn't manage to feel crowded. The villlain is fantastic and has a realistic motive. The movie was very funny yet was able to capture many emotional scenes. The only real criticism I have is that I feel they could have done more with some characters but that's bound to happen in a film with this many people. All in all it's a great movie with a ending that makes you want more and will leave you crying at the same time.","displayName":"Ray C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-25T08:42:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-25T08:48:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"977379602","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ray C","accountLink":"/user/id/977379602"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was a masterpiece.
