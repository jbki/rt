Thanos is up to evil and this time he's got the Infinity Gauntlet with 2 of the 6 stones already (to start).  Highly entertaining 2.5 hours that will fly by in a heartbeat and you'll LOVE every single second of it ......... until the last second.  After the final easter egg finished (wait for ALL the credits which take 20 minutes at least and makes you realize the scope of this flick) the entire theater seemed to fire up their phones simultaneously, look at each other and say \"WTF\".  Then you're greeted with a \"Thanos will return\" message at the last on the screen.  Duh?  Seriously - it's a hugely epic film.  It ties so much together and is just colossal in scope.  It's so well done that I'm going back again to be puzzled again.  Although I'm sure Dr. Strange and his last line have much to do with the next chapter.  And there is a next chapter. Go see it.  In iMAX preferably or at least a great theater with a great screen and sound system.","displayName":"David P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1313118342/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T12:04:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T12:14:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"869274646","realm":"RT","displayName":"David P","accountLink":"/user/id/869274646"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"\"In time, you will know what it's like to lose...\"\nThis film really does emphasize on that message, and the portrayal of death in this movie is something that Marvel Studios has never touched upon. Seeing the Avengers dying left and right throughout the film has more of an impact than one might expect. \n\nIt has been said before that the villan Thanos, was designed to be comparable to Darth Vadar from the Star Wars franchise. I believe they have surpassed what Darth Vadar ever was for fans, and Thanos will be remembered as a far more iconic character.  \n\nI think this film has accomplished it's goal, and it has definitely raised the bar for future films in the genre. DC is out of the question, in my opinion.","displayName":"Enfinity %","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T12:04:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T12:12:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243140","realm":"RT","displayName":"Enfinity %","accountLink":"/user/id/977243140"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The culmination of 10 years greatly paying off.
