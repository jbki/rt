The best part was seeing all the mcu characters together in one movie. The ending  well to me was a big let down, considering the fact that we know alot of the actors have contracts for more movies. The VFX was done nicely even though some CG was a bit off. The score was good,  and the end credit scene was short but gives you something to look forward to. In the end Infinity Was an ok film, but it was more the experience of it all that I loved. To  Marvel fans I definitely recommend, to casual viewers it's a bit all over the place pacing wise but the action is great , so I also recommend.","displayName":"Robert R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T07:38:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T18:54:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"977130675","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert R","accountLink":"/user/id/977130675"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Is there is any word more than awesome, it fit's for this movie","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1979389979043254/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T07:18:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T02:22:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977235012","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977235012"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"My least favorite Marvel movie. It is very clear that the script was written by dudes, because love as a driving force behind their narrative only leads to negative outcomes: it brings about weakness, irrational impulsivity, bad decision-making and cumulatively causes the doomsday in the universe. Marvel & other super-stories justifiably don’t stray far from the classic hero’s journeys, but the IW’s level of banality combined with the tortured ending that was transparently “trying too hard to be different” - the mix of the two killed my vibe. I’m feeling Trump-kind of SAD!!! because I really wanted to like this Avengers installment... :/ ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T07:03:14.037Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T03:25:11.409Z","user":{"userId":"907670872","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/907670872"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Everything I expected and whole lot more...
