Constant forced humor in terrible places that didn’t work, and same old fight scenes overdone to a gratuitous point. A lot of convenient plotting with an end that seems like a cop out cliffhanger. Also they turned hulk into a complete inferior useless member of the avenger team and to me that’s blasphemy.Overall a massively fun ride due to amazing visuals and action but quite overhyped and overrated.

The acting is great across the board, and the action is high-stakes, fun, and intense. Josh Brolin steals the show as Thanos, making the villain relatable but not quite likable; a difficult task he almost makes look easy. The visuals are dazzling, the musical score is phenomenal, and the story never feels slow despite the movie's 2.5 hour runtime. It does underuse a few characters, but this doesn't hamper the film's quality. Overall, Infinity War may not have exceeded expectations, but it definitely met them.","displayName":"Ryan H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T11:21:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T11:22:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"953803284","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan H","accountLink":"/user/id/953803284"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Marvel movie so far ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T11:16:15.158Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T11:16:15.158Z","user":{"userId":"260000084","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260000084"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"OMG best Marvel Movie so far, I loved it!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1699430740149921/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T11:04:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T11:05:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"977260628","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977260628"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing movie 10/10,Josh Brolin did a fantastic job as Thanos I thought","displayName":"Carter L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T11:01:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T11:02:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"977260624","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carter L","accountLink":"/user/id/977260624"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"the movie is very good, although the run time is 2 hours and 40 minutes there is so much going on it was very good!
