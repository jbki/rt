Superheroes fighting against evil is nothing new in Marvel world, but when the action scenes become the main focus of the film then it may lose the purpose of a movie.  Use of way too much visual effects cannot substitute the weak storyline, which I felt director probably hadn't thought about. \nThe story could've been more captivating if the audience could build connection with one or limited number of superheroes first before encountering one after another before the plot thickens.   Perhaps the movie wanted to portray that everything will not last forever, even superheroes may decay, but the bonding with each other for which someone can sacrifice own superpower, for instance, Doctor Strange giving away his superpower in return of Iron Man's life, with no doubt, was praiseworthy nevertheless fails to engage audience with the struggle and passion in that very moment. \nAlso in my opinion the ending was too quick not in a good way though, the death of some superheroes leaves viewer with a question whether why they had to die? Although the sound track, editing and the script kept the viewer awake. And remarkable costume design caught the attention of the fans. Despite the inadequate storyline, the acting of superheroes was one of the biggest strength of the movie. One of the biggest standouts was actually Josh Brolin as Thanos, we all know which just the voice of Brolin, however, was combined with the really well-done computer graphics and the emotional development of Thanos was able to make a truly powerful villain come to life.\nIf we consider the movie in terms of profit Marvel crawls to the top of \"most profited movie\" list with applause, undoubtedly, Marvel is successful to leave the fans with \"what next\" question and that will trigger us as a fan to see the coming episode, for sure.","displayName":"Rufas R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-31T01:49:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-31T01:56:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"977299800","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rufas R","accountLink":"/user/id/977299800"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 31, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"So entertaining from beginning to end.

Even with the size of the cast seemingly too large to produce any meaningful plot development, even with such a simple story arc of ''hey let's work together to stop Thanos,' Infinity War somehow pulls it off and went above and beyond what I expected of it. While a few scenes I thought could be done better *cough* Starlord *cough* for the most part, I was on the edge of my seat riding that emotional rollercoaster and couldn't wait to see what happened next. It was just plain amazing and I'm glad I got to fully experience this in the theater. I usually wait for movies to leave theaters before I go see them, but for these ones they've earned an exception.","displayName":"Daryl S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-30T22:57:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-30T23:47:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977299669","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daryl S","accountLink":"/user/id/977299669"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 30, 2018"}]}
