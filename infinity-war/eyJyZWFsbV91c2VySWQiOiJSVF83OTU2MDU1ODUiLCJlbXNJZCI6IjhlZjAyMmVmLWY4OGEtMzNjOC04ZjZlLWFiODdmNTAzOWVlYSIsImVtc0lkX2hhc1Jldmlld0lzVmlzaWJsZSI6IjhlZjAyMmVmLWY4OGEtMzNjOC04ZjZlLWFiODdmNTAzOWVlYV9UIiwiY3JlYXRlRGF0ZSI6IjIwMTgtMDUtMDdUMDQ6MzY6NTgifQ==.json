This, however, disturbs the stable limit cycle and creates an unstable equilibrium. After the increase of the carrying capacity, the peak of the prey nullcline parabola has moved to the right of the predator nullcline, creating an unstable spiral as time progresses. From an ecological standpoint, this movie sucks and is based on absolute hogwash.
