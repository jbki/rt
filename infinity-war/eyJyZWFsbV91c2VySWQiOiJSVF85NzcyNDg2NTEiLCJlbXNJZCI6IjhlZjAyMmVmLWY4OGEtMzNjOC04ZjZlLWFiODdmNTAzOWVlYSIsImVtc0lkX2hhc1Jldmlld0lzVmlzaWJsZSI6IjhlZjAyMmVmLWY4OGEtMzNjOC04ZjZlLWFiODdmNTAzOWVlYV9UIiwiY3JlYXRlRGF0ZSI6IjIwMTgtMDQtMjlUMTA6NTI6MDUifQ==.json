Every frame every second, it's all thanos.\nI love the change of character of thanos from being a live sick maniac to someone with a huge God complex, in his ownen twisted way he is the liberator of the worlds, he thinks he is right and doing good by destroying worlds, just like any other dictator thinks. He is so flawed and shocked by the district in of his world that he can't even see the error in his ways. The movie poses the question, is it right to do the unthinkable for the greater good.? This question resonates with the current state of our socity.\nGreat story telling, no way anyone would have been able to pull such a huge movie though, with so many  storylines and so many characters. Action was awesome.\nYet I think it would have been better if marvel would have further broken this movie into two parts, one dealing with children of thanos and other about the war with Thanos.","displayName":"Vikram B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T10:44:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T10:57:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"936176095","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vikram B","accountLink":"/user/id/936176095"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A cinematic marvel which tells a narrative which lives up to being ten years in the making! I do not know how the Russo Brothers are so able to juggle between serious/poignant at one moment, and seriously hilarious at another but it leads to two and a half hours of flying-by-the-seat-of-your-trousers action which I can't wait to see surpassed next year, as tall an order as that may be!","displayName":"Matt L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T10:44:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-18T08:38:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"961681997","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt L","accountLink":"/user/id/961681997"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I fucking hate the movie\n\nThe damn bad character loves to pop up every damn 5 seconds, i dont get the ending.

If you haven't seen at least half of the other MCU movies, then you need to stay home because this movie is not for you. You won't feel the emotional impact of the events that occur if you are not already emotionally invested in characters present in the movie. The movie will just be a tedious exercise to you. I loved this movie. It was unpredictable, and most importantly, it had stakes. There are heartwrenching moments that will make you cry out and beg Thanos to stop what he's doing, because god damn, he is an unstoppable force.","displayName":"Courtney D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T10:33:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T10:38:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"977119057","realm":"RT","displayName":"Courtney D","accountLink":"/user/id/977119057"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great action, but i wish we've gotten more dynamic character mix\nbut the ending was excellent, i just wanted to stay in the theater and wait there for Part 2","displayName":"Yoni K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10212305337281084/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T10:33:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T10:35:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"976531936","realm":"RT","displayName":"Yoni K","accountLink":"/user/id/976531936"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"}]}
