The  heroes that appeared in the movie were really good and they all contributed to the movie some more some less but overall great marvel hero mashup with cool action sequences. The only downside of the movie was its duration cuz to tell this huge story it needs time and it was pretty fast paced and too short telling.","displayName":"Ahmetbasic S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/413066232836065/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-08T11:22:00.000Z","updateDate":"2019-07-18T08:53:03.630Z","user":{"userId":"977879457","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ahmetbasic S","accountLink":"/user/id/977879457"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It's worth watching.","displayName":"Peter H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-08T10:50:26.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-08T11:03:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"977864039","realm":"RT","displayName":"Peter H","accountLink":"/user/id/977864039"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great throughout and what put this over the top for me for a 4 star was the ending with no-holds-barred.","displayName":"Andrew J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1014375526/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-08T10:23:08.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-18T14:09:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"836769439","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew J","accountLink":"/user/id/836769439"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Worst marvel  film yet","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/820710954944720/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-08T03:54:40.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-08T03:57:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"977844895","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977844895"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie.
