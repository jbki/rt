Never before have we seen a film of this scale, with over 10 years of build up, come to life before our eyes and work so well. To the critics who are attacking this film I ask what film they have seen...because it was not the one that roughly $630 million dollars worth of people ended up seeing. Avoid spoilers at all cost and be ready to sit back, eat some popcorn, and enjoy the ride that has been 10 years in the making. Kudos to the Russo Brothers for once again delivering an amazing film. Though the weakness is in the fact that this is obviously setting up for the next film, it creates the needed anticipation of fans to ask, \"why do I have to wait a year?!?\" For any film to do that is a success. No question.","displayName":"Ian H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1211520585/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T05:22:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T05:22:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"801988550","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ian H","accountLink":"/user/id/801988550"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Not appropriate for kids! Way too dark - and the ending?! It is downright cynical to have a movie that is marketed to kids end on a downer of such cataclysmic proportions!  My kids were so excited about the movie, so I took them on opening day. Over 48 hours later, they are still reeling from the experience. Makes me incredibly mad at Marvel (and the media that went along with it): To maximize mass appeal, they obtained a PG-13 rating and emphasized the light-hearted aspects of the movie in the massive hype leading up to its release. Whereas the movie's message is dystopian in the extreme (spoiler alert!) with evil triumphing. It is hard enough preserving my kids' innocence when faced with the incessant onslaught of sleeziness and corruption that has come to characterize the news cycle in the United States. Why, Marvel, did you have to ruin what was a family-friendly franchise delivering much-needed escapism?!  If, in the name of art, you were going to go wallow in such darkness (hello, DC Comics!) at least have the decency to warn unsuspecting parents with an\"R\" rating and less misleading advertising...","displayName":"Christian S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T05:18:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T05:49:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250464","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christian S","accountLink":"/user/id/977250464"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is the best superhero movie to date.

I gotta sat ladies and gentlemen, this was my absolute favorite MCU movie yet!!! With all the characters they had to touch on, they did equal service to all. Except for Cap maybe, but I hope he will have a bigger and better part in the conclusion. I absolutely loved how Thanos was transitioned to cinema, the comic version just would not have worked. (but there is a nice solution to that ðŸ˜‰) The only reason why I gave it 4.5 and not 5 was cause of gauntlet maker/plot hole...and maybe cause I KNOW some things will be reversed.
