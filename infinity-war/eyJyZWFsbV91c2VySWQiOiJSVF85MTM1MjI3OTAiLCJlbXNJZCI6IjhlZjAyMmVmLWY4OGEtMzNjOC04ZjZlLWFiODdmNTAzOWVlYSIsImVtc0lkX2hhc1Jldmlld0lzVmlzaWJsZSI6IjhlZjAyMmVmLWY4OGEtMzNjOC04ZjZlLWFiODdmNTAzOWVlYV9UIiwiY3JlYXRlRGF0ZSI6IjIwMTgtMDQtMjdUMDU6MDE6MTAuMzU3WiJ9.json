Infinity War is bold, juggles more characters than you can comprehend gracefully and thoughtfully, packs a gut-punch or jaw-drop scene by scene, remains humourous and desperately emotional. As a fan, perhaps the best and maybe even only way to experience the film properly, Infinity War delivers. It's shocking, it's brutal and it thoroughly culminates ten glorious years of comic book lovers' dreams on screen. Cannot wait to see what on Earth (or in fact not) happens next.

It is totally worth it and sets up our classic and favorite Avengers united for a spectacular finish. Keep away from the negative reviews and experience this for yourself. \n\nBetter than Last Jedi.

Easily the best villain there is. great movie, lots of fun, fantastic funny moments between members, insane fight scenes, defaintly not to miss.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10213602210202260/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T04:54:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T04:57:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241974","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977241974"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Watched it & going to watch it again tomorrow. \nExcellent job done by Russo brothers.
