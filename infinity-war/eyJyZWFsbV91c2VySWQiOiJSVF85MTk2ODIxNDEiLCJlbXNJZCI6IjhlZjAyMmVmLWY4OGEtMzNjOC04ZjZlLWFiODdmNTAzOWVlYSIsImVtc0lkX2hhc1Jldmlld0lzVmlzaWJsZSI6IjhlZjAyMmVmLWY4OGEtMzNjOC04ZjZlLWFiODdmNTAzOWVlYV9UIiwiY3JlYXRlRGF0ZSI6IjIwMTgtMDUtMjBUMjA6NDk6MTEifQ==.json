The movie did feel jumbled a bit (Everyone expected that), but aside from that, it seemed close to perfect. The tones of each team blended well with one another, the interactions between characters was perfection, CGI was fantastic, and Josh Brolin did perfect as Thanos. And also, the thought of making Thanos the main character was perfect. It made him feel like his own hero even more.

Just because they tried to put every character they have in this movie does not mean it was good. The story and the effects were weak and it did not progress as you would expect every superhero movie to do this one broke the mold in a bad way. This maybe just seems to be a set up for more movies they want me to go see. guess what staying away from the theater for a while","displayName":"Rob K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10206160248874836/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-20T18:53:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-20T18:58:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"975069241","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rob K","accountLink":"/user/id/975069241"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The culmination of 10 years of Marvel Studio magic!?
