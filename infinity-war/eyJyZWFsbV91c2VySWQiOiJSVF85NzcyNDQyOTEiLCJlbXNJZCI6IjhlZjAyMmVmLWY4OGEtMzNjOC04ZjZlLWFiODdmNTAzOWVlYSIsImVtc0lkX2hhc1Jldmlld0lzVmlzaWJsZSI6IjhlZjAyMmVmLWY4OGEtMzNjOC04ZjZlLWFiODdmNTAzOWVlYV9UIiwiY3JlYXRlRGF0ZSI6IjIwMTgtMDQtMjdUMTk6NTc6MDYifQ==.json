This is the best production for this movie genre that I've ever seen.  The producers and director realized that to have credible drama you need credible villains.  There are so many super heros they could have made this a mini-series.  Well paced and doesn't take itself too seriously.  The language and intensity might be a bit much for young audiences.  And they know how to set up a sequel.","displayName":"Allan F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T19:50:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T19:55:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"908686487","realm":"RT","displayName":"Allan F","accountLink":"/user/id/908686487"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
