Now after feeling totally gut punched through the 3rd act, I have to wait a whole year to see the end result of this behemoth. Great acting all around, but this definitely wasn't what I was expecting. I never read the comics this is adapted from, so I was not exactly jumping for joy & laughing out loud through this latest episode in the MCU.

If you are emotionally invested in ANY of the storylines in the MCU that have led to this point I highly recommend you just stop watching now. Marvel has officially entered the point where they sacrifice quality storytelling for maximum profit. From the sympathetic moments with a genocidal monster to the whale of a Deus ex Machina the writers will need to move forward, Infinity war does not fail to disappoint.\nSPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!! \nAnd fair warning? The End Credit scene (that's right just one) comes at the very end of the credits and involves another 2 minutes of people dying. I'd recommend not bothering with it.","displayName":"Jesse S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T18:49:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T19:11:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"977255713","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jesse S","accountLink":"/user/id/977255713"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Marvel finally made a film where it had stakes, high tension, and a great villain that really takes this series to some new levels.

It was interesting to switch between the different story lines, but within the first twenty minutes, It started to get boring. I must say it was nice to them really show the true power of THOR in the movie. Previously they have under powered the character, so it was great to see them show his full power. Surprisingly several of the characters didn't get much screen-time and not using HULK other than the first few minutes of the movie was a let down, as he is easily able to take on Thanos. The storyline seemed a bit dry for me at times. I just hope that PART 2 will be better than this part.","displayName":"Ty W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T18:06:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T18:12:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"916104354","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ty W","accountLink":"/user/id/916104354"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Laughed, rolled my eyes, laughed some more, then felt almost sick with sadness. 10/10, would bawl again.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1777076772323539/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T17:47:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T17:48:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"977053874","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977053874"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The movie is very plot-driven, and the characters are great as well. There is one downside to the film that's some of its characters were under use, but that is the one problem about this movie. Thanos is such a great villain, the ending leaves you off on a cliffhanger that which made wondering even more about Avengers 4 than I did before seeing this film. The movie was very emotional and it made laugh, cry, and shocked. So I think anyone reading this should check out the movie and I promise you will enjoy it as much as I did.","displayName":"Hunter W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T17:45:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T17:54:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"977255664","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hunter W","accountLink":"/user/id/977255664"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"So so horribly boring.
