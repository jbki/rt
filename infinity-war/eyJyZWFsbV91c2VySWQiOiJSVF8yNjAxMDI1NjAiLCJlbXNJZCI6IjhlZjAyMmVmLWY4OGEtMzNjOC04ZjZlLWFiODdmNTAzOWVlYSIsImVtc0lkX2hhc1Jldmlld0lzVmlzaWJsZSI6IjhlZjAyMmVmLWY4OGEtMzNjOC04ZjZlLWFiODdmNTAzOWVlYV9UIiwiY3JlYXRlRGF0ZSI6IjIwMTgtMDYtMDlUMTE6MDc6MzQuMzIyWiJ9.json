It did a particularly good job of weaving several story lines together (all contributing to the overall plot) with a multitude of characters  -- movie is very character heavy.  This only works if you already know every character very well, which Marvel has been working on for over a decade to establish in other movies.  Do not go see this movie unless you have at least seen 4 or 5 other Marvel superhero movies.","displayName":"Jack S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-09T08:09:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-09T08:11:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"977069888","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jack S","accountLink":"/user/id/977069888"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"2nd best movie ever!!! ??","displayName":"Rowan%20 F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-09T05:42:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-09T05:43:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"977311662","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rowan%20 F","accountLink":"/user/id/977311662"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie ever seen to human eyes.","displayName":"Joab S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-09T05:15:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-09T05:16:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"977311659","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joab S","accountLink":"/user/id/977311659"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The definition of a blockbuster.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-09T05:00:18.475Z","updateDate":"2018-06-09T05:00:18.475Z","user":{"userId":"783386494","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/783386494"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I’m not really surprised that we got yet another trash movie by Disney/marvel but I was optimistic that it would be good.
