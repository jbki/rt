Such intricate weaving of Fandom with casual movie going is difficult at the best of times. This movie came together in such a splendid intertwining of deep marvel comic cannon, along with seat of your pants summer blockbuster action. They did it. As a seasoned comic book fan, I gotta say, they've done this the justice they were capable of. Full credit to the portrayal of Thanos, and the excellently balanced heroes that pop in and out of the action to attempt to that him. This is exactly the way to make this movie.\nForget any expectations, roll with the emotions and enjoy the ride, cause this is akin to the empire strikes back!","displayName":"Joshua C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000386084012/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T23:50:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T00:00:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"891736740","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joshua C","accountLink":"/user/id/891736740"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"I could have waited for the DVD","displayName":"Michael S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T23:48:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T23:49:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"921853230","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael S","accountLink":"/user/id/921853230"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Everything I wanted and more","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2546293928730083/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T23:48:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T23:48:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241357","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977241357"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A fantastic movie that adds real world stakes, dramatic moments of gut punches and heart wrenching action sequences to a dark and intense film. Well written and giving a large cast of characters their due. Everyone has a moment to shine. Pacing was off in some parts but this is an epic culmination film with a cast of 34 people.  Everyone    should know this is a prelude or part 1 to Avengers 4 part 2. The cliffhanger ending was sad, emotional, shocking and more. I give this film a 93 out of 100. It is among the top 3 marvel films just for the chances it takes in the film. It's long with some setup but in the end it is needed and justified. Very funny moments of humor and levity . Everyone brought their A game. Definitely met my expectations.","displayName":"Matthew R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T23:48:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T23:55:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"911298037","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew R","accountLink":"/user/id/911298037"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Incredible!
