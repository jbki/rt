A plot so spectacularly developed while the inclusion of so many characters successfully in the movie complimented the rythm and flow of the jam packed action throughout the movie. Never a boring moment. This movie did justice to the nearly decade long build up of Thanos's arrival.","displayName":"Avish R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1290990224392659/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-20T00:42:26.390Z","updateDate":"2019-07-20T00:50:47.547Z","user":{"userId":"978161498","realm":"RT","displayName":"Avish R","accountLink":"/user/id/978161498"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is so good.  The rewatchability factor of this movie is so good that you could watch it ten times in a row and you would still love it.   This movie is so well made and it is so much fun.

One of the best movies in the entire MCU.","displayName":"Jadon K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-19T16:21:25.805Z","updateDate":"2019-07-19T16:21:27.228Z","user":{"userId":"977717473","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jadon K","accountLink":"/user/id/977717473"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best.

Featuring fantastic direction from the Russo Brothers that balances each character perfectly giving the audience just the right amount of time with each hero. Josh Brolin delivers one of his best performances, and quite possibly the best performance in the film, giving Thanos true motivation that makes him a true villain you love to hate. (just as much as Heath Ledger's Joker) The performances from our heroes are also fantastic and it's hard to single out a select few as they all do a fantastic job. I love this film just as much as the first and I'm truly stunned to see where they're going with the franchise from here on out. Cause as fans we're in the Endgame now.","displayName":"Price P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/729981657440332/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-17T16:22:40.890Z","updateDate":"2019-07-17T16:22:44.722Z","user":{"userId":"978156659","realm":"RT","displayName":"Price P","accountLink":"/user/id/978156659"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Perfect and shocking!","displayName":"Jay A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-17T10:28:02.515Z","updateDate":"2019-07-17T10:28:02.515Z","user":{"userId":"978151996","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jay A","accountLink":"/user/id/978151996"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Shocking, and intense.
