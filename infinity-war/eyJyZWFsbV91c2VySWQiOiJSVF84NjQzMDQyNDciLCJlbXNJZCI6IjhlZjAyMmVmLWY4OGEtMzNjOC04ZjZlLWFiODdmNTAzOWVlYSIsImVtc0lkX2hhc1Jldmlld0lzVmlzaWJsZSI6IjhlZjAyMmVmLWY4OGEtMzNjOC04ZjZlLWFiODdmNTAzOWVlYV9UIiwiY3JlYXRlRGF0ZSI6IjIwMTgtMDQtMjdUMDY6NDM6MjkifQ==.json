Personally, I have never really cared what critics think and I think the rift between what critics want and enjoy and the general population wants and enjoys grows bigger and bigger all the time. Personally, I think this was easily one of the best films in the MCU to date. \n\nParticularly surprising is the amount of depth and screen time Thanos actually gets. And its actually quite ingenious how he was written and couldn't have come at a more perfect time give the huge number of challenges we are facing on our own planet, 99% of which can be traced right back to overpopulation. That in itself gives Thanos and his mission to wipe out half of the population of the universe a resonance that most villains just don't achieve.\n\nThis film is definitely NOT for people who are just now coming into the MCU. This film was  written from the ground up for people that have been watching Marvels films all along. Anyone who goes to see this without seeing most, if not all of the previous 18 movies.....well, those will be the people that ultimately leave the theatre disappointed as not seeing the previous film will lower the impact of EVERYTHING in this film by like a factor of 100, especially the opening 10 minutes. This is a film masterfully crafted for MCU fans and it doesn't even begin to disappoint. \n\nJust a brilliant addition to the MCU, one that makes waiting for part 2 next May that much harder!!","displayName":"MIchael N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T06:42:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-02T13:06:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"901389381","realm":"RT","displayName":"MIchael N","accountLink":"/user/id/901389381"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING.... this movie captures everything I was expecting but with a million times more ... this comedy and character interaction is amazing... I don't think I've ever laughed so much in a cinema before... this movie ultimately won't get that high of a critic review mainly due to them seeing this as a stand-alone film and not understanding this has a part 2 .... this movie also does things which isn't usual for a blockbuster movie but they pulled of of amazingly.... in my eyes and in the eyes of my closest friends who have seen this we have all said it's the perfect movie we've ever seen .... congratulations marvel ... see you soon (hurry up!!!!
