Combining 10 years and 18 films, this exceeded expectations. So many characters and action yet so many plots interwoven into one gargantuan film. The heroes bring it to the fight against their biggest threat yet Thanos, who is the most interesting character of this film. Josh Brolin imbues this character with such power yet sympathy to achieve his goal, which is to collect the six Infinity Stones and wipe out half the universe. The cast, action, visuals and music make their mark in this film as it is visually gorgeous to watch. However, the pacing feels very fast in that there are so many plotlines to establish in cover in a 2 hour and 40 minute film. The again, this film was never meant to be judged in isolation as you need to watch the previous 18 films in order to fully get it.\nUpon doing so, this film leaves a mark. It is not afraid to take risks and cement them in the face of Thanos and our heroes. The stakes are higher and the sacrifices must come. In the end, you're left with one of the most significant pop culture moments that will strike with audiences for decades to come. This isn't a perfect film, but Avengers: Infinity War brings out the boldness and makes an impact physically and emotionally for Marvel fans.

It's not pretty - I mean, it IS pretty visual effects-wise they pulled no punches (especially the motion capture of Josh Brolin as Thanos), but there's a lot crammed into Infinity War and I think it's the best it could be. First off, it should really be labelled as Part 1, because this is not a full story. This movie ends at Act Two and you just have to wait for Endgame for the rest. There's no part of you that expects what happens at the end to stay final, so it takes a bit of that drama away. That being said, the film is typical Marvel fun - seeing all of our heroes meet up and interact is fun. Some are drastically under-utilised (our friends in Wakanda) and some are at their absolute best - Chris Hemsworth plays Thor at his lowest so well and still with his boyish charm and perfect comic timing. Highlights  were Dave Bautista as Drax and Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Paul Brittany as Vision and Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda were a lovely little port in the storm, and even Thanos, himself, has a dramatic calm. Thanos is a villain you don't agree with, but his calm self-assured martyrdom makes you think about his position more than most baddies. Infinity War can not be viewed as a stand-alone film, but for the fans the only disappointment is that you have to wait for Endgame to know how it all truly ends.
