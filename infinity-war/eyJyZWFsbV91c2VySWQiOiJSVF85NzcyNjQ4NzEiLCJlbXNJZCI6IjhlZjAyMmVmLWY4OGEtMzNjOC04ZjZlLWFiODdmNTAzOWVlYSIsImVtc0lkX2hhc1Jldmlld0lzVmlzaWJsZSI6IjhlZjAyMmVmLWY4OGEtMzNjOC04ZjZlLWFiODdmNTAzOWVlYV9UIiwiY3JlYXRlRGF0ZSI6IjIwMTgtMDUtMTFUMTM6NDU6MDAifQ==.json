It is absolutely incredible to see all of the MCU over the past decade build up to this, and it didn't disappoint. The film has almost every character, and uses them all perfectly. All characters retain their personalities and stories which is impressive since there are so many. Action is great and there is some great humor in here as well. The best part of the movie was Thanos. He is a surprisingly deep character and not your run of the mill destroy everything bad guy. Thanos has some well explained motivations and desires. I found myself understanding him. He has become my favorite MCU villain because of how great he is. The movie was tense, funny, emotional and satisfying, making quite an event that I am so happy I was able to see.","displayName":"Holden B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-11T11:40:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-11T11:45:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"977264753","realm":"RT","displayName":"Holden B","accountLink":"/user/id/977264753"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Ummmmmmmm Great!!!!!!! Of course the ending floored me but I understand MCU must go on. The show must go on. All the movies Toronto each other do I get that. It was super funny and allowed each to be themselves. It did make me dislike star lord but hey his character is suppose to be bi polar. I love seeing them all have their time in the spotlight. I think they did a great job to have do so many characters. I love Marvel and love Kevin Feige for having the \"vision\"(poor vision awww) to see the MCU working in connection with each other. Way to convince the powers that be that our ten year ride with you was worth it and we look forward to so so much more....

The film is made by the efficient, pitch-perfect character interactions; something I was expecting to be impossible with so  many.
