Since I turned 18, I've fallen in love, had the greatest of misfortune, searched for meaning in solace, forged unbreakable friendships, and came out at 28 still confused and full of wanderlust. Yet there were always guides along the way. The people I loved did their best to comfort and lead me through my hardships, and there were many others who taught me many things about my self and the world in that time. Most of them were real people, and others were only as real as my mind allowed them to be. The Avengers showed me a part of my self that I couldn't see in a mirror. Weak men seeking to help others and finding the will to do it, people fighting their inner demons and learning to control them, and others seeking to escape their past sins and finding redemption. But, the most important thing these imaginary giants, aliens, gods, geniuses, and meager humans taught me is that there is always hope. With that hope and the will to go on, I can't be defeated. I can be strong, I can be smart, I can take the loss and pain, I can fight for all of us, and so can you. We may not have any super heroes, but don't give up. We still have a world to save.","displayName":"Shane S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1123659134352704/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T22:01:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T23:26:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"974527135","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shane S","accountLink":"/user/id/974527135"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"such a great movie , they did all the characters justice . never a dull moment . won't get into it it more with out spoiling it . but watch it must watch .
