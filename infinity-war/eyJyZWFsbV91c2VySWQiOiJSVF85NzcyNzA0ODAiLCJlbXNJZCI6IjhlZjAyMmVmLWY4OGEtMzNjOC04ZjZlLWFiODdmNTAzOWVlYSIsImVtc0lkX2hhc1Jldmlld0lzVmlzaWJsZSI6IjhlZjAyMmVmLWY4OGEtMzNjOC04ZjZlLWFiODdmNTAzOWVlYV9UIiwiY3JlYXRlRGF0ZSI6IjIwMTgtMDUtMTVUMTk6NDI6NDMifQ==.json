After 18 other films building to Infinity War, it does a masterful job of coordinating all the characters and pushing each story forward.

Marvel Studios, along with The Russo Brothers have delivered a cinematic thrill ride with real stakes for the characters, a brilliant villain and some top-notch action. Avengers: Infinity War is one of the most exhilarating, emotional and satisfying cinema experiences of all-time and I can guarantee that fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe won't be left disappointed.","displayName":"Kieran M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T18:32:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T02:08:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"977270381","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kieran M","accountLink":"/user/id/977270381"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"citizen kane had a good run, but infinity war blows it away.","displayName":"Nancy B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/531920157/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T18:17:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T18:18:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"968051397","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nancy B","accountLink":"/user/id/968051397"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"this movie was so bad i had the score of Pacific Rim stuck in my head during the fight scenes. thanos, who abused gamora from childhood, \"loved\" her? i call bs","displayName":"Kora A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T18:12:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T18:13:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"977270372","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kora A","accountLink":"/user/id/977270372"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This movie was fantastic. The reason it works so well is because most of the world building and character develop was already done in previous movies. This means we do not need to waste time introducing everything and everyone. We get straight into the action and it does not stop. I loved all of our heroes' parts especially how they integrated Dr. Strange and Spiderman.\nSome of the humor was a bit much, but did not de-rail any of the scenes. I also thought some of the acting on a few characters dragged out and were overdone. Again, it did not really bother too much.","displayName":"Ako K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T18:09:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T14:57:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"977214411","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ako K","accountLink":"/user/id/977214411"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's a exceptional movie, non stop action and laughs.
