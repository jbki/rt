This Avengers movie has to be one of the best ones yet compared to the first Avengers movie released. The main reason why this movie is so good because of how amazing Josh Brolin's performance as Thanos was. He killed it!  What was surprising was the the film had good management of screen time for its many characters.","displayName":"Travis D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-18T22:20:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-18T22:29:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"977368054","realm":"RT","displayName":"Travis D","accountLink":"/user/id/977368054"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 18, 2018"}]}
