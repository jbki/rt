There were stunning action sequences that certainly lived up to their expectations and the chemistry between the characters was great. the humour was spot on, hilarious yet not disturbing the drama and emotion. Thanos was also personally the best villain yet and altogether it was just a spectacular movie to watch.","displayName":"Arthur A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T10:32:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-03T06:47:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"977269875","realm":"RT","displayName":"Arthur A","accountLink":"/user/id/977269875"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Avengers Infinity War is too long and doesn't even feel like a complete movie. Other than that, it's really very well done and exceedingly easy to follow considering the 10 years of backstory to bring us to this point. The movie really sings in the scenes between Iron Man, Spidey, Starlord, and Dr. Strange. What made the Avengers comics great makes these crossover movies great. Getting to see the interplay of heroes we've already grown to love. Dr. Strange was never my favorite stand-alone character but he excels in Dr. Strange-Ex Machina moments in comic books and here he got to do that: connect characters, give omens, drive plot hard and fast. \n\nIt's all too easy for me to look at the big numbers and think about the MCU as a cash cow, and I wouldn't be wrong exactly, but Disney is doing what it does best and shilling out for quality and risk taking, creating the most expansive cinematic universe of all time. It's never been done before and it is breathing life into stories that excel by being serialized and overlapping. These movies feel more and more like comic books and that is really cool and innovative. Can't wait for the second part that they renamed something else but for real it's a second part.","displayName":"Miles C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/836230359/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T10:13:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T10:34:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"784956482","realm":"RT","displayName":"Miles C","accountLink":"/user/id/784956482"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A great cinematic experience, leaving a lot of questions unanswered in a good way that makes you want to wait a year for the upcoming Avengers 4.","displayName":"Mateusz D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T09:46:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T09:48:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"977269822","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mateusz D","accountLink":"/user/id/977269822"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A Fuc**ng masterpiece","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/210976186352609/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T08:54:14.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T08:55:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"977269779","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977269779"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"'Avengers: Infinity War' is the culmination of most of the heroes of the Marvel cinematic universe, and it's a very good movie. Thanos is a terrifying villain which you dread seeing because you know once you see him, something bad is going to happen and there will be major consequences. Groups are split up and sent on different missions but are all for the same goal. The characters we know and love aren't really developed anymore considering they've already been developed before, but the most development comes in Thanos who for a CG character who is trying to murder half the universe, is a sympathetic character who thinks he's right. The acting is brilliant, standout being Josh Brolin as Thanos who makes the character feel real. The visual effects are mind-blowing as everything feels so real, it should feel goofy and ridiculous but it isn't. The music is decent but nothing mind-blowing the Avengers theme is a nice touch to hear often. The movie sometimes struggles in terms of cutting back and forth between many characters. It is a nitpick as it basically juggles all the characters perfectly. Expectations are subverted, all your awful theories are wrong as Marvel is very creative and utilizes it's advantage in having many movies before this one. It was worth the 10 year wait.","displayName":"David P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T08:45:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-19T11:41:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"970989789","realm":"RT","displayName":"David P","accountLink":"/user/id/970989789"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"One of the most emotional experiences i have ever had during a film, truly amazing.","displayName":"Toby A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T08:29:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T08:31:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"977269735","realm":"RT","displayName":"Toby A","accountLink":"/user/id/977269735"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"the action was there but you never saw the Hulk Thor was out of uniform Captain America you didn't even know who he was no costume you couldn't tell anybody who they were if it wasn't for the action this movie would completely suck I give it a three","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10204769525715886/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T08:07:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T08:09:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"977269714","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977269714"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Avengers : Infinity War is non-stop action packed rollercoaster from start till end , but despite this , many characters are not done justice too and given their chance to shine. With so much going on it becomes a lot to take in , but atleast does not get too messy. There was cleary no holding back by Marvel as they produced a huge number of a shocks which added to the thrills , laughter and sad moments. Overall Marvel did a pretty solid job and have set it up well for the next installment in the series.","displayName":"Emir S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T08:07:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T08:18:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977269713","realm":"RT","displayName":"Emir S","accountLink":"/user/id/977269713"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Why, Starlord?
