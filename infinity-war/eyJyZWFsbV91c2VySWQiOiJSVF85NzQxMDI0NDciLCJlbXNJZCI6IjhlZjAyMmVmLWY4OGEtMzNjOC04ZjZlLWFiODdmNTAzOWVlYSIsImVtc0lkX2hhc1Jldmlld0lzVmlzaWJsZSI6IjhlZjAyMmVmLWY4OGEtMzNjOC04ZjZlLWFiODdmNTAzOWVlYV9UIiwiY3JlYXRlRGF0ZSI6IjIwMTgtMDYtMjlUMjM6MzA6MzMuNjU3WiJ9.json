It may have Avengers in the title, but this is Thanos's film. I was really surprised at how layered and multi-dimensional he was and is the MCU's best villain. The humour was well-balanced with the more serious and emotional moments. It also has some of the best action sequences. With so many characters, there's a lot going on and the Russo brothers did a great job with the tonal shifts and transitioning between different characters and locations. Right from the beginning, this did not let up and the 2 1/2 hours were never felt. Also, be prepared for the unexpected. I don't know where I'd rank this as of now, but it's at least in my top 5 MCU films.","displayName":"Paul T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/592580135/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-29T21:31:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-29T21:31:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"784044004","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paul T","accountLink":"/user/id/784044004"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I left me raw and bereft","displayName":"Nate M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-29T21:22:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-29T21:22:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"916309997","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nate M","accountLink":"/user/id/916309997"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Finally we have\nA villain with character\nMr Stark, I don't...","displayName":"John P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-29T17:01:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-29T17:05:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"977339681","realm":"RT","displayName":"John P","accountLink":"/user/id/977339681"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"greatest film this year imo","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-29T16:36:53.067Z","updateDate":"2018-06-29T16:36:53.067Z","user":{"userId":"260029593","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260029593"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome Movie!

The movie was very engaging and it balanced humor and drama very well. Even with it's large cast of characters it manages to feel like a well fleshed out and satisfying movie.
