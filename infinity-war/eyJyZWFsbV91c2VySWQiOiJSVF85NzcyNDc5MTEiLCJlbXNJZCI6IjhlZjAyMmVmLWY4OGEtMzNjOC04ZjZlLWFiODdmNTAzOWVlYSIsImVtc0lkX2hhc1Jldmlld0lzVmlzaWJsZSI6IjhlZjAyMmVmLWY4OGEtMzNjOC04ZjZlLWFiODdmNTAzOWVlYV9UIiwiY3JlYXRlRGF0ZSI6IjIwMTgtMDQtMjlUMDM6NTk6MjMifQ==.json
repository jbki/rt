Does any one movie deserve a full 5? Well this one comes pretty darn close with me. There were very, very few things I personally would’ve changed. One being instead of vaporizing most of the heroes. Dial it back a few heroes and it would’ve sold the ending better. I cried however! Awesome! Beautiful!

Story and CGI were so spot on, no wonder why Avengers Infinity War and untitled Avengers 4 budget is around 1 Billion dollars.Thor and Thanos steals the show. Every single moment of the movie is EPIC. Definitely gonna watch it again 2-3 times more. To enjoy it fullest with amazing Surprises and SuperHero moments I recommend you to stay away from spoilers. If possible enjoy the Awesome ride in IMAX 3D only.","displayName":"Pratik G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001829745347/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T03:36:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T03:36:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"965811742","realm":"RT","displayName":"Pratik G","accountLink":"/user/id/965811742"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved the movie... can't wait to see Captain Marvel","displayName":"Inan S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/713074030/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T03:32:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T03:32:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"859805610","realm":"RT","displayName":"Inan S","accountLink":"/user/id/859805610"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I went to see the movie with so much happiness for I had waited for about a year after the first trailer had been released to see it, but I came out heartbroken.
