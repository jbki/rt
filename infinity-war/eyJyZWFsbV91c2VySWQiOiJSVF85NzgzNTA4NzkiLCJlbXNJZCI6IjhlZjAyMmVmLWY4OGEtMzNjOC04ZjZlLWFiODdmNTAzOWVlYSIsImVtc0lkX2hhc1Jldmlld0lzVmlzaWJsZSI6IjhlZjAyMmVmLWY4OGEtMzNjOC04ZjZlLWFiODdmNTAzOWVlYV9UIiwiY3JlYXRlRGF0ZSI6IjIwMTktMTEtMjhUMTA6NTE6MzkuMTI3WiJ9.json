Not in vain a movie buff Peter Parker (Spiderman) speaks of Alien, and precisely Aliens, of James Cameron, much resembles this one of Avengers. It has no respite and the battles happen, but they are so well choreographed, they follow an order and they are not mere blows and kicks: the melee fight makes sense. And the 149 minutes are spent as if it were a short film.","displayName":"Sergio P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T03:35:56.059Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T03:35:56.059Z","user":{"userId":"977789581","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sergio P","accountLink":"/user/id/977789581"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Here we are 10 years later with one of the most anticipated movies of all time!

A sequel that's over two hours immediately removes half of a star for me, no matter how good the movie is, second, I am writing this review after I watched Endgame, and, well... If you compare this to Endgame, which are both from the same series of films, The Avengers, this is pretty much a joke. Other than that, I really enjoyed this and I recommend it to everyone!
