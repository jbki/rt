It successfully gives every character a good moment and memorable line allowing everyone's favourites to be well included even through the large ensemble of cast.

The superheroes \"working together\" portion is much better done than either previous Avenger's films.\n\nAnd the villain setup as a lawfully evil psychopath with a logical motivation and understandable cause. Wow.\n\nA fantastic romp.  5/5","displayName":"Alan R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-25T08:27:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-25T08:30:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"975774825","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alan R","accountLink":"/user/id/975774825"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"While not perfect, I enjoyed this addition to the MCU.
