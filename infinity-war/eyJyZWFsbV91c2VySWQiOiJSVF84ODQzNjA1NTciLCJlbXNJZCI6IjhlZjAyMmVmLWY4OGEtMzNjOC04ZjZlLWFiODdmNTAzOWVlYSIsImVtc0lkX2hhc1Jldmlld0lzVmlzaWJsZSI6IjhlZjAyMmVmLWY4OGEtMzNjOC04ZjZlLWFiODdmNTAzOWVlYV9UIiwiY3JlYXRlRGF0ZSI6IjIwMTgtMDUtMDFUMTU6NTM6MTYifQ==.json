Excellent visual effects and score. The plot was marvelous and very smart. I will expect technical nominations. They know how to play with our feelings and emotions and crush them as glass.

If I have to criticize any part, I would say it seemed a little rushed in the 1st half. That's however understandable given all they had to cover. They still did a good job with it...and the 2nd half was outstanding.\nThe comedy was well placed, there was genuine emotion like the last scene with Peter Parker, and there were cheer-out-loud moments like Thor arriving on earth. Character interactions between avengers that had never previously met were perfectly written.  Right off the bat, Thanos was made out to be a villain that had to be taken seriously, while at the same time, given a bit of background and story arc - cough snoke cough-\nLucasfilm needs to watch this movie a dozen times and take notes. Yes, you can be different and bold while still staying true to previously established characters and movie lore to give fans a movie they like. It CAN  be done. You don't have to destroy everything that came before. Yes you can have strong female characters that are well written(Gamora, Scarlett Witch, Black Widow, etc) and given good character arcs without having to shoehorn them in.","displayName":"Gregory W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T15:46:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T16:37:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"977019626","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gregory W","accountLink":"/user/id/977019626"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"entertaining. didnt feel like 2hrs 40min. i imagine it would be confusing to somebody that didnt have a working understanding of the marvel movie mythology. usually hate cgi characters but thanos worked.

At this point in the franchises history we should all know these characters. If you don’t then you haven’t been paying attention to the past 10 years and you need to crawl back under your rock. For everyone else this movie is filled with laughs, heartbreaks and OH $%!T moments. Every scene with the Guardians feels like a Guardians movie. Every scene with The Avengers feels like an Avengers movie, but they blend so harmoniously it’s pure art. However let’s be real, this is a Thanos movie. This movie should have been titled, “Thanos.” Already got my tickets for my next day off to see this movie again.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T15:33:01.448Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T15:33:01.448Z","user":{"userId":"973836225","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/973836225"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"OMG!

I was absolutely amazed at how they were able to bring all of the characters together without the flow becoming \"clunky.\" I would recommend this movie to anyone, not just the action/comic book junkie. Also, I'd tell potential viewers to take all negative reviews with a grain of salt. There are a lot of people who just want to see the genre die out, and then there are others who always want to be the contrarian. Negative reviews are going to happen, but I find it difficult to believe that over 15% of the reviews of this film felt it was rotten.","displayName":"Jimmy N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1455668545/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T15:27:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T15:37:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"854479968","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jimmy N","accountLink":"/user/id/854479968"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Marvel Movie I’ve seen","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T15:25:41.749Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T15:25:41.749Z","user":{"userId":"260125705","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260125705"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"}]}
