People may not like this ending, including me, because no one wants the villain to win, but that doesn't mean this is a bad ending, in fact it's the main thing that sets this movie apart from other movies, when superheroes don't always win and many of them have to sacrifice for the rest of the universe. Also this movie embeds really powerful messages, so much that I may have to watch it a second time to fully get them. A truly masterpiece.\nBut if I have to name 1 thing that the movie is lack of that is the relationship between Thanos and Gamora. The  Soul stone part is pretty important in building the character Thanos, but the movie didn't show us how Gamora had become the person that Thanos loved the most. Therefore, when Thanos mourned for her in that part, it just felt so awkward to me, those tears looked so fake to me.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/856708974512961/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-04T19:17:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-04T19:39:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"977256970","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977256970"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A movie that shouldn't work, but does.

There were a few things that could have been easily avoided but in the main one I noticed was that Dr. Strange has been able to use sling rings to chop off limbs before by opening a portal putting limb through and closing the portal. So could he not have just had everyone hold thanks down while mantis was keeping him asleep and chopped off his hand. Thanks wouldn't even be able to use the gauntlet without his hand.","displayName":"Josiah S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-04T18:37:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-04T18:41:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"977256930","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josiah S","accountLink":"/user/id/977256930"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 04, 2018"}]}
