He's a compelling character and you can feel he's a real-life human (except he's not). Josh Brolin performance makes Thanos even more realistic and humane. His motion-capture performance adds up to the character of Thanos, and that's really unusual or maybe doesn't happen unless we had Andy Serkis. The CGI in general is very good. \n\nThanos has many great moving moments when he explains his motives, but despite how indirect and classy he illustrates his motivations, I hoped there were more ways to do so rather than using dialogue and nothing more. Also, I think there was no need for more explanations in the third act of the movie. C'mon, there is a final battle happens and Thanos still gives some reasons why he does that!  \n\nThere's an incredible chemistry between almost all our heroes, and that enhanced the humor in this movie which, by the way, is splendid! Almost every joke hits the mark. The problem that there was a tonal shift between the first act and the second act that made a dramatic scene not as effective as it should have been, but it's really a very minor issue as it just happened one time.\n\nThe character development features all along the movie itself not just as a complement to the previous movies.\n\nThere are a lot of shocking moments and unflinching decisions that you have never seen in a Marvel movie.\n\nI have never been confused by the story's developments or many events as all of them are represented simply. Actually even simpler than in some other MCU movies.\n\nThe Russo Brothers showed how much they understand every single character in the universe by changing the tone according to the characters and the place.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War is an epic that every MCU fan deserves. \n\n(9/10)","displayName":"Ahmed A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-03-30T07:19:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T11:02:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"976556273","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ahmed A","accountLink":"/user/id/976556273"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The First Marvel Cinematic Universe crossover...just WOW...not the best movie of MCU but how many twist.
