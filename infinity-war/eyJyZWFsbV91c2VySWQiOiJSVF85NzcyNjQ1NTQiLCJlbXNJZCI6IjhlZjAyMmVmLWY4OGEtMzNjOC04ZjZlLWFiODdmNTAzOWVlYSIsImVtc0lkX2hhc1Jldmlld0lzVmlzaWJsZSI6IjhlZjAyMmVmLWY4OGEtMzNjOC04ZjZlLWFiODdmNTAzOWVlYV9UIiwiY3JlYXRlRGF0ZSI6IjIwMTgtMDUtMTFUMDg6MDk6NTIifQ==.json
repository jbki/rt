But my predominant thought leaving the theater was wondering who the hell could possibly follow the film's dizzying two-and-a-half hour story arc ... much less all the individual Marvel story arcs that preceded it, considering 'Infinity War' is the culmination of 18 different superhero movies. \n\nI recognized most of the actors (and most of their characters).  But when you have three or four (?) different groups of heroes fighting three or four (?) different groups of baddies on three or four (?) different planets the film quickly turns into an all-you-can-eat buffet of action that, while still very appetizing, is quite a different experience than that of a neatly composed--and somewhat moderately portioned--meal.","displayName":"Metaflix I","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-11T07:13:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-11T07:13:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"975854408","realm":"RT","displayName":"Metaflix I","accountLink":"/user/id/975854408"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie that balances all the heroes and main villain for the most part.

I love the original Avengers characters and I couldn't believe how little screen time Captain America and especially Bucky Barnes had in Infinity War. There wasn't a single conversation between them.  It felt like the Spider Man, Iron Man, Guardians and Thor show.  Falcon and Black Widow also had minimal screen time.  I found it strange to build such a connection to these characters and their friendships over many films, and to then sideline them.  For me it meant the film lacked heart and an emotional connection.  Hopefully this changes in the final film.","displayName":"Nic S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-11T05:50:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-12T20:26:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"977264420","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nic S","accountLink":"/user/id/977264420"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Heart broken.
