Great superhero team-up action and humor. Thought everyone did a great job. The interaction between the Guardians and Thor was fantastic, as well as Iron-Man and Doctor Strange. Great finally seeing some of my favorite MCU characters all together in place, Thor, Captain America, Black Panther, Spider-Man, etc... If only the Fantastic Four could of been there too. Thanos and the Black Order also made for excellent villains. I do prefer the motivations of Thanos from the comics, more mad Titian to me, but I understand why they did what they did. I can't wait till next year for the conclusion.","displayName":"Scott K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10204567023136108/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-04T14:34:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-29T19:56:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"973887170","realm":"RT","displayName":"Scott K","accountLink":"/user/id/973887170"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"PERFECT, as all MCU should be!","displayName":"bbcversus B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-04T14:32:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-04T14:32:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"977096563","realm":"RT","displayName":"bbcversus B","accountLink":"/user/id/977096563"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I’d rate it higher if I didn’t have to spend more money to resolve literally anything.
