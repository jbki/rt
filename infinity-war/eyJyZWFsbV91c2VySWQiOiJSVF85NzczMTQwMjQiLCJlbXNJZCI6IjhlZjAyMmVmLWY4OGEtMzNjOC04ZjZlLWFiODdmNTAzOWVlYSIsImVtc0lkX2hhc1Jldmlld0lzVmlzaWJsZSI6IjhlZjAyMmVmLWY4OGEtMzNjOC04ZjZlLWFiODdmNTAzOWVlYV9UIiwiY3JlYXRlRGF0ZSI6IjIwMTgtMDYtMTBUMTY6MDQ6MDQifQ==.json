There were moments of humor and sadness. HOWEVER, there was no storyline whatsoever. It was one action/fight scene piled on top of another with no arc or purpose. 1.) bad guy 2.) two separate teams of good guys 3.) lots of flashy computer generated graphics I was really hoping for more of a story to make me care about the characters. I cared about the heroes only because I was familiar with them from previous movies. Someone got lazy by not making a movie that has a true beginning, middle and end.
