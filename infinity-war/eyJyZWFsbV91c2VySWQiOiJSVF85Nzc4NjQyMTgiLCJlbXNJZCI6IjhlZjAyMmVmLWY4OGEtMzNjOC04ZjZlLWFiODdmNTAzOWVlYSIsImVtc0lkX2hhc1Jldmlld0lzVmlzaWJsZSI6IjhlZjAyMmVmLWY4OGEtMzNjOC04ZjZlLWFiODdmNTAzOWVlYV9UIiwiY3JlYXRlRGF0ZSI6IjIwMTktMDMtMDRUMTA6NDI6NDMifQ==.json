And the latter would say âI couldnâ(TM)t even run that fast like that guy.â? He would help his sister, Vision, Black Widow and Cap fight Corvus Glaive and Proxima Midnight by dodging Proxmia's attacks and attempting to destabilize Glaive, only to be hit by his glaive right before being impaled in the back by Black Widow. By this time, he would be capable of reaching supersonic speeds between Mach 4 and Mach 5. He would also outrun everyone else again, passing like a blur and create 3 duplicates of himself to help kill some of the Outriders during the Battle of Wakanda, surprised how big Wakanda is, even calling it similar to Narnia. Later, he would help Cap escort Wanda and Vision to a safe place, admitting even with his speed becoming more powerful as he becomes older, \"The big purple alien\" would not stay down and try to attack Thanos, but he would freeze the speedster and beat him down, being surprised how fast a human can be and senses he has the potential for limitless speed.  Not to mention, like Wanda, he would also lose his accent and be erased during the snap alongside his sister, his last words being âWell, I never saw that coming.â? I created a petition to bring him back to the land of the living.
