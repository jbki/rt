Why is Thanos' wiping out half the universe so that people don't go hungry? The destruction of half the universe was to show off to and court Death. I feel like they should have stuck with that from the comics. Otherwise, a very good superhero movie with the amount they put into it.","displayName":"Harrison P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-18T17:36:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-18T17:43:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"976290971","realm":"RT","displayName":"Harrison P","accountLink":"/user/id/976290971"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A fun movie.
