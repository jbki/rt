So first off there's absolutely no waiting in this film. You get thrown into the action immediately and stay there until the movie's over. It feels kind of strange calling this an Avengers movie when this is no question Thanos' story and what a great one it is! I've heard many people say that the most terrifying villain is the one who thinks he's doing something righteous. Thanos very eloquently falls in this category. He is so well spoken and well developed that it's almost hard to root against him! Thanos is a magnificent villain. The best Marvel villain by far,  but come on its not on the same level as Heath Ledger's Joker. Why? One Ledger isn't mostly CGI the whole film, two Thanos wants to save the universe where the Joker just wanted to watch the world burn. They don't compare so stop saying Thanos is the greatest ever. He's good but no where near Ledger good. About the Avengers, yes they are in it too and surprisingly and so well done by writers/directors the Russo Brothers, every major character gets a good moment on the screen. Yes the film is very busy. One may say too busy as it flies from story line to story line. This movie does not let you catch your breath. It is extremely well done and I don't think anyone will be expecting what happens. It really is one of the greatest comic book movies ever. There's laughter (and it's not overdone like in Thor:.Ragnorak), suspense and sadness. This although a prequel is an entire movie. That will leave you aghast yet smiling. Wonderful screen play. There's really not a lot to complain about here. There are parts here and there that I thought were silly. But the good outweighs the bad so much it's hard to even remember the bad. I went in with high expectations and was not disappointed at all. Go. See. This. Movie.  In my opinion it is the second best Marvel film yet behind Captain America: Civil War. And that is phenomenal praise from me. I do think it's a little hard for a PG-13 but good luck telling your kid that. This is a solid 9/10.","displayName":"Andy G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/5204487/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T23:22:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T23:23:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"803868927","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andy G","accountLink":"/user/id/803868927"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"After Infinity War, the only way Marvel are getting money out of me is with the Xmen universe. Way to go to completely and utterly piss off your loyal fan base. 8/10 for the first 2 hours and minus 20/10 for the last half hour. Wish someone had told me to leave 2 hours in and remain oblivious.
