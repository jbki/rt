But there are big fundamental problems and as a general fan of these films, I have to admit that both Captain America: Winter Soldier and Spider-Man: Homecoming are better crafted and more cohesive stories than this. For me it's most fatal flaw (and I'll stay spoiiler free here) is that it left me feeling like the consequences of it's climax were weightless and hollow and left me with less interest in it's inevitable sequel, when typically the goal is the very opposite.","displayName":"Simon P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T02:40:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T02:47:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"906763297","realm":"RT","displayName":"Simon P","accountLink":"/user/id/906763297"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great the movie was good need I say more ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T02:39:26.663Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T02:39:26.663Z","user":{"userId":"966220627","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/966220627"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Below Average movie!!!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1768300236567172/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T02:37:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T02:39:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250296","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977250296"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Let me just say it's a pleasant movie going experience but it's not even close to the best movie ever hype going around.
