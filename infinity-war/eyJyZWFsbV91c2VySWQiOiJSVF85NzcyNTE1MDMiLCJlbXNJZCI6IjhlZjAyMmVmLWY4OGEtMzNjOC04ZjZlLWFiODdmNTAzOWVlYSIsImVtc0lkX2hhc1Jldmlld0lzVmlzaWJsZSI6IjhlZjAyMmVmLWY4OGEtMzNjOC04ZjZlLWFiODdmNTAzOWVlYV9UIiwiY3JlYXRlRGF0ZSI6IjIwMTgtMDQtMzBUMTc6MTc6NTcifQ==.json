The film started with a strong and well paced opening, then quickly disintegrated into awkwardly placed one liners and formulaic fight sequences. The storyline followed the previous avengers films formula with a few seperately events ultimately culminating with a couple waves of grunts and one final last stand. The \"risky\" ending was an attempt made by the Russo brothers to land in the high ranks of The Empire Strikes Back or The Last Jedi, and where those films managed to connect real human emotion, fear, and hopelessness, Infinity War simply parlayed the archetypal romance and father/son motifs into an ending that will almost certainly be reversed in the next 2 hour and 40 minute Avengers film. The film should have boasted a Pt. 1 moniker, but I'm sure after screentesting they figured that title wouldn't garner the best approval ratings or box office numbers. In my view, you could almost entirely skip this \"opening act\" of a film and watch the next one feeling fully satisfied. At least that way the ending of this film will shock you in the first 5 minutes of Infinity War Pt. 2, instead of guaranteeing that you see it coming from the second we see what Thanos is capable of at the start of the film.","displayName":"Gray G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T17:06:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T17:19:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"946062575","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gray G","accountLink":"/user/id/946062575"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Holy crap what a movie Best one yet Canâ€™t wait for part 2 CAPTAIN MARVEL!

Naturally, there are going to be a few cracks in it, and it's easier to talk about why it isn't perfect. Something that bothered me while viewing it was that some subplots were Loren interesting than others and that the transitions to interesting to not so interesting were kinda bothersome. I'd honestly would've much rathered seen more Thanos than a lame (nearly) pointless Teenage Groot. And there was a pretty odd inconsistency with Thanos as far as his power goes. He kicks ass in the first ten minutes of the movie but later on struggles against not even the most powerful superhero in the franchise. Other than that, at least for me, it was fantastic. Josh Brolin snatches the spotlight as Thanos every second he's on screen, and I remain in awe at the fact they managed to make him relatable in a way, and somewhat justify his sinister goals. And there's very impressive performances from everyone else on the cast . Coupled with Disney budget special effects, trusted and talented directors, and an ending so huge it could rival that of The Empire Strikes Back, it's a wonderful and emotional heart attack of a film worth seeing, especially for diehard fans of the comics or films.","displayName":"Grant J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T16:51:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T17:07:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"977251472","realm":"RT","displayName":"Grant J","accountLink":"/user/id/977251472"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"the ending really pissed me off ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T16:51:01.257Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T16:51:01.257Z","user":{"userId":"937983319","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/937983319"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Thrilling.
