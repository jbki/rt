Thanos is probably the best villain the MCU has ever seen. Some characters are left behind in the film (Cap, Black Panther, Rocket etc.) But given the number of characters it successfully juggles, it is a big achievement. Massive credit has to go to the writers (Marcus and McFreely) as well as the Russos.","displayName":"Allan R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-08T00:52:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-08T00:56:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"977399546","realm":"RT","displayName":"Allan R","accountLink":"/user/id/977399546"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Why?!

First off, the film has numerous plot holes and moments of pure stupidity.
