The film does the unexpected a lot so plan on anything happening. The movie is over 2 and a half hours but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace.

As a consequence of having so many characters, there really weren't any character arcs and there wasn't much development for anyone but Thanos. It felt like a mashup of action sequences, some that didn't fit together smoothly, but I think that the directors did the best they could with this huge project. They also paired up characters who would have good chemistry with one another or who would create amusing conflict, which I thought was clever. As usual, the action sequences were excellent and well choreographed. There were some romances which were previously undeveloped and felt very last-minute. If you're a Bruce Banner fan you'll be happy with the generous screen time he's given here; same for Scarlet Witch fans. I think that the villain was also a success; Thanos seemed more reasonable than most antagonists and was very well set up. I was very happy with that end credits sequence and I wish I could spoil it for you but that's not what I do. If you're a Marvel fan, I'd definitely recommend Infinity War. Just know that lots of people \"die\" in this movie, so don't say I didn't warn you (I'm sure they'll be back, it is a comic book movie).","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/714751235535339/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-08T17:09:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-08T17:09:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977464290","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977464290"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie I have ever seen after the dark Knight...","displayName":"Francesco A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/242109476202645/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-08T16:07:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-08T16:08:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"975755506","realm":"RT","displayName":"Francesco A","accountLink":"/user/id/975755506"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Absolutely fantastic!

I still like the whole in love with Death thing better, and it's a bit confusing that Thanos goes from caring about a little girl fighting for her life to sending her to fight to the death at some point later on. Knowing the release schedule of future films really undercuts the weight of the ending too; it's already clear who's going to be back by the end of Avengers 4. But this is the first movie ever to completely capture the feel of an event comic. The Guardians running into Thor, Wong meeting Stark, Spidey on a spaceship, these are the kinds of things that you can usually only see in comics. What an amazing universe Marvel has created, despite all the superhero fatigue, it never ceases to amaze me. I just want to go back in time to 2006 to show little Adam writing a biography about Stan Lee everything that these movies would be able to pull off.","displayName":"Adam M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-07T19:31:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-07T19:31:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"901316689","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adam M","accountLink":"/user/id/901316689"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Definitely well worth the wait.
