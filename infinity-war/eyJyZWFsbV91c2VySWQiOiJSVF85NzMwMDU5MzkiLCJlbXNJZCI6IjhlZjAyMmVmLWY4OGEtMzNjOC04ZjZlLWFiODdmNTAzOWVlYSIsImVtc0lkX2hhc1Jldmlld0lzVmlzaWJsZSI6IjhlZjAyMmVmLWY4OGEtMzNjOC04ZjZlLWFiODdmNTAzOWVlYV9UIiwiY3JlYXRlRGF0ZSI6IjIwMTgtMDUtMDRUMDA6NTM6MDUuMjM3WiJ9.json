This is by far the best Avengers film to date and the best Marvel to movie adaptation I've witnessed. Why not 5 stars? There are a few glaring things I find wrong with the portrayal of our superheroes. First of all, as always, Black Widow is way overpowered. On the other hand, she's not featured as much in this film (just given little scenes here and there). Vision is WAY underutilized. He's just a pawn in these films, and his abilities are not utilized at all. Scarlet Witch is not featured as much as she could've been. The Hulk is afraid??? Kind of ridiculous and convenient (like how he never faced Hela in Ragnarok). Captain America is featured a tad less than you'd think he would be (and so is Bucky). Black Panther has some cool scenes in Wakanda, and honestly, the Wakanda scenes are better in this film than in Black Panther. Beyond that, there is one scene that bugs me... It's when the Avengers have Thanos restrained and they're trying to take the Infinity Gauntlet off of his hand.... Why don't they stab him and kill him then??? There's a scene where Gamora kills Thanos (but only a simulated Thanos) by stabbing him in the neck. It seems so odd that they would have that scene in there and then have Thanos subdued and not attempt something similar. Those are literally the only things that bug me about this film. Other than that, it's simply amazing.","displayName":"Ben H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T23:55:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-04T00:05:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"954116903","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ben H","accountLink":"/user/id/954116903"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Crazy movie.
