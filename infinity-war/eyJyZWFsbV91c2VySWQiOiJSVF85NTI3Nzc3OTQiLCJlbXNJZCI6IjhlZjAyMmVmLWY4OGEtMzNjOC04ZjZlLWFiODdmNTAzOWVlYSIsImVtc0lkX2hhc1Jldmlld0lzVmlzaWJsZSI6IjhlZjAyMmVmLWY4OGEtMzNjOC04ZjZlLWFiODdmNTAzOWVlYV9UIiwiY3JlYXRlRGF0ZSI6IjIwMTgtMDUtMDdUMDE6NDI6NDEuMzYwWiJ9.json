It had really awe-inspiring special effects, really great characters, lots of great humor, really awesome action, really exciting adventure, really superb cast, really awesome music, really great cinematography, really well done costumes, really great makeup and a really cool storyline. In my opinion, I think it’s the best Avengers movie of the year. I’ll have to see what’s happening in the fourth part of “The Avengers” next year. I really recommend this movie to old and new Marvel fans of all ages.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T01:22:55.557Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T01:22:55.557Z","user":{"userId":"909943338","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/909943338"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Love love love it!

I enjoyed the first part of this movie. There were many small battles involving a few heroes each time. The character Thanos was greatly expanded. The second part of this movie was almost boring. Just like the other two Avengers movies, the climactic battle relies on countless hordes of generic enemies attacking the heroes. And just like the other two movies, the generic hordes all die when a hero flips a switch (this time it's Thor). This is lazy script writing and I'm tired of it. I'm hoping the second part of Infinty War does not use this lazy plot device. The ending of this movie leaves much to be desired. The ending is full of death and despair. I understand the second movie will be happier. This reminds me of the disaster known as The Last Jedi.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T00:31:06.752Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T00:32:02.360Z","user":{"userId":"260128725","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260128725"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"very good movie blending everyone together.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T00:20:21.854Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T00:20:21.854Z","user":{"userId":"901191695","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/901191695"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Seeing all the characters and superheroes from different stories fighting together for the same cause was the highlight for me; especially the characters from Guardians of the Galaxy and Black Panther.
