I enjoyed it, but nothing is explained properly. Let's use Dragonball as an example, they have power scaling and this helps explain why opponent A, can't leave a scratch on opponent B, because there is a massive difference in power levels. In the MCU (movies) they haven't clearly defined who is stronger than who, so when Thanos comes along and just trounces everyone, I still don't know why he's so strong, because he's an alien? If he didn't have the glove, would he still be formidable?? I know these are all explained in the comics, but they can't assume all moviegoers know that stuff.\nIt was an okay movie and I'm looking forward to the next part, but let's hope it's got more substance and not just action packed muscled/robot/CGI dudes fighting.\nPet Peeve - there is a part where a certain hero can see the future and all possible outcomes... Yet can't see into the literal immediate future, when a hero does something stupid, which could have prevented this whole \"war\".","displayName":"Aaron K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/593570727/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T10:05:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T10:24:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"805041501","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aaron K","accountLink":"/user/id/805041501"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing.
