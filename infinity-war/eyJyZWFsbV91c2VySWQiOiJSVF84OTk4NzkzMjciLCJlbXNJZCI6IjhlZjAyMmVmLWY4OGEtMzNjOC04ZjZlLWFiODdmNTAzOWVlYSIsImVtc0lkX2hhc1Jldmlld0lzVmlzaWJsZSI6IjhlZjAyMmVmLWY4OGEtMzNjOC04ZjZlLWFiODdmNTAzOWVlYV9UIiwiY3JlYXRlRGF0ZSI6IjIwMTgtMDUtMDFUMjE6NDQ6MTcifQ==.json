So, I am not a fan of Marvel movies. I have a lot of compliments on them. Even the best ones prior to this one is a meh. That being said, I can still feel the personality of every character in this movie. This is accomplished mostly by humor. Every character gets funny and somewhat clever lines. Although, they don't advance the plot like a satire. Marvel movies often over rely on the personalities of the main characters, and by the end of each film, they often grow stale because sometimes they don't change. Avengers infinity wars does over rely on personally, but because they are so many characters, when things are about to get stale, the movie movie moves on to a different character. You can think about it like the best parts of a Marvel movie are all wrap in to this one. The music, sound effects, and visual effects are just amazing. I had my eyes glued to the screen every second. This is main reason to watch this movie. The eye and sound candy. It makes all action scenes, which are already great in themselves, a piece of art. The biggest problem with the movie is the villains. Thanos is charismatic evil guy that wants power, but he is nothing more then that. The movie tries to humanize him, but he's ideology is the bubonic pledge, so it really hard to symbolize with him. He sees a problem with the world, but the audience isn't shown the issue. If there was just one scene of overpopulation, then it would work. As of his henchmen and henchwoman. There are just ev guys making evil faces. Though, you can argue that there character is shown by action and each of their personalities are distinct, but that's not enough for a good villain. This is still over relays on personality meaning that you don't get much in terms of back story. In Love Simon, every character has at least three lines that give a background that is so reliable. I don't that here, and it not like it's impossible. DC comics and animated films are masters of this skill. Overall I think this film is a must watch for every move goer.

So much stuff here.  I will keep everything to a general nature.\nThis is a ensemble of Marvel characters, both good and bad. Amazing to see the multi-protagonist story structure done this deftly. George Lucas is a master at it, and well, it appears that the director here attempted to emulate him....it is a workable effort. The first act is re-introducing us to characters we all know (with a great entry by Captain America). The second act does the best it can, slipping into formulaic action and one-liners. But there is reprieve! The third act delivers a multi-layered, thought-out ending coupled with an awesome post credits easter egg scene that leads into the next film. So please folks, catch that last scene.  *Just as a helpful FYI - as soon as the credits roll, there is enough time to visit the lavatory and return to view the final scene...about 5 minutes, I'd say.\nIt is a long film, be mindful of that. There is much violence also, parents be advised. \nMy overall impression that this film succeeds at connecting the dots (albeit we all can see what it was without the dots being connected).  It is rather predictable. Some scenes, either overtly or subtly, are telegraphed to us. I am not sure if this was deliberate or desperate. You be the judge.","displayName":"Lawrence C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T21:22:14.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T15:04:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"976389874","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lawrence C","accountLink":"/user/id/976389874"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great movie.
