Mind blowing. Shocking. Hilarious. Visual Masterpiece. Bizzare. Different. And last , one of the best from Marvel. They just nailed this one. I was left speechless after I saw the film, or I would say a cinematic event. Joe and Anthony made every effort to make this one completely different from what we've seen earlier in Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has got some really hilarious jokes , and for sure they are going to give you a laugh. At times it does gets serious , and the gravity of the situation can be genuinely felt, but the trio: Rocket , Groot , Thor, are there at our dispense. The ending is sure to give you a shock, but after the post credit scene, everyone is going to get really excited for the next part. One last thing- don't miss this one at any cost. #learnDC","displayName":"Shikhar S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T21:51:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T22:01:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"977244552","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shikhar S","accountLink":"/user/id/977244552"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Third time's a charm.

That was a great emotional(very emotional), thrilling ride. I think my favourite superhero pair up is rocket and Bucky.... or Rocket and Thor.... there are so many great moments between all these superhero characters that we have gotten to know over the last 10 years. The movie flew by that it definitely did not feel like it was a 2 hour 40 min movie. There are so many things that you don't see coming and it makes the movie all the better.
