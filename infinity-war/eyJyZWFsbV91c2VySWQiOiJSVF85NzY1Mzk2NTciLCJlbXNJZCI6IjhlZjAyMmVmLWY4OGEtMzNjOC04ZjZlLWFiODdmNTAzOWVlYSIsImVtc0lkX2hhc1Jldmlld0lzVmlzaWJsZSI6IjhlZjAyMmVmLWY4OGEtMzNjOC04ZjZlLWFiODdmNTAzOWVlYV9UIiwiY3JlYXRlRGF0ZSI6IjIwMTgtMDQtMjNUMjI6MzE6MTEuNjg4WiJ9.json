The best part of the movie was Thanks and he was the bad guy. Don't get me started on what marvel has done to Spiderman because it makes me I'll. I'm sure it's going to make a trillion dollars but I can honestly say Batman V Superman and Justice League we're better then Infiniti war. The movie is basically a big action piece. Then lots of talking. Then another action piece, rinse and repeat. And...spoiler alert.........it is never explained why Bruce can't become the hulk after the first action piece to open the movie. Thor Ragnarok and Winter Soldier are still the best Marvel movies by a wide margin.
