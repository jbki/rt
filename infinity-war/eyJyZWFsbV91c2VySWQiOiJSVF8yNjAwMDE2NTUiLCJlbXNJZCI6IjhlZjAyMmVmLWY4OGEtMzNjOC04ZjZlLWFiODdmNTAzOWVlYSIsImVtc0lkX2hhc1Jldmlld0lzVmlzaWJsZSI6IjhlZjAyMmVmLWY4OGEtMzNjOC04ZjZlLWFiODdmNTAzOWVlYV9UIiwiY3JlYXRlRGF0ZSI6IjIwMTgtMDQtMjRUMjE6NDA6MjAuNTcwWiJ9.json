Infinity War is truly epic and will become a fan favourite forever. Despite being somewhat bloated which was on my concerns going into this movie. However, there are a lot of elements that work in this movie such as the humour(somewhat wasn't expecting it to be lighthearted because THANOS!), the dramatic scenes hit me unexpectedly and in most of them I felt really invested in and most of all the villain, he was so developed, well crafted and his purpose portrayed perfectly(MARVEL VILLAIN PROBLEM SOLVED). I will not say much about the action scenes because you will gasp and awe at the cinematic mind blowing scene after scene of the most incredible shots ever put to film. To sum it all up, this movie does have it flaws in being bloated but it worth watching over and over again, you will not be bored, you will overlook these flaws and you will enjoy this movie for what it is: a made for fans but also has heart and beauty DC CEOS PLEASE NOTE THAT!","displayName":"Jay K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T21:15:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T15:38:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"977236557","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jay K","accountLink":"/user/id/977236557"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great, Great,Great Job. all together at least.
