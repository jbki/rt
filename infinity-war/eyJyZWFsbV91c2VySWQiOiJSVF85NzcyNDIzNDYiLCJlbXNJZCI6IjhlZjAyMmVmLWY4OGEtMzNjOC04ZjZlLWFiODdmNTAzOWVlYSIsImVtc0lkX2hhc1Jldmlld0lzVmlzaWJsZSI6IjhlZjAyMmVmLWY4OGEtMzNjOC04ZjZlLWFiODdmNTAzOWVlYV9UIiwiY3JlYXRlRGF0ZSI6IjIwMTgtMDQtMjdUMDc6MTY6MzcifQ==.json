I have stood in line for 10 years to ride this ride and I will ride it again.  love the way the movie did not follow the comic and did its own thing.  (much like walking dead on Amc)  \nActing/setting: This is a very dark, emotional Marvel Movie. It has to be. each star had their opportunity to shine.  writing was easy to follow, witty and left very few \"holes of wonder\".  I appreciated the locations the director took us... From Space (you will understand when you see it) to the jungle of the battle scene.\nPhotography - special effects were great in 3D.  Worth the extra $$.  3d was not cheese, rather light and enjoyable.  did not make me dizzy from too much motion.  Color and shadows were good and most of the time felt real.  Enjoyed the overall \"sight\" of the film \nSound and soundtrack were great.  Sound effects was what I expected.  The fight scene was almost at a level of Lord of the Ring (return of the king version).  While space \"things\" had sound to give audiences a feel of \"getting it done\".  Soundtrack built up the scenes and you can hear the audience clap when the avengers' theme blared overhead.  The soundtrack did not over power the scenes and helped move the setup over and over.\nWhat I would have liked to see...  Black Panther on Sale in 4K prior to the Movie release.  Why?  So- during my MCU marathon I would be ready for anything.\nWatch again?\nRentability - A+\nTo Buy - A+.  This one I will get in 4K.\nDid wife fall asleep?  - no!\nI rank this movie as a Full Beer Stein.","displayName":"Allen W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T07:13:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T08:09:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"977242340","realm":"RT","displayName":"Allen W","accountLink":"/user/id/977242340"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A must see for all Marvel fans, an excellent movie with its fair share of action, homour and tragic moments.
