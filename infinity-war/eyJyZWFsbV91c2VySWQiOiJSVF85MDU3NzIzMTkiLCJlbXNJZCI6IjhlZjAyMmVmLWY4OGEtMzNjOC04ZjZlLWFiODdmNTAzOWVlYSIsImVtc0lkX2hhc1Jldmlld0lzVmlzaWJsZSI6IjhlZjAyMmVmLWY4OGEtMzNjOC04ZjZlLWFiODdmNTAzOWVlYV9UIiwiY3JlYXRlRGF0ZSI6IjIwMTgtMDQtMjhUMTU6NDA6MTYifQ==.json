The acting was superb! A wonderful combination of all of our favorite heroes... wrapped up in an exceedingly dismal, hopeless, and depressing storyline that is riddled with plot holes so wide Thanos' planet Titan could be rolled through them like a ball. The absurdity of Infinity War's plot is unbelievable even in a world where we already accept the existence of beings with super human strength, abilities, and advanced weapons technology. What's worse is the obvious and cheap plot conveniences setup in this movie that will allow escape routes in future installments once they realize how poorly conceived the writing of this installment was.","displayName":"Trent H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1143390027/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T15:37:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T15:46:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"792247104","realm":"RT","displayName":"Trent H","accountLink":"/user/id/792247104"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"As it turns out, Josh Brolin was an excellent choice.  Thanos stole the show. Thanos' character development was important and I wasn't sure how they would make it work. They made it work.  I have to let this sink in before I decide how it compares to the rest of the series' but it's fair to say this is in the top 3.","displayName":"Cracko K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T15:33:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T15:41:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"906508692","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cracko K","accountLink":"/user/id/906508692"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely loved it!
