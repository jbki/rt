The film is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. \nThis is the first of the modern superhero movies that I have actually enjoyed, The humorous edge was present throughout, and there were often so many quick one-liners that I missed some of them. This was also partly due to the dialogue, which was too soft. Although there were some slight similarities with Star Wars end even Harry Potter, what surprised me most was the depth of the narrative, especially towards the end. And the unexpected ending certainly left me wondering. Now I look forward to the sequel.\nThe highest grossing film of 2018.","displayName":"Mike V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-11-12T16:28:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-20T01:21:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"950916199","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike V","accountLink":"/user/id/950916199"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"BEST MOVIE OF 2018!!!","displayName":"Ryan L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-11-12T16:01:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-11-12T16:03:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"977607705","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan L","accountLink":"/user/id/977607705"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"dark, depressing, ambiguous","displayName":"Carl B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-11-12T07:32:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-11-12T07:32:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"977354955","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carl B","accountLink":"/user/id/977354955"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo soooooooooooooooo good!!!!!!","displayName":"Josiah P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-11-12T04:44:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-11-12T04:45:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"977603372","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josiah P","accountLink":"/user/id/977603372"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie, kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and has a surprising ending.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2157529807899280/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-11-10T20:02:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-11-10T20:03:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"977604648","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977604648"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great characters, and the ability to construct a movie where they all fit in is very impressive.","displayName":"Dwight L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-11-10T10:26:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-11-10T10:32:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"976161523","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dwight L","accountLink":"/user/id/976161523"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"To be honest, i am disappointed. I was so curious about seing this movie. I even went in the Premiere of it and after it i was like, yeah that was not that i expected. DidnÂ´t have the Wow-Factor i had in previous Marvel-Movies. They built this whole universe with more than 15 movies, which all introduce the Infinity Stones etc. and then they put the Soul Stone on a random Planet. Why?! For me this was one of the biggest Disappointings in the MCU.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2257864331163416/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-11-10T09:47:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-11-10T09:50:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"977603512","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977603512"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was very exceptional, very beautiful and vividly directed and orchestrated with good music and cinematography.
