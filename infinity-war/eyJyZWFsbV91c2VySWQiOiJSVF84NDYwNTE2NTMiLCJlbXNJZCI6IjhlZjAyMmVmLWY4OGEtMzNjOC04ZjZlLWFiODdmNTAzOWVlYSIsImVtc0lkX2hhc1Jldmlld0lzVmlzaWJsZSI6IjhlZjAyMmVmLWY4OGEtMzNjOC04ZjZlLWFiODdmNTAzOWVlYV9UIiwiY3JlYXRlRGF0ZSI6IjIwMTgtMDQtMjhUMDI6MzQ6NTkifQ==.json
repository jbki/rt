By talking the bold step of making the antagonist central to the film - very clever and by being strong enough not to have the atypical fairytale ending - again kudos! No matter what (slim) advantage our heroes could concoct the sense of inevitability remained.\nEven if you think you know the outcome, you'll still be gobsmacked when you watch it. I was so stunned by the extent of the beatdown handed to our heroes, that I left the cinema at 01:30 AM - stunned. I walked home - still stunned. I got in and laid face-first on my bed for some 30-40 min - still stunned. And here I am at 10:45 AM on Saturday, still processing... What an entertaining ride!! \nMost definitely will be going to see again but on IMAX.","displayName":"Patrick%20 J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T02:28:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T02:45:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245092","realm":"RT","displayName":"Patrick%20 J","accountLink":"/user/id/977245092"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Everyone but a few “die” even though multiple more films with the characters that “died” are planned.
