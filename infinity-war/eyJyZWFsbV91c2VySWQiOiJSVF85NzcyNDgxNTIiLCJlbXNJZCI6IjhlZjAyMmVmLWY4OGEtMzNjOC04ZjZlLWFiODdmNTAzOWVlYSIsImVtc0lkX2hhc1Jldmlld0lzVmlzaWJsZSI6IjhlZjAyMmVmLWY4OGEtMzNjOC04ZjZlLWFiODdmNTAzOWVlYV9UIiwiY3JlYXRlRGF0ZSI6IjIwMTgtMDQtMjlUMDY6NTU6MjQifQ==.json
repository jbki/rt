I'm only going to go over items that will not spoil. Too much going on so it felt rushed and almost like a commercial for the MCU. Loyal comic readers pretty much know what's up however Marvel may have done a disservice to those not familiar with the infinity gauntlet saga by releasing the schedule of future movies so far in advance and so far into the future. Lastly, can we agree that the Thanos CGI was just plain bad? I knocked some of JLs scenes for being bad but Thanos walking the steps to his thrown looked like it was shot with 90s tech.","displayName":"Brandon M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T06:52:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T07:04:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"977221470","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brandon M","accountLink":"/user/id/977221470"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Just as exciting as the first Avengers movie, only with a way bigger scope - a rollercoaster of non-stop action of epix proportions.
