In some respects It's one of the best action movies I've ever seen. Unlike most superhero films it managed to give true stakes and costs, while balancing a huge cast in an interesting and convincing way. Seeing some reactions already though, I almost feel like it's going to have a mild \"Last Jedi\" effect where people are upset 'cause they didn't see exactly what they wanted. It was the first time in the MCU where I had a bit of a \"Game of Thrones\" feeling, and that sense of surprise and doubt was exciting.","displayName":"Martin C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1323452952/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T02:34:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T02:40:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"846051653","realm":"RT","displayName":"Martin C","accountLink":"/user/id/846051653"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
