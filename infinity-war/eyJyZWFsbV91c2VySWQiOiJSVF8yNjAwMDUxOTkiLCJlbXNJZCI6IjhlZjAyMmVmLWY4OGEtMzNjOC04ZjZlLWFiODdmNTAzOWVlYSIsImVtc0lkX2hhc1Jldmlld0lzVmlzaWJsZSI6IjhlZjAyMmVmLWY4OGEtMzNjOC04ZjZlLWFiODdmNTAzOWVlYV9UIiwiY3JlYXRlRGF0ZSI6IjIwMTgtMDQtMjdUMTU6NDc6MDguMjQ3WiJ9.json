The creativity behind this film is phenomenal and rightly out of this world. Josh Brolin as Thanos, my personal opinion is the best bad guy we had in cinema, you get a good emotional connection with a giant purple ballsack chin epic beast fulfilling his dest infinity it collecting infinty stones... What a storyline.... there has been so many avenger films now you know all the actors and characters in quite a lot of depth and produces quality. Didn't want to blink it was that good.","displayName":"Scott G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T15:43:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T15:55:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243660","realm":"RT","displayName":"Scott G","accountLink":"/user/id/977243660"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"No spoilers here.

The story line is good but fragmented.  It seems that the producers tried to tie 2-3 additional movies into this one and I believe they failed. Due to a greater amount of profanity I would NOT recommend it for anyone under 12. The new characters are excellent yet I find some second tier actors are better than first tier. In chatting with our family we all agreed that the ending didn't make any sense. Due to that and the fractured story line I give this 2 stars.","displayName":"Ralph R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T15:40:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T15:47:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"977061813","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ralph R","accountLink":"/user/id/977061813"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best marvel movie ever one of the best movies period ever ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T15:39:05.022Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T15:39:05.022Z","user":{"userId":"260108457","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260108457"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was the best Marvel MCU movie in my opinion. Absolutely NO movie is perfect and if you want to squint and be ultra critical then you can dwell on those imperfections or things you didn't quite like. The film kept the action going from beginning to end. I enjoyed the portrayal of Thanos as more than a power hungry CG giant. I tend to be critical but this one was truly a masterpiece and will leave everyone wanting more. The critics score of 85 is VERY low","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10203481298866804/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T15:38:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T15:46:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243650","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977243650"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good movie and have many surprise","displayName":"salman s","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T15:37:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T15:39:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243645","realm":"RT","displayName":"salman s","accountLink":"/user/id/977243645"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"So ambitious with several very disparate films setting the table for this end game and it did not disappoint. \nMuch like LOTR, Infinity War presents dozens of characters, multiple locations and still manages a singular cohesive story. I enjoyed this film. It never felt long and kept me engaged in the story the whole way. It is big in scope but brings us funny and emotional moments that never derail the fantastic ride. It also promises surprises and an uncertain MCU future. My only gripe? A little more CGI attention to the way Thanos moves.","displayName":"Gael R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T15:31:02.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T00:42:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"976861778","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gael R","accountLink":"/user/id/976861778"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
