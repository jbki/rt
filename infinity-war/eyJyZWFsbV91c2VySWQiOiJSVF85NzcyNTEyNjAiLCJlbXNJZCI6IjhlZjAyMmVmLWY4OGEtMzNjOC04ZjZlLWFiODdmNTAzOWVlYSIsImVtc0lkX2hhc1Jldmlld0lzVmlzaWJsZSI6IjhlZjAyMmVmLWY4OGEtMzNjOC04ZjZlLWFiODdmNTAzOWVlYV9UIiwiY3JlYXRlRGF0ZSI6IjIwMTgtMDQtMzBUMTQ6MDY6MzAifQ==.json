Thanks to Marvel Studios that dream is now a reality. This film delivers, and it delivers on many fronts. From visuals, to characters to moral dilemma's. It has something for everyone. This is the culmination of 10 years, and for those of us that have been watching all of the other 18 films, it rewards us for our fandom.","displayName":"Josh S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T13:56:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T14:17:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"976450905","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josh S","accountLink":"/user/id/976450905"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"sooooooooooo fun. very emotional yet funny when it needs to be.

The entire movie is a series of spoilers simply because they've managed to successfully weave together a ridiculous amount of subplots and locations. It's constantly fast-paced and in your face...but I think that was my issue. There wasn't any real pacing (for me), just constant \"go go go!\" and \"bet you didn't see that coming!\". Almost to the point of fa service? Which is a little funny, because I simultaneously left feeling a little underwhelmed. I've seen all the Marvel movies and enjoyed a good chunk of them, but I'm most definitely not a \"fan boy\", so that may give me a little distance to have a differing opinion.","displayName":"Fatimah A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T13:49:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T13:55:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"977251241","realm":"RT","displayName":"Fatimah A","accountLink":"/user/id/977251241"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What a movie! Evokes every emotion you love to enjoy while at the movies. Something Marvel has become so great at. The movie, even though it’s 2.5 hours long, flys and you’ll be on the edge of your seat the entire time. The plot is well stitched together and gives plenty of screen time to your favorite hero’s and keeps the plot moving forward. Some of my favorite scenes were interactions between the Avengers and the Guardians. Absolutely loved this movie! When all is said and done, this movie will be in my top 3 for favorite superhero/marvel movies.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T13:49:23.394Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T13:49:23.394Z","user":{"userId":"260036958","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260036958"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Little known fact George R.R.
