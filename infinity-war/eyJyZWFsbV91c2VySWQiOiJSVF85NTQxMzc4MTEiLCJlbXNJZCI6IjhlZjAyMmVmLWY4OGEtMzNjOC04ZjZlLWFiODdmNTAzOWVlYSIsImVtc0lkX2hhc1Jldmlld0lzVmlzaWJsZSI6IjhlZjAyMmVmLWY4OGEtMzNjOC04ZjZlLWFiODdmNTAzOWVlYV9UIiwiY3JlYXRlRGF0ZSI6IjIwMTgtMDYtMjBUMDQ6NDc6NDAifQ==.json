It's a long movie, but you'll be so entertained you won't notice. I didn't expect to like Thanos at all, but he ended up being my favourite character, dynamic and interesting (brilliantly voiced as well). Old favourites from the Avengers series took the back burner in this one (Cap, Black Widow)  to pave the way for a more three-dimensional look at some new ones (Gamora, Scarlet Witch). I'm very pleased with the direction they took the cast, especially with Thor after his transformation in Ragnarok.\n\nA must see.","displayName":"Rebecca H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-19T21:27:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-19T21:27:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"977317303","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rebecca H","accountLink":"/user/id/977317303"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"very good plot, action, suspense and such.
