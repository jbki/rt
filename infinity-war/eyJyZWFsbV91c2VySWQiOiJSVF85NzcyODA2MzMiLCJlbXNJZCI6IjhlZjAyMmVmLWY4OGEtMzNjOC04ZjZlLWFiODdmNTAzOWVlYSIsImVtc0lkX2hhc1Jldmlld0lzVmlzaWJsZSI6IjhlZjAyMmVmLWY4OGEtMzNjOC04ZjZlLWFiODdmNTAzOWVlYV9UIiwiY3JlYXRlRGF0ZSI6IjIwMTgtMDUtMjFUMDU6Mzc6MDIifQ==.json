AND IT DELIVERS!! Yeah these movies have celebrated 10 years but those of us who don't know what the Infinity Stones are/were then is explained for the first time by the Collector. PS No one remembers Thor :Darkworld. \n\nPicking up right they left off with Thor Ragnarok, (Black Panther did come out between these films but it sets up Wakanda and it's characters more so than the Infinity stones story) Thanos (Josh Brolin) is seeking out all six Infinity Stones having acquired two stones already he sends his minions to earth to grab the two hidden away there. Tony Stark realizes it is time to stop the nightmares he has been having since New York's Invasion and stop the mad Titan once and for all. \n\nThis movie is something the fans have been waiting for years and it gives most fans what they wanted! Sure their isn't interaction with say Hulk and Spiderman but it is done in a way you understand why and that goes for all characters. \n\nJosh Brolin as Thanos is one of the Best Villians of all time, Not just Marvel of all time! and that is a huge call to make! The Villian's I think are the best are the ones you understand why they are doing what they are doing and stop and think \"they are right\" Which is so great to see Marvel take those risks. Thanos could of been the biggest let down of all time having had such a build of being the worst guy around but WOW!!! After having some average to say the least villains in the past people like Michael B Jordan, Micheal Keaton and Cate Blanchette having gone to the great lengths to make them understandable and relatable, Kurt Russell was hit and miss. \n\nNot going into Spoilers here but the ending is something you sit there and go \"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! but I feel like I've being punched in the stomach whilst watching it\" The stakes are extreme and the emotions run high!! \n\nHIGHLIGHT in this and their is so many to choose from, is probably The Groot, Rocket and Thor interactions.  \n\n4 1/2","displayName":"Jamie P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/605813378/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-21T03:24:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-21T03:48:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"840664570","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jamie P","accountLink":"/user/id/840664570"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 21, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"AWESOME!
