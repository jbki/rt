When the Mad Titan Thanos comes to Earth to collect the last Infinity Stone the Avengers assemble and wage a desperate battle to save the universe from Thanos' plans for mass genocide.  The film does an extraordinary job at bringing together all of the different Marvel characters and teams them up in interesting ways.  And the chases and fight scenes are incredibly exciting and well-choreographed.  The special effects and the CGI are also really good (with the exception of the disintegration effects).  However, the plot is weak and ends rather abruptly.  Additionally, Thanos proves to be a fairly generic villain and a little too all-powerful.  Yet despite a few weaknesses, Avengers: Infinity War is an unparalleled cinematic event (the culmination of ten years of filmmaking) that has a remarkably ambitious vision.","displayName":"Dann M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-04T12:41:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-04T13:35:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"906395584","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dann M","accountLink":"/user/id/906395584"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A spectacular movie that lives up to the hype and actually delivers a villain worthy of the culmination of the MCU thus far. In a 2.5-hour film, some scenes can be a little slow, and with the largest ensemble cast to date, some of our primary heroes don't get as much screen time as they deserve; but the humor, action, and heart, all perfectly balanced in this high-stakes story, will leave you entertained and hungry for the next installment.","displayName":"Bronsen C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-04T11:23:00.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-04T12:38:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"977511446","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bronsen C","accountLink":"/user/id/977511446"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"For as many characters and story-lines it has, it does well juggling them all.
