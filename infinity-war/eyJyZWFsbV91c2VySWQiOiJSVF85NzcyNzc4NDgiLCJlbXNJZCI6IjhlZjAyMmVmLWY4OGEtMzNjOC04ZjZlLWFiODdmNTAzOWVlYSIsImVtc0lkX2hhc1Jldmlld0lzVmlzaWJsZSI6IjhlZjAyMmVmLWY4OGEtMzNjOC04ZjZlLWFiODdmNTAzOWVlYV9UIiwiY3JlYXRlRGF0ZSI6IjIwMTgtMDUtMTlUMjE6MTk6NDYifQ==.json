The strongest aspect of this movie is Brolin's performance as Thanos, who brings a spectacular example of character complexity.  The sheer scope of this movie is also impressive, with an unprecedented all-star cast coming together.  The downside begins as a different side of that coin, however, as none of the characters in this movie are as compelling as they are in their stand-alone titles.  Despite other critics indicating the contrary, the heroes really do get in each others' way at times.  A decent plot progresses well into a multi-part story, although the big \"deaths\" at the end do not feel genuine and thus lose their dramatic impetus.","displayName":"Joe W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-19T19:43:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-19T19:52:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"977276860","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joe W","accountLink":"/user/id/977276860"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie felt like it was ten years in the making.

I also will mention that the Infinity Gauntlet is inconsistent with being too underpower and too overpowered; it goes back and forth so much. If it is indeed so overpowered; then Thanos must be a thundering dumbass for not using it to its fullest extent in battle.\n\nI will say it is still a solid Marvel film otherwise. While the length is long, the pacing is good and the fights are good. What really impressed me was the 'Team Ironman' duel with Thanos; it was both smart, brutal and well executed.","displayName":"Thomas W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-19T18:47:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-19T18:47:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"906986317","realm":"RT","displayName":"Thomas W","accountLink":"/user/id/906986317"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The ending seemed to sad \nNot enof indeph of child gomora seen","displayName":"Louis T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-19T18:36:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-19T18:39:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"977277590","realm":"RT","displayName":"Louis T","accountLink":"/user/id/977277590"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing ! so good i nearly went back a second time.","displayName":"ad m","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-19T18:30:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-19T18:31:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"977277575","realm":"RT","displayName":"ad m","accountLink":"/user/id/977277575"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 19, 2018"}]}
