Newcommers who havent seen all the previous films (or at least a good many of them) will be completely confused..  but since i'm in the former group I rather enjoyed it.  Not that the film isnt without its flaws... there are some slow moments and a few forced jokes early but the film has a lot more emotional depth than many of the previous films and the cross-over character moments are fun. Putting Thor with the Guardians of the Galaxy and Iron Man with Doctor Strange were good decisions. It's hard to talk too much about this film without revealing spoilers...  but I did enjoy the film and am breathlessly awaiting the next entry. Also, it shouldnt need to be said at this point, but make sure you stick around all the way through the credits.","displayName":"Lincoln K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/755026006/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T08:25:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T08:29:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"824904991","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lincoln K","accountLink":"/user/id/824904991"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Movie Ever I've watched even ending was not good after all no one able to defeat Thanos but still super!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/415095705574442/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T08:24:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T08:27:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"976867179","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976867179"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Nothing like I have ever seen before\n\nITS AMAZING GO CHECK IT OUT","displayName":"Noah S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/455347891466608/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T08:24:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T08:24:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"976297489","realm":"RT","displayName":"Noah S","accountLink":"/user/id/976297489"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
