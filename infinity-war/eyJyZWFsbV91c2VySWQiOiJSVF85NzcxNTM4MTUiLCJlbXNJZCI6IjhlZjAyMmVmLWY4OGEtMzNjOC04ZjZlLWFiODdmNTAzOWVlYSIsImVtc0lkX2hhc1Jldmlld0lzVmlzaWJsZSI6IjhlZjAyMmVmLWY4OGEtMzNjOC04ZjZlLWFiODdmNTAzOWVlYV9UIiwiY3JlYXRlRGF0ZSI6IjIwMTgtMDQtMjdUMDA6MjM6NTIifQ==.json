This new instalment for the Avengers adventure is by far one of the greatest movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story is easy to follow, Thanos's quest to find the 6 Infinity stones. This pits the MCU heroes up against their biggest threat yet. A controversial opinion that ranges from each reviewer is how there are so many heroes in this movie and how it may become confusing to follow each person. For me I believed that it was not confusing and that all the heroes' stories are explained in the best possible way to make a great flowing story. To conclude, I highly recommend that you watch this movie. It is exciting and filled with action and plenty of jokes. This is definitely a film I would pay to see in the movies more than twice.","displayName":"Nick D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T00:20:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T01:08:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241430","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nick D","accountLink":"/user/id/977241430"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wow!

Juggling 10 years worth of characters with opposing tones was never going to be an easy task, but the Russo bros. achieve this with aplomb. It's funny when it needs to be, and doesn't ruin any key scenes with cheap gags. Considering that 2 franchises (after Thor's pivot) are outright comedy films, the balance on the screen should satisfy fans of films such as Winter Soldier as well as fans of Guardians. The structure appears to be inspired by Return of the King (which is no bad thing) but ends with the quiet feeling of Two Towers. The only thing I hated was the end credit scenes, it was more akin to a SONY plug than what we've come to expect from the MCU.","displayName":"Beyond the B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100008312881771/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T00:16:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T00:22:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"965487423","realm":"RT","displayName":"Beyond the B","accountLink":"/user/id/965487423"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Holy heck!!!!
