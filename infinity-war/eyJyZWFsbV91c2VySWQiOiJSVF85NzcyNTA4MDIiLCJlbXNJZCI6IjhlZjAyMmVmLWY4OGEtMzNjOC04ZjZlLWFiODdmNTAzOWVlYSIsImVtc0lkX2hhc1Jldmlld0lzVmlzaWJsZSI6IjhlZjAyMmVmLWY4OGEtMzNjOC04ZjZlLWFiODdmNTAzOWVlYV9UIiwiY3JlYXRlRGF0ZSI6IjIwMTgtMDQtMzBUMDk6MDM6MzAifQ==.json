De lo mejorcito que se ha hecho de superheroes. Se hace corta a pesar de no serlo. Tiene acción a raudales, grandes efectos especiales, buena banda sonora, buenas dosis de humor, una historia que hila perfectamente con todas las películas hechas hasta la fecha y que maneja de manera magistral la aparición de tantísimos grandes personajes, y un enemigo a batir formidable. Además, hay lugar para muchas sorpresas. Me lo he pasado cual niño pequeño viéndola.

This is a movie made for fans. It needed to be a fun movie, and yet it had to deliver on the most colossal multi-movie arcs of all time. It did all of those things. There are some clashing tones and some under developed characters, but I don't see how it could have been any other way. You HAVE to be invested in some of these characters through their development in their other movies, and you HAVE to appreciate their unique tones which were adapted to portray them in their stand-alone movies. For comparison, it is like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows multiplied across different story arcs and different sagas in 19 other movies with separate themes. Or if soap operas ever had a multi-million dollar budget, and A-list actors, and they had to deliver on something akin to to a series finale. You can't just pop in and hope to truly appreciate this film if you don't already know and love these characters. That said, they still managed to build great character arcs unique to this film while also tying into larger story arcs across all of their movies (for a few characters at least). This was a monumental accomplishment of film, and while I do worry about the impact of Disney and the superhero genre on cinema, it is impossible for me not to be in awe of this monolithic level of storytelling. More could have been done, possibly, to have a more consistent tone and theme, which is why I'm rating this movie 4.5 stars. However, it almost doesn't seem fair considering what they accomplished in this culmination of the most ambitious cinematic undertaking in history. So for the majority who only somewhat enjoy superhero movies, this is a 3 or 3.5 star movie, but for the Marvel Cinematic Universe fans this is a 5 star movie and will remain an absolute A+ epic for the rest of your life.","displayName":"Emerson E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T08:59:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T09:30:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"940384252","realm":"RT","displayName":"Emerson E","accountLink":"/user/id/940384252"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Definitely not for non-Comic movie fans, but for those that love silly action movies this was fantastic!
