From beginning to end this movie keeps your attention and builds a narrative that is beyond a single storyline but 30 interwoven lives. All these lives center around one of the most complicated and relatable villains in film history the mad titan thanos. He is so easy to hate with a deep seething hatred but also admired for his dedication and perseverance. All of our heroes get to fight the inevitable end as hard as they can and yes mistakes are made. The humanizing mistakes and decisions make our heroes tangible and grounded. The powerful evolutions of our avengers are amazing to see, a superior spiderman, a lightning slinging thor with a magical weapon, a hugely upgraded modular nanotech ironman, and everyone fully upgraded and seasoned. I give this 5 stars because to bring together a movie like this with each character represented and appreciated is impossible but they did it and did it impossibly well.

It had the acting. It had the special effects. It had the script. It even had some meme-worthy quotes. Recommend having watched several Marvel movies first- especially the Avenger movies and Gaurdians of the Galaxy. Also, Captain America, Dr. Strange, and Black Panther would have been helpful.","displayName":"Dragon o","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-17T14:31:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-17T14:31:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"904676723","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dragon o","accountLink":"/user/id/904676723"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is the best Marvel film.
