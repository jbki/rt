This movie was decent, but not the comparison to Empire Strikes Back that I'm seeing. It offers little in the way of surprises. Only the most gullible could truly believe that the characters killed off will stay dead. I felt nothing as the characters disappeared on screen as each time in my head I knew this was all temporary and that they would all be back. This completely killed the dramatic tension I could have felt and left the experience feeling hollow and flaccid. \nAnyone who has watched Dragonball Z can tell you that one wish from the Dragon (Infinity Gauntlet) is going to turn everything back and make it all okay. Boring. The action was great, and the comedic moments were all well written. Unfortunately, Disney/Marvel has developed a disappointing habit of playing favorites with characters. More popular characters are given preferential treatment in the form of increased power, new gadgets, new abilities, etc. Don't believe me? Watch Captain America: Civil War again, pay attention to anybody who isn't Iron Man or Spiderman and watch Infinity War. They do the same tired tricks, haven't shown any growth in capability, and almost die multiple times against cannon fodder.\nThey should change the title from Avengers to, \"Iron Man, Spiderman, Thor, Doctor Strange and friends.\" Don't get me started on the Hulk. Ever since Mark Ruffalo has taken over the role, the Hulk has turned into a side attraction with little to no impact on whatever movie they just throw him into for no reason. I felt like Mark Ruffalo just wanted more screen time, or maybe they didn't feel like spending money on the CGI necessary to bring the Hulk onto the screen. In any case, I don't know about anybody else, but I'm sick of them trying to prove how deep Bruce Banner is. He should just be the container the Hulk comes in. Period. If Bruce Banner couldn't get it up this time around, he should be thrown to the sidelines with Hawkeye.\n     Also, it's getting pretty old that Disney/Marvel sees fit to kill every new villain that comes onto the screen. I get it, the bad guys need to be stopped. The best and most memorable enemies throughout the history of story telling are those that get to live and fight another day. How else is a relationship between good and evil supposed to develop?The Black Order had no real development, no investment that made me hate them. The Maw was actually an impressive character who I felt was a much better villain than Thanos. If Thanos didn't have the gauntlet, he wouldn't even have deserved any screen time. The Maw had a variety of powers that was interesting and unconventional. They should have given him the Gauntlet. THAT would have been a twist and a half. \nAm I the only one who thinks that Josh Brolin had no personality as Thanos? If you look at comic pictures of Thanos, that grin of his is really menacing. You can see the madness in his face and you just know from looking at him that he is the \"Mad Titan\". The story he gave on Titan about why he wanted to kill half the universe was so boring. \"Just because I have the will\" isn't a good enough motivation, I didn't believe him. I expected the personality and insanity of Thanos to match his power with and without the gauntlet, and I've seen mannequins with more personality and drive. \nDisney/Marvel, if you see this, come up with real motivations for your threats BEFORE you start assembling your cast of Earth's mightiest heroes. Watch Deadpool again and watch Deadpool 2 next month. It's a shame that Josh Brolin looks like he's going to do such an amazing job as Cable when his Thanos fell flat. I know it's not his acting (he's a great actor), it's the writing. I guess I'll see if this gets any better for whatever the next hero reunion is and hope the villain doesn't suck.","displayName":"Ricky E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T17:29:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T19:43:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246862","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ricky E","accountLink":"/user/id/977246862"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Marvel movie yet.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T17:28:55.680Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T17:28:55.680Z","user":{"userId":"966214393","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/966214393"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best film of the genre, ten years have been worth it.","displayName":"Juanjo S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1150163938415503/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T17:28:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T17:31:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"976069668","realm":"RT","displayName":"Juanjo S","accountLink":"/user/id/976069668"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
