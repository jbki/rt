This film is really big so it's hard to explain what exactly is going on but just to sum it up: this guy Thanos wants to wipe half the population in the universe so people who don't thrive will and instead of going from planet to planet doing it he gets a gauntlet and tries to find six stones that will give him the power to do his plan with a snap of his fingers, and The Avengers have to stop him. Thanos is a great villain, he probably ranks in the top five best in the MCU, I just wanted to point that out. So, a cool premise, but there was so much going on in each scene that your mind won't get a break; it was kind of a small clusterfuck. Since there was just so much shit going on, there were some characters who got enough screen time and some with little. The action was good as usual, with some well-choreographed scenes and visual effects. There were some funny scenes that were actually funny so that was nice, but I never got a heart-warming scene like some movies. Since this is technically a \"Part 1\" it ends with a cliffhanger that leaves you both anxious and a little confused. I do give the movie credit, there were some parts that made me raise my eyebrows, but disappointingly not jaw-dropping. So, I'm just going to stop it here, this will be too long of if I keep talking about it. Overall, it's a solid entry in the MCU but not without its flaws. I still enjoyed it anyway, I never looked at my watch due to boredom or curiosity. That being said, I'm excited for Avengers 4 and very curious on how they'll end it.","displayName":"Charlie S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-21T04:54:56.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-21T04:55:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"976938182","realm":"RT","displayName":"Charlie S","accountLink":"/user/id/976938182"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Driven and epic plot with dashes of refreshing comic relief sprinkled throughout.
