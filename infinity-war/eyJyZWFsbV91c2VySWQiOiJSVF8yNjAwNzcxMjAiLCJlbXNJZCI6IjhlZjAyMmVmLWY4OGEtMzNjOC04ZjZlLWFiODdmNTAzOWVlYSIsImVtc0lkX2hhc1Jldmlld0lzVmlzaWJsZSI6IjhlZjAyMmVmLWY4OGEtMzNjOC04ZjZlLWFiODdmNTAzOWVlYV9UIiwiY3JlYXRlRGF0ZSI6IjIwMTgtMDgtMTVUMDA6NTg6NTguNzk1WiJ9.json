I would estimate that each character got about 8 - 10 minutes of screen time expect IronMan and Thanos. Iron Man probably got about 15, and Thanos. What is also great is someone could even only watch the four Avengers films and have a great time and understanding of the story over these past 10 years of movies. A movie packed with easter eggs that only fans would understand, just like all the others.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10215452730249090/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-13T08:38:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-13T08:48:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"977059371","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977059371"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 13, 2018"}]}
