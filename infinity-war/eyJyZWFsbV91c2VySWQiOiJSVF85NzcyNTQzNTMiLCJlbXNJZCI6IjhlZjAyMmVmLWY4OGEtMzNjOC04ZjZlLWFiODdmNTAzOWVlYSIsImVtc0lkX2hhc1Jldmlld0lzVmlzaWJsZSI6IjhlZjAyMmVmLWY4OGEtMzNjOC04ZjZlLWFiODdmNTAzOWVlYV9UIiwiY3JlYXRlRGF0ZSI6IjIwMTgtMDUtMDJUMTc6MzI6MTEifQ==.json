A small omission that permitted the producers  to make a lot of extra cash. Now I think that at least was something unexpected and one of the biggest twists I saw in ages\nWith PART TWO smashing records at the box office, I went back and watched it again, without being pissed off like the first time, and I have to admit that is good action movie. I still think there are too many characters and too many \"kill who you love to save/destroy the universe\" scenes... but I had my fun, and now I will have to go to the cinema and be part of the circus... again.","displayName":"Stefano C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T17:29:17.000Z","updateDate":"2019-05-19T01:16:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"977014085","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stefano C","accountLink":"/user/id/977014085"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was incredible.

The fact that they took all these characters from different films, directed them in one movie, and still made them feel like themselves and have great chemistry together is just fantastic.

While the film is nearly 3 hours the story is smartly blacked into smaller interconnected sub arcs, and the Avengers villian is almost treated as the protagonist of the film. \n\nThe film may not have as pointed a commentary as Nolan's Dark Kight, however it is extremely satisfying to see a Marvel villian with motivations and emotional depth besides Loki.","displayName":"Johnny K A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/5227771/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T16:55:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T17:30:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"782078987","realm":"RT","displayName":"Johnny K A","accountLink":"/user/id/782078987"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A PERFECT CONCLUSION FOR 10 YEARS OF MOVIES.","displayName":"Jonatan D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T16:54:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T16:55:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"928126088","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonatan D","accountLink":"/user/id/928126088"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Thanos!!
