The only downfall may be some little connection to Thanos and Lady Death and the fact some characters can not be used because of copy right legislation.

Humour was small and mostly at good moments and rarely disjointed tension. Not a generic storyline, and was really a film for the fans.

I have seen a lot of people talk about how it seems like an incomplete movie and yes that is true, but you should remember that this is the first part of two movies, it was meant to leave you wanting more or at least wondering what will happen to our fallen heroes. Secondly, if you are going to watch this movie then you should know about certain characters relationships. This was done well with not spending a lot of time to explain these because you should go into this movie already knowing this information.  Which brings me to my next point, the death of many heroes. This was not a surprise to me because I did read the comic story line that this was bringing to the big screen. However everybody know that they will bring back the majority of the heroes that were killed off at the end yet people still complain. Please remember that this is a comic book movie and nothing in comics is permanent, at least not most of the time. My guess is that they will kill of certain people for good in part two. Now this wouldn't be a review with out some criticism and my main point are the jumping around to different characters and some of the CGI. The first point of to much random jumping is one that I can easily let go, as there are many important stories in this movie, but I still think that it could have been done in a more orderly way rather than leaving us without a certain group for longer than the others. Finally the CGI was lacking in some areas I believe but there was very little that had this problem. Over all I think that this was a great movie and a outstanding payoff to anyone that kept track of these movies over the course of ten years.","displayName":"Grayson R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T03:59:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T04:12:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247911","realm":"RT","displayName":"Grayson R","accountLink":"/user/id/977247911"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"}]}
