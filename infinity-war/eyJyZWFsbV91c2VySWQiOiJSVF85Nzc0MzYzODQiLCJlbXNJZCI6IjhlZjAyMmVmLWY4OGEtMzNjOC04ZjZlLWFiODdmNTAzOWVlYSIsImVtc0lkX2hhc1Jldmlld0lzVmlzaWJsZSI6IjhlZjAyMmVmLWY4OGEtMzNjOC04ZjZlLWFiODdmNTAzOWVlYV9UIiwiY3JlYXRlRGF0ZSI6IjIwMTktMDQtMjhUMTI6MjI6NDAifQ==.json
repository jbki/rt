I found myself almost leaping out of my seat at certain points, especially that Thor moment with the main theme. I feel that all the characters in this film were utilised to the best of their ability which made for an exciting and satisfying viewing, not to mention emotional. The only drawback to this film, for me, was that your enjoyment of it will be highly dependant on how many of the main marvel films you have seen previously. You may not be as moved as you thought you were going to be if you go into this thinking it will just be an epic action movie, its heavily dependant on the ongoing plot of the franchise. 4.5/5.","displayName":"Juan L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-28T08:30:27.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-28T08:38:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"978015328","realm":"RT","displayName":"Juan L","accountLink":"/user/id/978015328"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I didn't think the Russo's would have it in them to pull this off, but they did.
