Some of the story seemed far-fetched even for Marvel, but our experienced cast at playing their character's, made it believable.\n\nThe character introductions with \"Avenger's\" seemed to be the highlights of the movie, and in my opinion was well done.  The only real downside to this movie would be the now well known  bitter cliffhanger ending, leaving us with no glimmer of hope or resolution...  Well,  not unless you wait past all the end credits.","displayName":"Cal B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-03-02T21:44:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T19:09:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"965539372","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cal B","accountLink":"/user/id/965539372"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"best marvel movie yet","displayName":"max p","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-03-02T17:22:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T15:26:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"977144356","realm":"RT","displayName":"max p","accountLink":"/user/id/977144356"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"pretty good movie will say I'm upset about the ending","displayName":"CourtneyQueen C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1537955631/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-03-01T10:13:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-19T18:21:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"906602227","realm":"RT","displayName":"CourtneyQueen C","accountLink":"/user/id/906602227"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"one of my favorite films of 2018 so far","displayName":"Jack H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1680540650/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-02-27T07:06:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T08:49:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"891178673","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jack H","accountLink":"/user/id/891178673"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Phenomenal movie.
