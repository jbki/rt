Speaking of spoilers this isn't gonna spoil much but it's just to address the attitude towards to ending, ok don't look if you haven't seen it yet\n\n\n\n\nMany people complain about how the ending is gonna get undone all the deaths won't matter, and while it is true some of the characters have contracts and sequels coming up, the deaths still matter the characters that lived still see everyone around them die and they don't know about a 4th wall, and the pain that they go through seeing it happen is displayed quite well, you don't feel the pain of the people dying you feel the pain of the people left behind looking at the pile of ash and dust that was someone they cared about, just like in real life you don't feel the pain of dying you feel the pain or watching those around you die, and (If they get cremated) you then have the pile of dust as a remnant of all that's left","displayName":"Dan B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/634004380099376/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T09:35:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-08T09:46:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"974779483","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dan B","accountLink":"/user/id/974779483"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"If I could give this a million stars if I could!
