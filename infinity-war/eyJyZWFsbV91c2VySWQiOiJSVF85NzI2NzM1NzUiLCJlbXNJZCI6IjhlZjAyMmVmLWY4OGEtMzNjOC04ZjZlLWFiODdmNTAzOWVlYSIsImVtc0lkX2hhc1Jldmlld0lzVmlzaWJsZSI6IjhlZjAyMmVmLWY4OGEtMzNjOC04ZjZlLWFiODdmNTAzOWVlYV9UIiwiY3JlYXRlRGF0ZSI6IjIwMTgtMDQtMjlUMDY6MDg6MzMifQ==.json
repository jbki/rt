However, Infinity War has a slightly darker tone than most Marvel movies and definetly have more emotional scenes, but the emotional scenes arent extremely sad scenes where it worth crying for. Some characters make decisions does not seem like they would and the movie's pacing felt like a 4hr runtime. The movie is choppy and disjointed and feels like sequences just thrown together all at once. However, theres finally a cliffhanger, however when the movie ended it may seem like a \"What? Thats it?\" kind of reaction. Infinity War is a good movie, but it doesnt live  up to the hype imo.","displayName":"Nicholas N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1706372779631586/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T05:56:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-04T20:47:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"974330843","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nicholas N","accountLink":"/user/id/974330843"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome Movie Sad Action Everything Everyone needs Nicest Movie of the Year  \nLove Marvel Love Avengers !!!!!!","displayName":"ALI B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T05:55:09.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T13:23:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248065","realm":"RT","displayName":"ALI B","accountLink":"/user/id/977248065"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A phenomenal cinematic experience.
