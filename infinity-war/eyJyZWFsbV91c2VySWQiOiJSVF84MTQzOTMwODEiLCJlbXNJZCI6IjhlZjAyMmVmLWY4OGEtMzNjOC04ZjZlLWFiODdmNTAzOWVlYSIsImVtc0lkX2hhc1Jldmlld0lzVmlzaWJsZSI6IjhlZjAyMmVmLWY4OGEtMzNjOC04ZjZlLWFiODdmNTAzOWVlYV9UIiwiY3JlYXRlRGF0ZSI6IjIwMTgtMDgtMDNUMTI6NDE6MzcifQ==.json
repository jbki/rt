It is a turning point in not just Marvel Cinematic history, but for movie history too. The CGI is stunning and a huge step forward for more CGI movies in the future. The acting was so on point that it is simple to understand truly how the characters are feeling throughout the movie, and their emotions clearly portray it, making this movie even more dramatic and amazing. The story line and twists back to back made me on the edge of my eat, excited to see what would happen next. Overall, this movie is absolutely amazing, and speaking for all of the fans: one of the best Marvel movies out there to date. I'm very excited and eager to see what would happen in the next movie, Avengers 4, and I bet that the other Marvel fans have the same feelings as me towards this incredible movie.","displayName":"Flasa F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-03T11:00:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-03T11:00:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"977375143","realm":"RT","displayName":"Flasa F","accountLink":"/user/id/977375143"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"it was so slow that i finished slept","displayName":"Simon M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-03T10:00:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-04T07:51:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"977394120","realm":"RT","displayName":"Simon M","accountLink":"/user/id/977394120"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I keep watching this over and over it's the best marvel movie all time I'm waiting for avengers 4 the cgi is amazing too","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2171458913137681/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-03T09:06:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-03T09:07:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"977394061","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977394061"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was by far the best marvel movie and the best movie I've ever seen.
