There is essentially no story or character development here to the point where it feels more like a compilation of action scenes from a much larger series of movies. On top of that Thanos's plan is just sheer idiocy and does not even solve the problem he claims to be fighting to prevent. If you want to make a movie about Thanos than make a movie specifically about thanos, there are far too many characters and plots going on in this to even keep track without either a notepad or extensive knowledge of the MCU.","displayName":"joshua k","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T11:59:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T12:05:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"977259441","realm":"RT","displayName":"joshua k","accountLink":"/user/id/977259441"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"How are y'all gonna kill off Spiderman .
