Very well made build up worth of 10 years waiting to see how epic the journey goes. I love how they introduce all of the characters, well almost all of them in all of the other Marvel movies we've seen in the past to this date and know each backstory to them and what they really want to do whatever is necessary to save the world and the universe no matter what it takes and are willing to sacrifice their lives as any superhero would. My only complaint is the repetitive comedy like c'mon for real. Where are the intensity and drama when there is suppose to be some serious moments because of the fact they're going to face the greatest villain yet? The comedy was okay back in 2013 til like 2015. After that, it wasn't even relevant anymore since they keep making jokes, I got so bored of that nonsense. Don't know if anyone feels that way or agrees with me, but I'm just trying to make an opinion about how I feel for this movie. Don't get me wrong, I loved every single Marvel movie so far, is just that it feels old now don't you think? I hope in the next phase of Marvel movies, they take it in a different direction and put some actual sense of drama to make it interesting and memorable. Sure a lot of people do love comedy and I respect that, but it's just not for me. I like it to be intense, serious and touching. I hope some people understand what I'm trying to say. And that's all I have to say. Anyways, I can't wait for Captain Marvel in 2019!! Keep it up Marvel!!!","displayName":"Seth T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-22T18:56:09.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-22T19:35:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"976488697","realm":"RT","displayName":"Seth T","accountLink":"/user/id/976488697"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 22, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Marvel has gone weird!
