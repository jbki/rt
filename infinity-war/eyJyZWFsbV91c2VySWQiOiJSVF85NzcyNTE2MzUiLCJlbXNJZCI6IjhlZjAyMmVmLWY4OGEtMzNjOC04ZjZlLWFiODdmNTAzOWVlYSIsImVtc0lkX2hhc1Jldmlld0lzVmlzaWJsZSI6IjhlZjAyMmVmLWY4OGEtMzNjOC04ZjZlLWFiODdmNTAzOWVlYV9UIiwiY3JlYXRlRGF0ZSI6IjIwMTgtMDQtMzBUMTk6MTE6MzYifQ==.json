Far too many characters were at play to really develop any of the characters. Did like the ending though but with a story plagued plot holes and a failure to really set the stakes. The movie dedicates so much time to what thanos can do without the stones. That it left me wondering why he even needed them in the first place.

They don't spend too much time on any one part.  If you're a die hard fan, like I am, you'll love this film. If you've never seen any of the movies, you can still love the movie. You won't have the same emotional attachment the rest of us have, but a quick recap on the end of Thor and the science of Wakanda, you'll be set to see the movie.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10216339285453614/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T19:07:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T19:11:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"977251625","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977251625"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome movie!

Mother. Of. Marvel.\n\nThis was the best movie of the entire franchise so far. I expected emotion, I did not expect to feel so personally victimized from Thanos. I feel like I need therapy after that movie! Unexpected, fast paced, relentless, and yet so funny and moving. \n\nThe cast performed brilliantly. No cheesy jokes, well-timed humor. Literally brilliant.\nI feel like anyone giving this less than four stars needs their brain checked, or they are just trolling to pull down the rating.","displayName":"Melissa L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T19:03:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T19:07:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"941240603","realm":"RT","displayName":"Melissa L","accountLink":"/user/id/941240603"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It changes everything.
