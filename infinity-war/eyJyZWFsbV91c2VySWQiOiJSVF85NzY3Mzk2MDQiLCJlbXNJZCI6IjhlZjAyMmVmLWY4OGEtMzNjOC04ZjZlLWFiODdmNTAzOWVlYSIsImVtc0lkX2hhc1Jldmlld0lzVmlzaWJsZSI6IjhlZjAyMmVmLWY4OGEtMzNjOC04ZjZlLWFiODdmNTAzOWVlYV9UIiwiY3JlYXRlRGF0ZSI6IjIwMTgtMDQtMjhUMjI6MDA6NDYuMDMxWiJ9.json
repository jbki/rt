I expected more shocks and surprises. loved the team ups. I enjoyed how deep a character Thanos became. he's not a paper villain. my fave characters were Scarlet Witch, the Hulk and Thor. didn't understand the move by Doctor Strange and also a fake out death. I thought there'd more shocking and sad moments. with this being a two parter, I was naturally not satisfied with the ending and potential cliffhangers. I'll be seeing again at least twice to see if my feelings change or if I find something I missed. don't know if was my theater or the movie but a few times, I couldn't understand the dialogue. I'm also old lol. I think this was spoiler free. go see it. at least twice","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T21:57:17.052Z","updateDate":"2018-05-26T05:05:19.060Z","user":{"userId":"935610794","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/935610794"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Shocking and thrilling with great story telling.

The Marvel formula consists of drastic changes of tone on the flip of a dime, which is just as present as ever in this film, but is countered by an incredibly interesting and terrifying villain, unlike hardly any other Marvel film. That fact by itself makes it a huge step up in comparison to the previous, but that combined with the incredible scope of nearly every character in the MCU being present and handled appropriately and entertainingly, makes this movie a wonderful experience. It's the best Marvel has put out there since Iron Man 3.","displayName":"Christian B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T21:50:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T21:56:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"975004428","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christian B","accountLink":"/user/id/975004428"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
