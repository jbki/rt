This was not an Avengers movie.  This was a Thanos movie.  It was a let's see how many Marvel characters we can get into one movie movie.  It had little to do with the Avengers.  The Avengers just happened to be there.  This was about Thanos and his goons treating the Marvel characters like annoying ants to be squashed.  Thor is a so-named \"god.\"  Would he really have so little power against even the weakest of Thanos's goons?  Give me a break.\n\nThis was a movie of almost nothing but fights where the Marvel characters were continually beaten up; and about how much could be blown up/knocked down/generally destroyed, etc.; and that was boring, boring, boring.  I'd have been happy to skip this movie and go straight to next year's.\n\nHAWKEYE SPOILER ALERT.  I may be only one of about five people whose favorite Marvel character is Hawkeye.  If you are wondering about Hawkeye, no, he is not in this movie.  I understand why the producers/director/screenwriter/whoever did it, but that doesn't make the movie any easier to watch.  (It just feels like Hawkeye doesn't get any respect by the moviemakers.)  The only reason I didn't walk out was that I kept hoping that Hawkeye would eventually show up, even in the Easter Egg.  No such luck.  (Instead, a new character was introduced.)\n\nMAYBE A SPOILER ALERT?  And seriously, people are getting upset at/crying over the characters who \"died???\"  Give me a break.  One of the infinity stones allows one to go back in time.  Those characters will be back by the end of the next movie, probably including the first character who died, way back at the beginning of the movie.  (Otherwise, how could one have the upcoming sequal movies?)  (It would lovely, too, if one could use the stone to go back and save the Warriors Three and Lady Sif, if she is, indeed, dead.)","displayName":"Emily K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-13T08:58:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-13T09:55:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"977267078","realm":"RT","displayName":"Emily K","accountLink":"/user/id/977267078"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"So you want subversion eh? You like movies that \"subvert your expectations?\" Ha. Well kids, you GOT IT. This is how its done. People had expectations and ALL were surpassed. There are problems yes, and you could argue that the \"Final Solution\" is a bit of a mess, but they weaved a story here that was SIMPLE and STRAIGHT forward without being preachy and trying too hard. Lots of things thematically going on and though it drags in places, it has enough action to keep a 9 year old enthralled. The 7 year old was traumatised. Very upset and says he hates it. Up until. . . the end, he was enjoying it though. . . The main thing I warned my kids about before going to see this, is \"this movie will teach you about loss.\" Our generation had Optimus Prime dying and that taught us about death. Now we have kids learning from Thanos. . . a worthy teacher IMHO. Oh and Thanos is the biggest baddest villain of all time, the ONLY man to scare the HULK into submission. . . yes. OK.
