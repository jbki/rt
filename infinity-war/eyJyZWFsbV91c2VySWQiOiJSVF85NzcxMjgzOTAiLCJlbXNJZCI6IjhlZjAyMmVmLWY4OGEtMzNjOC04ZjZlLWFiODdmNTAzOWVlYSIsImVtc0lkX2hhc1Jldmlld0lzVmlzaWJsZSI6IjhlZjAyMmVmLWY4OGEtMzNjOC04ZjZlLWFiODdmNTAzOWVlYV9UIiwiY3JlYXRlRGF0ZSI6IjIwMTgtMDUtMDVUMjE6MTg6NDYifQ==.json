Now all that remains is what is the next step: how can our heroes recover from the losses they've suffered, has Thanos truly won, and how will the next Avengers film wrap everything up?\nThe post credits scene luckily still paves the way for newer, future stories which I'm all for\nUntil then this is the best MCU film to date with pretty much the finest villain Marvel Studios has put to film from the page, I applaud both directors Joe and Anthony Russo for making the LOTR of comic book films!","displayName":"Jon C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1368360447/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T20:57:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-29T19:58:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"830741578","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jon C","accountLink":"/user/id/830741578"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Avengers : Infinity wars is a fast paced action movie with comedy and drama.

Every time Thanos is on screen it sucks the life out of the movie .. and not in a good way. He is honestly boring and not nearly as engaging as Kilmonger , Ledger's Joker or any other A list memorable villain . The depiction of the Hulk in this film is downright terrible.. That is not the Hulk at all.. It's sad that after Marvel got it right in the movie the Incredible Hulk , that they would let the character fall this far down their superhero totem pole..","displayName":"Alfred S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T20:22:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T20:41:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"962450147","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alfred S","accountLink":"/user/id/962450147"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What a ride!!!
