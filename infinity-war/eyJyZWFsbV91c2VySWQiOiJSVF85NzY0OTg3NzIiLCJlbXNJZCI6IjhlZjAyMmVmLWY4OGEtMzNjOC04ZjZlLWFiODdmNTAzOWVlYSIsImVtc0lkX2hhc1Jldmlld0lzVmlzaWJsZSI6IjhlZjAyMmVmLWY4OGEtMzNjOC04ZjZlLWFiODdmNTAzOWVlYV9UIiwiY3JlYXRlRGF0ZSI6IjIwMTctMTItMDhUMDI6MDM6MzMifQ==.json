It's a great film with a great story and screenplay written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely who are common MCU writers. It contains great performances from the whole cast who all do an amazing job with their roles! It's a great achievement for 10 years of the MCU. The Russo Brothers who are common MCU directors do a great job directing and they make it look great. Basically every hero in the MCU teaming up is something we've all wanted to see for a very long time. The film is something that tons of fans love and will for sure keep the coming for the next films to come!","displayName":"Callan D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-05T15:09:09.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-16T19:24:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"976648606","realm":"RT","displayName":"Callan D","accountLink":"/user/id/976648606"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Definitely a majority of this movie is to set up for the inevitable sequel... which was one of my biggest gripes with Age Of Ultron.

Thanos is the BEST VILLIAN IN THE MCU ever. The story is told from his perspective and is among the reason that this movie works so well. While not perfect, the pacing and jumping could have been a bit more paced, the end result is one that truly amazes me as a lifelong marvel fan. Truly a story that is so much better the more you have seen these movies, but stands on its own as a movie. It is amazing that they managed to stick the landing while doing so much. Very much worthy of the Endgame the MCU is now reaching.","displayName":"Zachary C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-04T12:44:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-10T18:35:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"973824909","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zachary C","accountLink":"/user/id/973824909"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I feel like I just gave birth to a Thanos-sized baby.\n\nI have been physically and emotionally drained by this movie from start to finish, as it starts with an intense sense of foreboding, and carries that throughout the entire rest of the film. This is edge-of-your-seat excitement, and it is not hyperbole to say so. Around every corner is something dangerous and unpredictable, and for all the scenes that feature so many of the heroes Marvel has cultivated over the last decade, it never feels cluttered.\n\nThe Russos carefully pace the introductions and the separation of scenes, never feeling like our stay with a certain group of heroes is too long or too short. We have come a long way to get here, and in doing so, we are not cheated in any way by how the story unfolds.\n\nJosh Brolin's Thanos is the real star of the movie. A background villain, ever looming in the shadows and on the horizon, he finally gets his moment, and garners ample screen time and development, unlike so many villains before him. His motives are laid out in an expert sort of way, much like Killmonger's in Black Panther, and it creates a richer experience. Thanos relies on Brolin's capabilities as an actor to become real, and Brolin is more than up to the challenge.\n\nThe visuals on Thanos are remarkable as well; every subtle facial tick and reaction is intensely detailed, and incredibly realistic. That sort of skill elevates the product as a whole, immersing the audience in its world seamlessly.\n\nAnd then there's that ending. Oh, we must talk about that ending. There have been none like it, and the reactions in the theater when you see it will be unlike any you've ever had in a Marvel movie before. The Russos took some big chances, brought together the universe that so many before them have built, and blasted the whole thing into space for one two and-a-half hour thrill ride, with another installment to come.\n\nIs it May 2019 yet?","displayName":"Jason R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1040087599/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-04T11:24:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T17:30:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"808857490","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jason R","accountLink":"/user/id/808857490"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"the movie was better then avenger 1 and 2 especially 2 but I didn't like how bad guy won at the end and made a couple super hero disappear and died ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-04T07:27:12.006Z","updateDate":"2018-05-13T03:47:43.771Z","user":{"userId":"951767428","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/951767428"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Avengers: Infinity War not only manages to  juggle an enormous cast but it also manages to be a great film full of heart,drama and humor.","displayName":"Theondoris K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-04T06:04:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T03:20:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"976331315","realm":"RT","displayName":"Theondoris K","accountLink":"/user/id/976331315"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie, delivered on all it's potential.
