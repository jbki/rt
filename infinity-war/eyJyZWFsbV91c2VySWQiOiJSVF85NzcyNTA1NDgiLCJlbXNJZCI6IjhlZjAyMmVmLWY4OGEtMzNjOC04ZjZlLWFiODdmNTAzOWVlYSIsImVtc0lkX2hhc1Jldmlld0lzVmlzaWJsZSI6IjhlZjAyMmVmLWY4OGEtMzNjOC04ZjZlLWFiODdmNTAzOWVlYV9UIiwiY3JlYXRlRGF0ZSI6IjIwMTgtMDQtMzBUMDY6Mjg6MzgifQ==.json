Well, a dull thud, at least. Thanos is known for having said he'd rather be hit by anyone other than Hulk. Yet, in the first scene we see Thanos easily man handle Hulk. I half expected Thanos to say, \"Puny Hulk\" afterward. From there, the story gets better, though not without plot holes, some of which I'll ignore. After all, it's a movie about comic book characters who defy logic and reality. So, what would be the fun if I didn't. We finally get the Thor we should have gotten in Ragnarok. Hulk is absent from the rest of the film, presumably because he's pouting at getting beaten up. And the only Avenger to draw blood from Thanos is... wait for it... Iron Man!?! Scratch that. Thor shows up at the end and draws blood, too. But, it was pointless. We were promised a complete movie. And, when a movie is packed with heroes, you expect to leave feeling good and hopeful. Death's have to have made sense, as in sacrificed for victory. Instead, I left wonder what the point of it all was, and fumed that they basically cut a story in half to make two movies. I doubt I'll see the second one in the theater. I should have learned my lesson after Ragnarok.","displayName":"Kenyon H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T06:02:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T06:13:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"976834258","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kenyon H","accountLink":"/user/id/976834258"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"}]}
