If you are in any way like me, the new Avengers film will take you on a thrill ride like you have never experienced before. I found the first instances of humor a bit jarring but in fact they help counteract some of the darkest scenes ever seen in an MCU film. Pay close attention to everything and have fun speculating what will happen next.","displayName":"Lothar D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T04:07:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T04:11:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"901036430","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lothar D","accountLink":"/user/id/901036430"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
