Everyone except the original avengers are gone??? Okay...we all know that with the infinity gauntlet they are able to bring people back to life so why waste this emotional funeral scenes for this??? Also if they bring everyone back what about quicksilver??? Can he come back too?! If not poor him!!! Anyways this film is amazing if you’re a fan of seeing some of these comic book icons on screen. But story wise they really need a better job. Don’t get me wrong this movie is was better organized and way better put that justice league...buuuuut the cgi did lack and was surprising to me since it is a high caliber movie. Other than that I love the guardians sad to see them go except for rocket the “rat” and I’m just waiting for the next part now. I’m not paying for Ant-Man unless it has something to do with this one cuz he wasn’t in this neither was Hawkeye. Oh and spoiler alert for those who are almost at the end of this rant.
