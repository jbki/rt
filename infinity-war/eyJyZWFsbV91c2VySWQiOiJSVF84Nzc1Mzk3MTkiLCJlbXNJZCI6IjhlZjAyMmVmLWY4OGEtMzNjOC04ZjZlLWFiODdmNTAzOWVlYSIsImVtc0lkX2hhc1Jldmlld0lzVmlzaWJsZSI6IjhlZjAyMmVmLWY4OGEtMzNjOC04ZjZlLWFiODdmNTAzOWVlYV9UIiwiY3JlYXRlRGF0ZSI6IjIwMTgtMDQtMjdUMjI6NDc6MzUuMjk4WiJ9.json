Marking the passing of a decade since the conception of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Infinity War acknowledges that Marvel’s audience has grown up. There’s a seemingly hopeless amount of characters packed into this story, but the Russo brothers make the bold decision to establish big bad Thanos as the primary protagonist, and the film is all the better for it. The film is very fast paced in the beginning but then it smoothes it’s self out and slows. The insane amount of action and characters means that not everybody gets enough screen time, but most make an impact on the story, in some form or another. Some of the new relationships and conflicts work extraordinarily well – Doctor Strange and Tony Stark make for pitch-perfect rivals, and Star Lord’s gut-wrenching jealousy toward the sculpted, hyper-masculine Thor is hilarious. Every single member of the team tries their utmost to prevent the apocalypse, and occasionally, even come infuriatingly close to overpowering Thanos. But it’s never quite enough, and one important distinction between Thanos and the Avengers is repeatedly highlighted – our heroes are emotional creatures, unwilling to sacrifice their friends for the greater good, while Thanos is stone cold. The final act, including the post-credits sting, brings a chill, a darkness and a hush that represent something new in this universe. Infinity War is the first half of the final installment in the series, and it concludes with a premonition of finality. Its intimations of grief and terror feel shrewdly attuned to what is happening in the actual, unmarvelous world. Ultimately, Infinity War is a great film and one for the ages. This movie goes right into the top 5 of MCU movies and it just might be in the top 5 of all comic book movies. I recommend seeing this movie on the biggest possible screen, to experience it in it's full glory.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T22:46:39.534Z","updateDate":"2018-07-08T16:15:04.387Z","user":{"userId":"260001155","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260001155"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best.

I had a wonderful time.  The movie had just the right of funny & fun, thrills & suspense, action, sadness, and drama.  BRAVO Marvel, BRAVO.  It was fun to see so many different \"worlds\" mixing together.  \n\nWhat I liked:  The Acting, the Script, Sound editing/mixing, Production Design, Directing, and Cinematography...all were top notch.  The MANY battle scenes were a real treat to watch.\n\nWhat I didn't like:  A few MINOR things didn't make sense from time to time, but not much I didn't like.  I wasn't thrilled with how Thanos \"looked\"...felt a bit too human for me...but that's just me.  I think I would have loved this movie to be broken up into two movies.  Some of the amazing scenes could have been even greater if they had more time to develop a few more plot points.  \n\nVerdict:  GO SEE THIS MOVIE.  It's long, so I wouldn't take small children, unless they are big fans.","displayName":"Josh B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T22:43:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T22:44:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"967840684","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josh B","accountLink":"/user/id/967840684"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Really great villain, great story and characters.

It is very hard to make a movie with some 20+ actors you can name off the top of your head now, but they do it in a unique way. I felt like with the time that they had to explain the MCU plot holes, etc., they did a wonderful job. I enjoy each character in a different way and thought the interaction and action was outstanding. Very heartfelt movie from beginning to end.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T22:39:33.217Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T22:39:33.217Z","user":{"userId":"911773020","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/911773020"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Same old Marvel nonsense.
