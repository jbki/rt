From start to finish, the Russo brothers certainly showed their skill in maintaining an even and exciting pace throughout the whole film. I was definitely never bored with this one. The jokes were awesome, the action was spectacular and the acting was on point as well. This movie definitely brought the adrenaline rush to everyone who has come out to see it so far and on that end, it doesn't disappoint. For me, however, what prevented this movie from scoring higher than a 4 star rating was the last 3rd of the film beginning with the climatic battle sequence in Wakanda. For a movie touted as being the largest assemblage of superheroes ever put together on screen, the final battles felt underwhelming and not on a large scale as I had hoped. Furthermore, the deaths in the movie (with the exception of 2) just didn't feel very meaningful to me considering we all know the movies coming our way from Marvel for the next few years. Are they really dead? Probably not to be honest (except for THOSE 2). I wish the deaths in the film had been more impactful to me but knowing what's already coming just made the ending of the movie feel like a missed opportunity for something grand yet tragic at the same time. Of course, the story is not over yet as we have to still wait for the conclusion next year so maybe then we can see that EPIC final battle I've been wanting to see. Most likely, this was merely the opening skirmish and if so, then YES, that was awesome. Thanos was a force to be reckoned with and his apocalyptic intentions coupled the Infinity Gauntlet made him an unstoppable force. Now we wait an entire year for the conclusion!","displayName":"Adrian D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T14:43:47.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-21T12:55:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"905421310","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adrian D","accountLink":"/user/id/905421310"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"2 and 1/2 hours of ballistic action with and ending that will leave you speechless.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2126367884311493/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T14:43:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T14:44:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249172","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977249172"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"probably the best mcu movie definitely better than Black panther","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/361376377708001/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T14:39:32.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T14:41:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249162","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977249162"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A love letter to the fans, <3","displayName":"Parker E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T14:36:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T17:06:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"904801325","realm":"RT","displayName":"Parker E","accountLink":"/user/id/904801325"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Todos los detalles del mcu estan mas q bien conectados y tooodo encaja muy bien","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1319598531507214/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T14:36:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T14:37:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249156","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977249156"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"}]}
