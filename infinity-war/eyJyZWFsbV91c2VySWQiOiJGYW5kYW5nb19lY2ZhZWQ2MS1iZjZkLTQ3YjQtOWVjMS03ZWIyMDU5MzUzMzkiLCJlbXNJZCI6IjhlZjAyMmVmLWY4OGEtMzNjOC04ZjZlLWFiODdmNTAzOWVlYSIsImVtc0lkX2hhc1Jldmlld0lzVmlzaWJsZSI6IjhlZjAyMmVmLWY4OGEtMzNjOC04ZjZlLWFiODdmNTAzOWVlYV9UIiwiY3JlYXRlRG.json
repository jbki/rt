Thanos is too good for the big screen. Thor is amazing here, unlike in his solo films. Iron man is smart like always. Captain America takes the back seat but that's alright. Only Marvel film where the bad guy wins! Instant classic.","displayName":"Brian D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/963028220706544/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-04T03:48:21.354Z","updateDate":"2019-11-04T03:48:21.354Z","user":{"userId":"978371990","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian D","accountLink":"/user/id/978371990"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"BOOOOOOOOOOM The end of an era.
