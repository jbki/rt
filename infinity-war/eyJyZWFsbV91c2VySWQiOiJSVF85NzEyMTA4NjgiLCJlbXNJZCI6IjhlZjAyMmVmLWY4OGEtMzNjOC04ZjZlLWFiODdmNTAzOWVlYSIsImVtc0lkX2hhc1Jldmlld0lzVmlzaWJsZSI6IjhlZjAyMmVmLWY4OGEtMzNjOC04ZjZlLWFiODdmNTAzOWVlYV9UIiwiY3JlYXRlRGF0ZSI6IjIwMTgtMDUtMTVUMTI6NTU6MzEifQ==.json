Más allá de los sorprendentes efectos visuales o la majestuosa banda sonora de Alan Silvestri, aquí era hora de que todos se vieran las caras, uniendo fuerzas contra un enemigo en común, con un objetivo bien definido.

Infinty war could mainly seen as a movie which mobed around thanos building up his character to show wat he really is and wat he stands for infinty war struck gold with his character. All though they went ri8 with thanos they missed out on some main characters who lacked screen time . All in all infinty war had a very well structured plot which connects bits and pieces from the last 10 years hence creating a brilliant movie worth the name and very brave end to the movie as well","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/314952032245500/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T12:13:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T12:18:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"976858353","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976858353"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Hats off to the studio and cast for keeping the big reveals hidden all this time.  Trailers have a habit of giving too much away these days so I was skeptical.  The movie gave us a much needed villain with an excellent backstory and purpose beyond the generic \"conquer and power\"  the dialogue was potent with many emotions and was amazed the 2.5 hours was done when it was!  Excellent job with comic book references and use of material, juggling that many characters with individual story arcs that remained relevant even  if it was touched on just for a minute.  There will never be a movie franchise of this size and depth and if there is... it will always be compared to Marvel's","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10216260363601368/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T11:45:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T11:54:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"977269949","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977269949"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Amazing film that mamanges to weave multiple plots together very well. Also the screentime between characters is very well managed which is no small feat! Spoiler ahead: The only thing that could have made this a better movie is if they took out Star Lord punching Thanos. In an instant it seemed as if audiences forgot about the death of Gamorah and its emotional impact and instead thought about how Star Lords actions were selfish and shortsided. They could've easily had Thanos overpower Mantis and grab the gauntlet without Star Lord causing it, thus preserving the emotional impact of Gamorah's death on Peter and the aduience. Overall this was an amazing movie, but with that small addition I believe it would've been a perfect movie or as close to a perfect movie as you can get.","displayName":"S A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T11:21:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T11:28:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"977269921","realm":"RT","displayName":"S A","accountLink":"/user/id/977269921"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"And that's how it's done.
