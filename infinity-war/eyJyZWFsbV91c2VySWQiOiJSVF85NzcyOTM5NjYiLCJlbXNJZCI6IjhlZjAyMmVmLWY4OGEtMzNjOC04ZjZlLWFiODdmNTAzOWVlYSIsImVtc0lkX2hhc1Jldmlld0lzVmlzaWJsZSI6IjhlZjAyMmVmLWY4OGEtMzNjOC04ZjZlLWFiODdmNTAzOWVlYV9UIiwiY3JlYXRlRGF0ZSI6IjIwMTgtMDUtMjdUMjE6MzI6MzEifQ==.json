Besides a couple bad words and crude jokes, this movie is one of the best movies ever! A Marvel movie finally beat my expectations! Even after knowing what was gonna happen, I still left the theatre like whoaaaaa.....Awesome movie! Funny, emotional, intense, action packed! I absolutely loved the self-sacrificing theme!! Loved how the characters interacted with each other and their development. Marvel took a risk with the ending but we all knew it was gonna be different than the first films because its Infinity War! It's what we've been waiting for! Gotta go out with a bang. Gotta be realistic!

First, how do you let most of the main characters die including black panther. Makes no sense. Secondly, they go through all of the war and fighting just to disappear by some mysterious leaves. They also didn't explain the characters or planets like the planet knowhere. I thought that that was actually nowhere just like he wasn't going any where. I was very confused that the ending was just everyone dieing. I mean, black panther died in his own home!!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10217228222757188/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-27T19:39:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-27T19:50:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977293770","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977293770"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"May 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie, way to bring it all together.
