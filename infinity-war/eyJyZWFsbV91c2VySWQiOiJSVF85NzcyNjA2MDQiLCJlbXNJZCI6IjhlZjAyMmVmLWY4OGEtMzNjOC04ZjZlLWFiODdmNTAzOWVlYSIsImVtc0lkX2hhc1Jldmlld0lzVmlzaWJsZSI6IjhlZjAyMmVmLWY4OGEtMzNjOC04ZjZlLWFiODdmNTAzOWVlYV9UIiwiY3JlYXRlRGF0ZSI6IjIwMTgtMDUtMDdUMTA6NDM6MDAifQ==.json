This film and its sequel will mark the end of an era and set up the next era of the MCU. Needless to say it has a lot riding on it. So did the film live up to the hype?\n\nLong story short it did. The movie manages to juggle its multitude of characters and storylines skillfully. Even with a certain amount of exposition each scene keeps the energy up and the plot moving along quite nicely. I loved the way they handled the story and how just minutes into the film Thanos asserts his menacing presence and shows that no matter how powerful or how much fans love you can save you from him.\n\nAll in all excellent movie for fans and casual movie goers with a grand scale a little something for everyone.","displayName":"Frei F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T10:36:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T10:47:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"977142461","realm":"RT","displayName":"Frei F","accountLink":"/user/id/977142461"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Over 10 years of marvel, and we are finally here. Despite an incredibly high bar, infinity war manages to surpass expectations. in a movie with so many characters, the russo brothers manage to make you care about every storyline (take a hint Rian Johnson). The villain, thanos, is given the best development of any marvel villain yet, although his motivations will make you shout at the screen in frustration. infinity war will make you laugh, cry, and sit back in awe as a brilliant visual spectacle unfolds. Infinity War is about the characters you love, and will leave you wanting more. For action fans, MCU fans, and fans of fun, this movie is a must-see.","displayName":"Nathanael B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T10:16:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T10:24:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"977260579","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nathanael B","accountLink":"/user/id/977260579"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I really enjoyed this movie.

In spectacular fashion, the Russo brothers deliver. Infinity War will make you laugh, cry, and sit back in awe. The visual effects and soundtrack are flawless, but most importantly, the characters don't disappoint. Your beloved heroes (for the most part) are somehow balanced into a story that keeps you invested. Even with all the hero storylines, the villain, Thanos, is developed more than any villain in MCU history. His motivations are understood perhaps more clearly than any villain yet. Infinity War is fun, painful, and leaves you longing for Part 2. A must-see.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10152356211002928/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T10:00:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T10:08:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"977132113","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977132113"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it Loved it Loved it.
