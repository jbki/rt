This movie had an extreme amount of hype behind it and it definitely delivered and some. The story was great and wasn't afraid to end where it did, the pacing of the movie was perfect, and the characters were well balanced. Everyone had just the right amount of screen time they needed and they were divided into the right groups. Thanos was played excellent and instead of being a mindless brute of destruction typical of most movies nowadays, you really empathize with him.

In order to truly appreciate the decade of work that has gone into this massive undertaking, I strongly recommend seeing every film before stepping foot in the theater. Not only does this help on a surface-level of understanding plot threads and character arcs, but it dives super deep of an emotional ocean that mostly series fans will be able to share. And if you haven't seen anything before Infinity War? Buckle up. This is leaps and bounds beyond anything you've seen on a superhero scale.","displayName":"Lane Z","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T08:05:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-11T11:50:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"906836279","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lane Z","accountLink":"/user/id/906836279"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Infinity War is for the fans, and they will love it.\n\nGenerally, the MCU films are well made, though often cookie-cutter and with few risks taken. Why fix what isn't broken, right? Yet this films takes its characters, the soul of Marvel films, and breaks them, or worse, kills them outright. Those who bear witness feel the consequences. This includes Thanos, who has my vote for the most humanized and interesting villain in the MCU.\n\nIt's not even a proper \"film.\" Citing Ralph Sepe Jr., it's an \"event.\" The cinematic equivalent of an amusement park presentation, except the characters we've come to know for nearly a decade are truly challenged.\n\nThere is a weight that feels more real than prior conflicts, and watching characters rationalize their innate fear gives greater depth to someone like Thor, who over the years was characterized as simply stoic, arrogant, and more recently, charmingly goofy.\n\nFunny enough, the weakest part of Infinity War for me is its humor. Not always bad, but often poorly timed and forced into scenes I wish they weren't.\n\nIf you're not big on Marvel, it's a good action spectacle, but you won't gain much in character development, since it heavily requires the other films for that. It also suffers from some pacing issues, which is almost inevitable considering the scale. Despite that, it doesn't feel at all like a mess.\n\nIf you are another Marvel shill like me...do enjoy. \nIt's one hell of an event.\n\nMarvel Fans - 9 / 10\nNon-Marvel - 7.5 / 10","displayName":"Tom S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T08:05:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T08:07:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"977260454","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tom S","accountLink":"/user/id/977260454"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"}]}
