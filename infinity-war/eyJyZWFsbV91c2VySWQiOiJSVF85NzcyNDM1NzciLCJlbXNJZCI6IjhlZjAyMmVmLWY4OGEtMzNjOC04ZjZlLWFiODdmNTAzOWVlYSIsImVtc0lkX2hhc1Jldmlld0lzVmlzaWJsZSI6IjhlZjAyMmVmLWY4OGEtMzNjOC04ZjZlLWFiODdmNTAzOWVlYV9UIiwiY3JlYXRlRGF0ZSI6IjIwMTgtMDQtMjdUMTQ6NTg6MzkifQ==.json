The most youll get is learning where characters end up after civil war. However, the movie does a great job answering questions about unknowns in the MCU like the infinity stones and thanos. The movie is filled with almost non stop action and because theres so many characters you dont get a lot of character interaction that you were probably hoping for, but does a good job of developing some characters further in this movie. The ending is an absolute cliffhanger and makes you ready to see avengers 4 immediately after and wondering how earths mightiest heroes will deal with the repurcussions of this film. Overall this film is action packed and a thriller all the way through that will blow your mind and make you crave the next movie even more than this one. Also, thanos character is beautifully played in the movie and honestly has become my favorite villain of any movie ever. Cant wait to see him again.","displayName":"James A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T14:55:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T15:06:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243568","realm":"RT","displayName":"James A","accountLink":"/user/id/977243568"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Avengers Infinity War absolutely works!!

Everything wanted was there and probably more. There were a few cringe moments and potential plotholes, but overall, the acting was good, the movie tied its legion of characters together well, and the plot was intriguing. Would suggest.","displayName":"Judge K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T14:53:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T15:00:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"976840839","realm":"RT","displayName":"Judge K","accountLink":"/user/id/976840839"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This one was tough to watch. But amazing. It really stuck with me 24 hours after watching. The last Marvel movie that happened to was Winter Soldier, still my favorite until IW. The story was surprising, the smaller groups was well put together. The larger battle was exciting and kept you on the edge of your seat. \n\nFrom the opening scene, you knew any character could die at any time. It kept you uneasy and knew the stakes were high. \n\nThanos is imposing not only physically, he is mentally superior. He does have a purpose, no matter how twisted it is, it makes sense. Those are the best villains. The ones who think they are morally correct. Props to Josh Brolin and the Cagi magicians behind creating this character. He was very believable. \n\nRDJ always is great, but Chris Hemmsworth stood out as his redefined Thor. He really was a lot of fun and again proved his might. His new weapon is no Mjolnor but I like it. I am mad at Star Lord, but I get it, sort of. Spidey and Dr. Strange are fantastic too. I may have started crushing again on Scarlet Johansson.","displayName":"Ron K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/512760805/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T14:53:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T00:59:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"843810811","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ron K","accountLink":"/user/id/843810811"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie!
