However, I feel like it may have been a little rushed. Overall the action scenes were great and well choreographed, while the emotional parts were well planned out and timed to fit correctly.

Great movie, cant't wait for part 2.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/451080345320768/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-13T01:03:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-13T01:10:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"977266673","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977266673"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie.
