If you love action, you'll get action! It's not all action, though. There are some great emotional scenes that really hit the viewers. The battles are GREAT and Thanos is such an interesting character. I love him so much. Marvel did a great job. I DONT KNOW WHY THIS MOVIE HAS A LESSER SCORE THAN TGE LAST JEDI. The last Jedi was just ok. But it receives a 91?!?! What an outrage! And this movie is so good! It at least deserves a 90! Overall, Avengers Infinity War is probably my favorite Marvel movie. I might need to watch it again. It's just that good!","displayName":"Josue D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T05:12:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T05:16:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"976314208","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josue D","accountLink":"/user/id/976314208"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"100% THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE.

Marvel wants you to see this on the biggest screen possible and it's worth doing so, as the massive set pieces fill the screen with great scope and inventive thrills that build on what has been built from its previous movies.  The collaboration behind these movies are one of the films strongest aspects as the filmmakers play with the established traits and worlds of other movies, making previous films even more essential viewing, so there will be those feeling left out as this is a big love letter to the fans. Massive set pieces use the powers and abilities of our heroes so creatively they very much deserve the cheers and smiles they are sure to trigger. The Russo Brothers do a good job of giving us insight and plenty of screen time with the menacing villain who genuinely garners fear in the scenes he faces our heroes in. The massive cast all get their moments, with even the new villainous henchman getting valid inclusions, which are a lot of fun. The massive set of heroes inevitably means some will have lesser parts than others (some more surprising than others) which also means while they do all get some emotional payoffs we don't get the full character arcs previous films did greats jobs at building. The story is light but like a big TV show finale, Infinity War ticks its plot points off one by one as it pulls out all the stops with gasps and big story turns that are sure to keep fans coming for at least its next big three projects.","displayName":"David O","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/746950608/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T05:09:16.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-14T18:12:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"892230410","realm":"RT","displayName":"David O","accountLink":"/user/id/892230410"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"makes you want too see the end.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T05:09:03.865Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T05:09:03.865Z","user":{"userId":"970391524","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/970391524"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Super Heroes not my favourite genre but it was quite funny and I love Robert Downey Jnr and of course some eye candy Chris Hemsworth ??","displayName":"Lesley C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1535070466/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T05:08:32.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T19:59:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"839815488","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lesley C","accountLink":"/user/id/839815488"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
