It was 10 years in the making (Iron Man '08). Ive literally had dreams of being at the theater about to watch this movie for years now. It did not only meet expectations, but shattered them and said \"How dare you for thinking this movie is only gonna be an A in you're book. You knew it would be 200/100.\" The first 10 mins of the movie feel like a Thanos comic, Jesus Christ Brolin is chilling as The Mad Titan. The  execution regarding the various characters and their screentime is brilliant. I've never seen as smooth of transitions like I saw in this movie. Seen it 3 times, and plan to go atleast once more. Thank you Russo Brothers, Kevin Fiege & everyone else at Marvel for caring so much about the fact that a lot of ppl including myself, would simply just like to see their favorite comics and characters come to the big screen w/ care like they should!!!! WE DONT GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THIS \"SUPERHERO FATIGUE\" ITS A MYTH.
