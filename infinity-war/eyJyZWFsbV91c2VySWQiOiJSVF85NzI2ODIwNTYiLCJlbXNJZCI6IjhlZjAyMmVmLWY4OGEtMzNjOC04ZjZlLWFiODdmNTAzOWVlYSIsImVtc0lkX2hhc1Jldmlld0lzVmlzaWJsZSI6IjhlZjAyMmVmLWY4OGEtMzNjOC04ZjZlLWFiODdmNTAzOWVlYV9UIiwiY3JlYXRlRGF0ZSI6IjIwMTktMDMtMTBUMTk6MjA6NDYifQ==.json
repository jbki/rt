I think I have seen it several times. I am more of a DC fan but I saw it three times in the theater and countless times at home. It's memorable. It's going to last a long time. It did what it set out to do and frankly I am not sure how Marvel can top it.

It manages to juggle so many characters while still delivering an engaging story that had me gripped all the way through. The action and the effects were great as always, and Thanos was probably one of the best villains this franchise has had. The ending was amazing and I'm quite excited for the next one. 9/10","displayName":"Langley E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-10T15:04:40.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-10T15:09:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"977907543","realm":"RT","displayName":"Langley E","accountLink":"/user/id/977907543"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Brilliant movie that \"subverted expectations\".","displayName":"Sam S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-10T12:31:11.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-10T12:31:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"970952518","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sam S","accountLink":"/user/id/970952518"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Very good movie, but I actually prefer Captain Marvel","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/151850018767442/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-10T11:35:30.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-10T11:35:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"976865118","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976865118"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie did a great job of bringing together a massive amount of heroes and characters. It was definitely a return to form compared to the previous movie in the series. The villain was well written and the entire cast performed well. I was slightly annoyed by the actions of Star-Lord, who did something unimaginably stupid for whatever reason. Overall, this film will also be remembered as a great one, given its huge splash in pop culture and social media.","displayName":"Martin E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-10T11:33:58.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-10T11:34:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"977882144","realm":"RT","displayName":"Martin E","accountLink":"/user/id/977882144"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing movie.
