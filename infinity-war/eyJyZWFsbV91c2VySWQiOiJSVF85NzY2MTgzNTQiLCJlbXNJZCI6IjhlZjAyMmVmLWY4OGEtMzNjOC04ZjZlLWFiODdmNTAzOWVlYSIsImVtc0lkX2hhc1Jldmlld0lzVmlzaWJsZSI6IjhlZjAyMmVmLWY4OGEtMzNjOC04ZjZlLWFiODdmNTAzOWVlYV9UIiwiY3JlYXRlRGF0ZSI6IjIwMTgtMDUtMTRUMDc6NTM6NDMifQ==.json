This wasn’t just your typical hero against villain fighting movie, there was a lot of story to this and all of the characters had their moments. Josh Brolin as Thanos was just so good. He’s the best villain out of these Marvel movies. Even though you were terrified of him, there was a logic to his madness and you sympathized with him. There are a lot of theories out as to what will will happen in the sequel due to be released next year. It’s fun to read but that’s a long wait, but at least we have Ant-Man and the Wasp in July.

The story and plot had meaning and  conisquences for everything. All the heroes do great again as usual but the villain Thanos was extremely well done. He is given lots of screen time and was very well developed. The story moves in a much darker pace and end leaving a gut wrenching feeling. Lots of fun, do not miss.","displayName":"Caleb B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-14T07:38:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-14T07:40:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"977100463","realm":"RT","displayName":"Caleb B","accountLink":"/user/id/977100463"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The script is just bad writing. take loki for example.
