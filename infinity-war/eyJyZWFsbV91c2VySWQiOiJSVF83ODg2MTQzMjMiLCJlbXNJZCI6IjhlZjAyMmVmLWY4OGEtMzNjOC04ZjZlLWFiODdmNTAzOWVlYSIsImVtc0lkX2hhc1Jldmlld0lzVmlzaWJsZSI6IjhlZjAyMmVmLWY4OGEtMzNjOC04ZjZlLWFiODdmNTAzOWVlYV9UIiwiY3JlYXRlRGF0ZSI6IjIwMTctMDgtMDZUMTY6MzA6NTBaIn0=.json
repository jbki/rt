It should have  been a 2 part film because there are just two many great character  arcs to put into one movie.

It’s fun, exciting, intense, nostalgic, and emotional. Plenty of action, humor (sometimes a bit too much though), and VERY impressive visuals. I’d say skip on the Real D 3D and see it in IMAX. The only thing needed to truly enjoy this movie for everything it offers is watching all the marvel films so far - for this movie, there is one that you don’t have to see beforehand ;) But wow, 10 years of building up, and this skyscraper stands tall! Hopefully the critics give it more credit because it definitely deserves to be in the 95%+ range. I read through the critic reviews on Flixster... wow. There are some VERY idiotic critics out there. Some reviews even gave me the impression that they didn’t even see the movie! 84% is very surprising, and definitely unbalanced compared to their reviews for other movies. So trust me, the fact that I want to see it again and want to have it on 4K to watch it at home right this second just shows how thrilling this was. Go watch it, and have fun!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-23T08:25:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T18:41:46.509Z","user":{"userId":"930481640","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/930481640"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 23, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Probably the best avengers to date.
