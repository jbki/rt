I wasn’t “wrecked” at the ending (this isn’t Sophie’s Choice), and came away feeling as if the film had no discernible personality compared to a number of the previous Marvel films. Action? Yes. “Vistas?” (Albeit cg vistas) Yes. Drama? Maybe in the beginning and probably somewhere in the middle but by then I was bored enough to not notice. The absolute shining accomplishment of this film is Thanos which has been written and portrayed exquisitely and ranks up there with Anton Chigurh or Hans Landa in film villains, in my opinion.
