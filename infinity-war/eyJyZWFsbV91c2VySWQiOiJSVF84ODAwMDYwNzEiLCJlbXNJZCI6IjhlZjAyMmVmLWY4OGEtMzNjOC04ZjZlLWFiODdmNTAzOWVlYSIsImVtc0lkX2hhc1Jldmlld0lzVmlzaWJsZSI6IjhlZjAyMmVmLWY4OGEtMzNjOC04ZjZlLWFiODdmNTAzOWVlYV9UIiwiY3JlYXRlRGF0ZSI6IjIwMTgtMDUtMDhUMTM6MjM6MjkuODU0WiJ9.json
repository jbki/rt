This is still yet another cog in the giant money making wheel, but there is enough true storytelling and craft to justify the behemoth. The business side of the MCU keeps the stakes of our beloved heroes not as severe as they would like. Knowledge of both a part two as well future episodes of individual franchises keeps the cliffhanger in check. \nThanos is a fantastic villain and his CGI rendering is great. Looking forward to what comes next.","displayName":"Pete T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10158688723200416/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T11:29:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-08T11:29:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"784317500","realm":"RT","displayName":"Pete T","accountLink":"/user/id/784317500"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing. The culmination of 10 years of story telling, character development, and action. Heart wrenching, uplifting, inspirational, awe inspiring, I could go on. The story makes sense, the pacing is on point, the dramatic beats hit at the right times, the cgi is well done, the performances are spot on, I don't see how any of these so called 'critics' could not like this film. If you don't like this, go crowd-fund a sequel for Mother or crawl back under the covers with your favorite unicorn inspired romance novel.","displayName":"Fletcher K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T11:28:14.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-08T11:33:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"908337265","realm":"RT","displayName":"Fletcher K","accountLink":"/user/id/908337265"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Marvel movie till now.
