Thanos is well present as a mad Titan as he is one of most powerful marvel movie villain till this date and is the only villain that breaks Marvels bad villain curse because you can see during the movie what chaos he can actually bring to the universe.All the characters are given as much of screen time they can get but truly own each scene they are in, unfortunately, All of the characters split up into teams for the majority this film but the meet up at one point or another.\n\nI would highly recommend this movie to everyone, please bring a box of tissues to Avengers Infinity War because this is truly a culmination of the 19 films that came before.","displayName":"Branden B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T11:36:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T11:38:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246156","realm":"RT","displayName":"Branden B","accountLink":"/user/id/977246156"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Movie Ever!!!!

I can say with some relief that it largely succeeds at both realizing its ambitions and earning its runtime. This is a fast-paced film with relatively little downtime, if we compare it to the first avengers film for example, the amount of action roughly triples. What few scenes we do have between characters are not wasted, though there is an abundance of quippy dialogue here as usual, Infinity War makes the smart choice not to undercut every emotionally resonant scene in the film, a major stumbling point for Taika Waititi's wildly entertaining but emotionally stunted Thor: Ragnarok. The amount of mileage you get out of this film with depend greatly on why you like Marvel films (or if you even do) and also on how many of the previous films you've seen, having seen all of them there were references to past events and inside jokes all over the place that I enjoyed immensely but might leave others scratching their heads. I'll break the film up into categories in this review to give a better sense of organization to this review.\n\nPlot (spoiler free): As previously mentioned this film is a culmination of events, spanning 18 previous films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, thankfully Infinity War does not try to shoehorn in too much from these previous films and sticks with the main point of conflict that they have been slowly alluding over the course of these films, Thanos. Nothing really serves to distract from the threat Thanos poses here, everything rightly takes a backseat to the Mad Titan and we see a great deal of him in this film, this serves the story well, Marvel finally has a villain worthy of their heroes, which they have mostly been lacking up till this point with the exception of Killmonger. Almost every Marvel hero is here with a few exceptions which I won't spoil for you, while there are some great hero moments in this film they take a distinctive backseat to Thanos himself which I felt was an excellent choice, our heroes are all well established at this point but despite so much buzz about Thanos he remains mostly a mystery going into this film. The slow reveal of just who Thanos is that is fully realized with the ending of the film really seals the deal here. I'm aware this is a very vague commentary on the plot but I can't do much better without spoiling everything that happens so just take my word for it, it is thoughtfully and methodically planned out, some of the character decisions seem unreasonable at first but are explained later, and some others are not so well explained and seem out of character, but overall the plot is cohesive and satisfying and emotionally resonant if you have come to identify with any of these characters over the past decade of Marvel films.\n\nCharacters/Acting: This is possibly the biggest stumbling block for this movie for me. Some of the characters which have been built up in other films don't translate into this film as well as I'd have hoped, that is to say, sometimes their lines and actions just don't quite line up with what I think they would do based on how they are portrayed in other films. That said this is fairly minor except in a few places where it just seemed lazy and really made me question the characters legitimacy. The acting is a reflection of how well cast these characters are, almost everyone embodies their role effortlessly, Josh Brolin's Thanos is particularly striking in this film as well as RDJ's continued excellence as Iron Man.\n\nCGI: All top notch, and it needs to be because there is an absolute ton of it, especially considering the effects going into rendering Thanos as a believable entity it is an amazing technical achievement, there are pieces here and there where something doesn't move quite right or dips just a little too far into the uncanny valley for comfort but overall a strong showing that is gorgeous to watch unfold.\n\nCostume/Set Design: We go to a lot of different planets and locations throughout the film and they are all made to look distinct from one another and not just in an, ice planet, fire planet, sort of way, a lot of detail is put into each to give them a sense of history and size beyond what we see onscreen. Not all of the costumes change but those that do tend to embrace darker colors to reflect the tone the film is going for, there are also some cool additional tools at the heroes disposal that integrated really well into the film.\n\nCinematography: This is ok, there are some stunning establishing shots but I think it has more to do with the uniqueness of the settings than the camera work, I personally didn't notice anything particularly noteworthy about the cinematography on the first viewing.\n\nFight Choreography: As usual for Marvel, they do a great job not just of highlighting individual heroes powers during a fight but integrating them into combination attacks with other powers, it's an absolute blast to watch unfold on screen. There are a few times where things are happening so quickly and the camera is so tight on the action it can be hard to really make sense of what's going on but this is rare and in one case it actually fits the scene for things to be just a mess.\n\nConclusion: This is a really well-made film that Marvel clearly spent a lot of time building up to and they almost completely nailed it, the few issues I noticed in both the script and the presentation are insignificant except for one big thing which I will go into in spoilers below. But even that didn't stop me from thoroughly enjoyed just about every minute of this two and a half hour monster of a film. If you like Marvel movies you will like this movie. If you don't why the hell did you read this long ass review?\n\nThe Big Problem (Spoilers below):\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThanos repeatedly uses the hero's love for one another against them, he uses it to directly acquire multiple infinity stones. First with Loki by almost killing Thor, then with Quill's inability to kill Gamora, then by torturing Nebula to get the soul stone's location out of Gamora, then by Wanda (Scarlet Witch) not being willing to go through with killing Vision until it's too late. My problem is not that the characters have emotional attachments my problem is that this theme is crazy obvious to the point where by the third time this happened I was rolling my eyes, it's not a unique theme here and honestly they chose some really bad pairings for this to get the audience invested in the choice, Vision and Wanda are barely established before this film as lovers so it's hard to really buy into, Loki and Thor have one of the more complicated relationships in the MCU and Loki's guile is all but absent, Nebula and Gamora is probably the most believable one after the events of Guardians Vol. 2 but even that falls flat if you haven't seen that movie. Gamora and Quill is also well established but is undercut by the fact that Thanos would never have let Quill kill her anyway, this is even used against Quill again later to prevent Thanos from using the gauntlet. My point is just that without a solid investment in these relationships it can be hard to get behind the characters in these moments, they can appear selfish and short-sighted rather than sympathetic. On the flip side when Thanos actually does make a sacrifice, the same kind he's been demanding of his enemies the whole time in order to stop him, that is very impactful and give the theme a little more legitimacy. Given how much the Avengers lose at the end due to their refusal to make sacrifices it makes me wonder what they will have to resort to in the sequel to make things right, or if they even can. Despite my gripes about how the film chooses to portray this weakness I still think it's a very compelling question to raise, one that I honestly didn't think Marvel would have the balls to go through with. What happens when the bad guys win? I'm sure we'll find out next May.","displayName":"James C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/729136933/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T11:33:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T11:36:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"788685913","realm":"RT","displayName":"James C","accountLink":"/user/id/788685913"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"An ambitious crossover that takes  major elements from all the MCU films to date, and yet manages to  harmonize them into a  jam-packed, yet surprisingly uncluttered mega blockbuster that still leaves you wanting for more!
