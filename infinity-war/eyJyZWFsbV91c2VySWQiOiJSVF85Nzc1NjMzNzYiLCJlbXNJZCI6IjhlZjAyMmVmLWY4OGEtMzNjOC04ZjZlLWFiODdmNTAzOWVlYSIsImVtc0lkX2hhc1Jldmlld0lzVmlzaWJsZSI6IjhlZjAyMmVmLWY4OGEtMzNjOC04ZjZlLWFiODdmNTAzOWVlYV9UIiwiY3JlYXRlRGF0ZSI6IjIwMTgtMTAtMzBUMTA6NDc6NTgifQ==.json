Asides from the agonizing yearning for more, Infinity War is one of the best Marvel produced in ages. There's no dull moment for every minute is action-packed and the few scenes that aren't are emotionally resonant. Zoe Saldana's brilliant performance made Gamora's story a lot more touching than it needed to be. In fact the entire cast truly outdid themselves and gave it their all. As the culmination of a 1o year journey approaches, the upcoming Avengers movie could be the ultimate MCU blockbuster topping even this one.","displayName":"Farah R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1137866045/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-29T06:57:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-29T07:03:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"916050255","realm":"RT","displayName":"Farah R","accountLink":"/user/id/916050255"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Una pelicula sobrevalorada, Que no entiendes a menos que te veas todo el ucm, Es una total perdida de tiempo y en serio...

Marvel adopts darker tone and uses it correctly (unlike DCEU). There are at least 3 things that made this installment interesting for me:\n1. Making Thanos main character (at least in his own eyes) and charismatic villain (unlike most of other MCU villains)\n2. Smart decision to split characters into a few groups - it provides enough screen time for each one without overabundance, plus creates interesting interactions\n3. Amazing score. Alan Silvestri is at his best, plus they incorporated the most memorable themes from the other MCU movies (Black Panther, The First Avenger, The Avengers, Guardians).\nThe only problem with Infinity War is that it would be very hard for Marvel to top that.","displayName":"Alex F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-27T01:32:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-27T01:45:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"977021663","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex F","accountLink":"/user/id/977021663"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great addition to a stunningly unviverse so perfectly crafted.
