Too much action, characters....everything. Not only are there continuity problems starting from the FIRST scene, Thanos is not very convincing and his plan makes no sense, many characters get less than 3 minutes of screen time and some parts of the movie drag somehow. You'd think for a movie that needs to fit so much into 2 and half hours they wouldn't bother with stupid scenes that are there for humor. I originally rated this movie higher than what I do now, but really, if you somehow haven't seen it, don't waste your time, at least until the second part comes out, then you'll have to watch this out of obligation.","displayName":"Destiny S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T19:16:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-03T12:32:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"976583813","realm":"RT","displayName":"Destiny S","accountLink":"/user/id/976583813"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"best Marvel movie ever.

Pay attention to the directors of this movie because  Avengers Infinity War is just so awesome. Congrats Anthony and Joe Russo. You made a hell of movie. Justice League did not come  even close. I don't what to spoil the movie so I'm not going into details other than to say this movie is an Epic blockbuster movie with a great story line, featuring great performances from our beloved heroes notably  Iron Man, Thor and Captain America. It is well balance despite the shear number of heroes that take part in this movie. It also feature a strong antagonist/villain with his own back-story.  The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.
