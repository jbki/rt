Figuratively can be seen as the eternal fight of all beings against the Destiny. Someone thinks we live in a universe with rules which cannot be broken because they define the reality itself, others think instead that life can be perceived in new ways, going beyond those rules. And so here it is the conflict, nay an interior conflict of the dark hero Thanos, obsessed with knowledge. I repeat myself: it is an epic story present in everyone's life.","displayName":"Mr S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-19T16:00:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-19T16:23:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"977479079","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mr S","accountLink":"/user/id/977479079"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It was a good movie nothing to special . Definitely over-hyped. If you have not seen the movies before this one you have to watch it to understand what is going on. I had the watched all the movies that came before it, but it I was still confused sometimes, so I had to re-watch the previous movies and then watch it. Overall good movie, but nothing special about it except for the fact they finally got almost every character in the movie.","displayName":"sahl m","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-19T11:40:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-19T11:44:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"977483776","realm":"RT","displayName":"sahl m","accountLink":"/user/id/977483776"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie has got me so hyped up, that I have seen every single Marvel movie 3 times.
