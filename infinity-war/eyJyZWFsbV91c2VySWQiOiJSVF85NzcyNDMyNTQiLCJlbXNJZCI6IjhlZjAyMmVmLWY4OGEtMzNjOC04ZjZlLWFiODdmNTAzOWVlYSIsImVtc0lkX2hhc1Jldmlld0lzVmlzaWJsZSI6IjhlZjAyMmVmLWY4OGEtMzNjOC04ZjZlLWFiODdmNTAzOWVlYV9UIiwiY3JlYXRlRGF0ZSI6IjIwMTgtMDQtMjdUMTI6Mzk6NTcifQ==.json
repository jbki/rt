The motivation for this stupidity is poor. The battle scene makes no sense from a military strategic point of view either.\nVisually stunning except for the comps of Banner in Hulk Smasher and some environment comps. But generally visually stunning.","displayName":"Dik T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/275773062790655/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T12:37:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T12:41:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"975098590","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dik T","accountLink":"/user/id/975098590"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"BEST Mcu movie yet!!!!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10152352257670926/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T12:37:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T12:37:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"976676296","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976676296"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Avoid the internet and go see it.

Our love for the characters drives us for more. Infinity War is the movie that proves regardless how super the characters are they are still mortal. Thanos proves that with a snap of a finger our beloved heroes can just vanish. The movie gives you the feeling of lost and hope but yet you cling on that small faith that they will prevail. Definately an emotional roller coaster that breaks the mold. Exciting, upsetting, crazy and entertaining. Elements that makes this movie 5 stars. Watch it for the beloved heroes.","displayName":"Butch L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T12:35:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T12:42:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243245","realm":"RT","displayName":"Butch L","accountLink":"/user/id/977243245"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's fresh to watch.
