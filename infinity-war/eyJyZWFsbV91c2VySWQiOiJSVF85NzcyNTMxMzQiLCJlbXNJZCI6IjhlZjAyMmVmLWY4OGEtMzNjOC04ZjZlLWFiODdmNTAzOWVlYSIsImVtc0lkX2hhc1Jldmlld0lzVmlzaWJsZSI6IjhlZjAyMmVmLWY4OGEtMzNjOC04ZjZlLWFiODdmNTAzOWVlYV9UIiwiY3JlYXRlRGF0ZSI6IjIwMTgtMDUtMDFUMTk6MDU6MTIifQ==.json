Its more like a novel  adaptation dress up as a superhero movie with convoluted plot, overused of cgi, too much destruction,weak villains and that includes thanos. And speaking of thanos, hes really out of character. Hes like hes trying to be noble but hes not and he doesn't have a clear motive. Hes just a big cgi generic villain just like most of marvels previous villains. Some of the characters are really out of character too. The relationship between Wanda and Vision, Gamora and Peter are bland.The movie is also too long.Overall, the movie is big pile of mess.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1581396001909740/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T19:04:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T19:20:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"977085072","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977085072"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Definitely recomend√≥","displayName":"Anthony H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T18:57:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T18:58:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"937164637","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anthony H","accountLink":"/user/id/937164637"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Pretty good interpretation of classic comic story.","displayName":"Eric S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T18:48:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T18:54:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"977253114","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eric S","accountLink":"/user/id/977253114"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie!

Seeing this on opening night with a theater packed full of fans was definitely the way to see it but it also highlighted the very bold (some might say questionable) way that it plays out. For 90% of the film it had us all smiling, cheering, and griping our seats with tension. It was both playful and thrilling which is typically a winning formula for a summer blockbuster if you nail the mix of those perfect - and they did - until that ending came along.\n\nThat ending.\n\nWith the snap of his finger Thanos destroys half of all life in the universe and we tragically watch as heroes we know and love turn to dust one by one. And then it ends.\n\nSure, we get a post credits scene that delivers more of this followed by a tiny glimmer of hope, but overall the vibe in the theater was still really weird. I fully expected the movie to end with our theater bursting into rapturous applause but instead there was nothing but shocked murmurs and the memory of people screaming, \"FUCK!\" when their favorite heroes turned to dust.\n\nAs an episode of TV this might have been a brilliant way to end things but for a 2.5 hour film that already took us through a roller coaster of emotions it can't help but feel a little incomplete. I was especially troubled by this after so many comments from Joe and Anthony Russo claiming that this will be a complete, satisfying movie than can stand alone from next year's untitled sequel. Sorry boys, but I'm going to have to call bullshit on that.\n\nIt was also tough to be fully affected by the ending when in just the past week reps from Marvel/Disney and Sony have talked about planning sequels for both Spider-Man and Black Panther. I know we would have found it hard to believe those characters are gone for good no matter what but a little more discretion on future plans could have gone a long way to adding gravitas to this film.\n\nGripes about the ending (and the odd choice of stripping Bruce's ability to Hulk out) aside, the film is an otherwise remarkable achievement. The sheer balancing act of managing every single one of these characters and their motivations is a mind-boggling screenwriting feat and should not be understated. The performances are sterling across the board and the visuals pop in all of their comic book glory.\n\nIt may not be Marvel Studio's greatest work but they've now set the table for Avengers 4 to be the most glorious piece of geek wonderment ever made. Here's hoping they don't let us down!","displayName":"Matt D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/5320086/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T18:19:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-12T22:33:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"783418767","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt D","accountLink":"/user/id/783418767"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"After seeing the Black Panther I was very disappointed. should've waited for DVD.
