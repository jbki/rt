This is a cameo fest with no plot, no suspense, and generic action scenes.  Aside from a couple humerous moments, this movie is a snoozer.  I think I'm done with Avengers; too many heroes just means no plot or character development.  I'll wait for the single hero movies like Black Panther and Spiderman: Homecoming instead.","displayName":"Jack H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-01T22:46:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-01T22:50:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"977302368","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jack H","accountLink":"/user/id/977302368"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A great movie for all to see, including those who aren't usually fans of superhero movies.\n\nA great cast of actors and characters with a deeply engaging and thought-provoking story that had great writing contributes to the success of this movie.\n\nNon stop action and plot without getting totally cheesy or too violent.

I understand this isnt the end of the journey, but most films have some sort of hope, or some sense of a small victory between them, there isn't at all with Infinity War. Save the $12, not worth it in the end.\n\nThe 2.5 stars I give this film are entirely for actors / and the visuals of it all. Zero for the writing of this film. The only plot here is various avengers getting beat on various plants.
