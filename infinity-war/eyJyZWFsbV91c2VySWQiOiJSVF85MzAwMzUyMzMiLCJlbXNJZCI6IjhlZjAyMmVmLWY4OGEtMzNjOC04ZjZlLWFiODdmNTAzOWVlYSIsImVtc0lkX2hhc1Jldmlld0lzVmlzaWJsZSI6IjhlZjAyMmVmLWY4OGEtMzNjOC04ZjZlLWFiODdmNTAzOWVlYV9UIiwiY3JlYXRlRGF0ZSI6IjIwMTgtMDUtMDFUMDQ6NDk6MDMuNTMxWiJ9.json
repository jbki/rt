I remember 10 years ago standing at the Marvel booth at Comic Con International as Marvel Studios announced Captain America as they showed Captain Americas shield, Thor's hammer Mjolnir and a life size movie replica of the Infinity Gauntlet. That's when fans new we were in for something epic and it has finally arrived in the form of the first part of this two part story. Infinity War is an amazing movie and although it takes liberties due to not being able to use the usual characters such as Silver Surfer or Adam Warlock or even the Fantastic Four ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T04:48:09.275Z","updateDate":"2018-05-24T05:58:48.147Z","user":{"userId":"844711472","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/844711472"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Brilliant! Any reviewer saying relies on the previous films missed the point entirely; stop ignoring the fact its part of something larger. Seems to be a clear difference in the older aged not being able to process or keep up with the pacing, it's not confusing in the slightest.

Bringing together all their assets on a single rodeo was definitely quite a challenge for the writers, directors & actors alike. But as they have gotten us used to it, they have outperformed our expectations in this movie. This time they have brought us the best foe Marvel studios had yet to produce. A tyranic maniac, obsessed with his own legend, on a quest to become god. (spoiler)He actually kinda pulls it off at the end of the movie. The other characters were all so beautifully intigrated in the movie, with each, & i mean each character taking on an adequate & specific role very well designed for every actor. Drama in the MCU has reached its peak with this movie, where it's not only about kicking ass & falling out in between characters. This is by far the best Avenger movie we've seen yet, maybe even the best marvel comic adaptation. Can't wait to see the sequel.","displayName":"ezz e","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T04:24:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T04:36:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"977215315","realm":"RT","displayName":"ezz e","accountLink":"/user/id/977215315"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Loved this film! Avengers Infinity War was a bold, thrilling film which shattered the standard Marvel template of predictability. Every five minutes, they'd shock you, and introduce new, intriguing elements that heighten the tension and the story. The villain was extremely well made (CGI-wise and character-wise) and even one of the co-villains, Ebony Maw was extremely interesting and intriguing. Marvel actually took the odds of this war into account, acknowledging the fact that no way the heroes stood a chance against this guy. They built up tension and dread from the first second of the movie on while keeping some hilarious comedy and great one-liners which did not ruin the mood of the movie. The only flaw would be that some characters had their amazing, fleshed-out moments, while shockingly, other extremely important characters did not live up to their true emotional or story-wise potential. I wouldn't fuss much about this flaw, knowing that there were a lot of characters to begin with on this film, so I easily rate it 4.5/5","displayName":"Melena W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T04:23:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T04:33:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"977148500","realm":"RT","displayName":"Melena W","accountLink":"/user/id/977148500"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Worth the wait.

It's astonishing that Marvel managed to do such an amazing work with the biggest odds against them. Thanos exceeded my expectations. All actors were great. The action scemes were fantastic.
