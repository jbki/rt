Ten years ago, when the MCU was born, The Dark Knight came out and DC had by far the upper hand and the higher ground. And now this film could very well be the end of the DCEU.  It is everything a supethero fan could wish for and it is even better than The Avengers. If you know the DCU, go see right now.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10156328582744304/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T13:43:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T14:14:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246446","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977246446"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Not the strongest film in the franchise and it is the cliff hangar we expected, but good!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T13:42:02.533Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T13:42:02.533Z","user":{"userId":"969474994","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/969474994"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A M A Z I N G ! ! ! ! ! ! !
