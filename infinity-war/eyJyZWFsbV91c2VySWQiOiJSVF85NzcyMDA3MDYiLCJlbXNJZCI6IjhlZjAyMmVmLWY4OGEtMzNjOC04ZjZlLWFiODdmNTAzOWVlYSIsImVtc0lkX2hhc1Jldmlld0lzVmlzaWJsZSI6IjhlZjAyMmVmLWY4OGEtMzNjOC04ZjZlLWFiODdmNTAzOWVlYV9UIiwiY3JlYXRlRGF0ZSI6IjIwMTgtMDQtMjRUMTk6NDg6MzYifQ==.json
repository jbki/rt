The action sequences are anything a fan could ask for. There is nothing better than wanting to see this movie in a crowded theater.

Well done Marvel.","displayName":"Alex A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T19:01:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T06:47:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"977088082","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex A","accountLink":"/user/id/977088082"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great story telling and action packed all into one, Thanos gives everyone a reason to hate him, best marvel villain.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T18:54:35.280Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T03:19:35.572Z","user":{"userId":"976517310","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976517310"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, 'Avengers: Infinity War' may be one of the most ambitious films ever made. The coming together of all of these characters deserve the recognition. But is the film as successfully creative as it is grand? The answer is: kind of. Although the film brings this amount characters together in the most nuanced way possible, it seems as if most of the heroes were undercut and left with nothing to do. The film, with its 2 1/2 hour run time, feels rushed, yet achingly long at the same time; the pacing is one component of this film that is a major problem. The film also introduces plot points that never pay off by the end, the cgi, for the most part, is not very off putting, and the cgi characters looked somewhat authentic, and the comedy hit almost every time, even though the script has our characters repeating and recycling jokes from prior films. All of these faults, though, do not compare to one of the biggest problems of 'Avengers: Infinity War': the villain. Thanos, as menacing as he is, has some of the worst character motivations of any villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The reasoning behind his actions baffles the brain, and leaves questioning his character as a whole. In conclusion, 'Avengers: Infinity War' is a spectacle that all comic book fans need to experience, even though the film is chalk full of plot holes, pacing problems, characters that do not contribute to the overall story, stakes that will not have much lasting affects, and a terrible villain.","displayName":"Roman N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T18:47:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T05:41:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"966933346","realm":"RT","displayName":"Roman N","accountLink":"/user/id/966933346"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Visual clutter, jumbled mess.

I can relate to those who have no real vested interest in these characters. It's a long, confusing, space war movie with cool special effects. But to the true fans who knew almost exactly what to expect, or knew what or whom they were seeing; this film is a modern masterpiece. The magnum opus of the MCU. What other superhero movie in a universe known to be free of consequence could invoke such a broad dynamic of emotion? I am a grown man,  jaded to most things in this world, and I shed more tears for this film than any other. I also loved the humor. There were times when I couldn't help but belt out a hearty HA much to my embarrassment. But at times I could hear a symphony of noses sniffling behind me. This one may be hard for young children, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't see it.  I saw it standard, but now I know that I need to see this in IMAX before the opportunity is lost forever. If I could give it 6 stars, I would. Don't wear makeup to this one.","displayName":"Brian S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/281015568980204/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T18:45:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T09:25:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"975968215","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian S","accountLink":"/user/id/975968215"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie I enjoyed it","displayName":"Marcus%20 R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T18:40:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-24T18:41:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"977236247","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marcus%20 R","accountLink":"/user/id/977236247"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"All this build up was worth the wait!!!
