Non stop action with a great story keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire movie. This one will pull on your heart strings so be prepared. This movie does not seem at all to be 2 1/2 hours long as it flew by. If you have not seen this movie yet, GO SEE IT. It helps though to watch many of Marvels previous movies ( Like Avengers, Cap America, Iron man, Guardians of the Galaxy & Thor). If you do, this movie will effect you. If you go in not knowing any of the characters, you will not be as emotionally involved. This went beyond my expectations and There is one downside though.... YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED YOU HAVE TO WAIT A WHOLE YEAR TO WATCH PART II :).....","displayName":"Chris B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/521520165/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T00:17:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T00:21:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"872386280","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris B","accountLink":"/user/id/872386280"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie!!!!
