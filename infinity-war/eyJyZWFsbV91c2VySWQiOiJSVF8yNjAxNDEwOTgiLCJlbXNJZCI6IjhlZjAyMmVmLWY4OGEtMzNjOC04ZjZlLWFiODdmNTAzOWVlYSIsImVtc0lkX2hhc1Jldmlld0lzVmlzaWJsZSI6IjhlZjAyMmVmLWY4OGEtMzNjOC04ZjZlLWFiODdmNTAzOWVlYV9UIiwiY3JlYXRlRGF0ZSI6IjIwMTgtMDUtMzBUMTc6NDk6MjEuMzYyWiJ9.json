Easily a top 3 MCU movie (I'd put it right after Iron Man 1 and Avengers 1). Obviously being part 1 of a 2 part movie process, there is more to come. But I can tell you the Russo Brothers pulled it off. Thanos lives up to the hype and 10 years of world building is payed off. While not every character you love in the MCU gets a ton of screen time, they all play a necessary role in completing this epic story. I can't believe I have to wait a full year to see how this tale is complete.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-30T17:37:20.401Z","updateDate":"2018-05-30T17:37:20.401Z","user":{"userId":"976930993","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976930993"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Everything about this movie was just amazing.

Each MCU movie starting all the way with iron man has been leading to this, right when nick fury broke into tony starks house talking about the avengers was the first step and it was all leading here to the end. The story juggles almost every character introduced in the mcu in this movie(those who were not will for sure show up next year) as they find out about the master plan of the mad titian thanos as he looks to wipe out half of the universe. The star of this movie is thanos who is maybe the best cbm villain beating out heath ledgers joker as his motives are somewhat heroic but insane he is as frighting as he is interesting and sympathetic 10 years for him was well worth the wait. The rest of the characters play off each other well and add complex to the story as we do feel like the weight of everything is on the line in this film. The humor of the mcu is also not lost. First timers to the mcu will come to love these characters as well, and like everyone the haunting ending will bring a tear to anyones eye. Infinity war lives up to the hype and beyond, the end of everything has never been this good.","displayName":"Daniel S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-30T16:14:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-14T14:50:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"922085619","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel S","accountLink":"/user/id/922085619"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"This first was a load of fun.
