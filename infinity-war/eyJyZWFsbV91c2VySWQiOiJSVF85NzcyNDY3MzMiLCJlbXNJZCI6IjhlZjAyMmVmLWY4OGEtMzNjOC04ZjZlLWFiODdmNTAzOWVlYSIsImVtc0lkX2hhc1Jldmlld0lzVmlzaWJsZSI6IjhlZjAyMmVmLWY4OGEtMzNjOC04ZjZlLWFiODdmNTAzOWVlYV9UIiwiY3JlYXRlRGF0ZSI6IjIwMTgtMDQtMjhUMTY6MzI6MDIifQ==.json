From the very beginning it set the tone for the entire movie- intense and no punches pulled. There really was a sense of real danger for all of the characters, creating genuine fear for the lives of all of your favorite heroes. But that is what is expected of Thanos! If Marvel had nerfed the villain like what they did with Ultron, I would've been sorely disappointed. Now all of our favorite heroes finally have a villain that is a worthy foe, and if some contracts have to end, we now know that the characters will be given a worthy exit!","displayName":"Vanessa W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T16:17:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T16:34:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246715","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vanessa W","accountLink":"/user/id/977246715"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
