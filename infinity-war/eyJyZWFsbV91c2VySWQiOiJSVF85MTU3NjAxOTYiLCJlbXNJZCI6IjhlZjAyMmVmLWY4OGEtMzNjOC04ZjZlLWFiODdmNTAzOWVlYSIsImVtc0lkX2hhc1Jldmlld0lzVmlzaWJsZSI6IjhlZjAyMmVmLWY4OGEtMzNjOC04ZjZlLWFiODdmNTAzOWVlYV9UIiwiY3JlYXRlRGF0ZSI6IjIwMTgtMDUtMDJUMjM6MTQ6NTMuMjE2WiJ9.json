Compared to some of the others it much better as a story. A nice blend between dialogue and action. Might be the best 3D movie yet. The graphics were superb. Doozy ending. 7.5 out of 10.

You just got your ass handed to you by the MCU.  This movie has to be one of the best movies I've seen since..... I honestly can't remember the last time!\nIt's much more than an action flick... or a superhero movie....It's actually great CINEMA.  Good plot, good twists, good character development, good build, good resolution, VERY unpredictable.  And yet... those unpredictable moments were neither gratuitous nor predictably unpredictable (if that makes sense).  I won't get into details, because as much as I would like to share the awesome MAGIC that is this movie, I want you to appreciate it as I did.  This is one movie where spoilers WILL ruin much of the movie's effect. \nI can tell you this much.... one example of the perfect mastery of balance in this film...  We all knew from the very first trailer that the Guardians Of The Galaxy would meet up with The Avengers.  Now, the tone of GOTG movies vs Avengers movies is highly contrasting - Guardians is borderline slapstick comedy cloaked in Marvel ethos while Avengers tends to be more dramatic action with sprinkles of humor.  How do you bring those two very different materials and blend them into a smooth and believable alloy?  In this case, very carefully, and VERY successfully!  Neither part was compromised, and the mix was impeccable. \nI will wait a few weeks before delving into the specifics that make this movie so incredible, so you have a chance to see it.  And at that point, I will also explain how the MCU did EVERYTHING right that Star Wars Episodes 7 & 8 tried to do and failed MISERABLY.  Also.... I hope The Walking Dead writers go see this movie and take COPIOUS notes!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1800666133310206/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T22:32:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T22:33:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"977254605","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977254605"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wow.

I’ve watched every avengers movie since the beginning, and this movie just trashed all of it, and now I never want to see another marvel movie ever again. I know there’s this new “artsy” thing going around in Hollywood that weirdos love, but this world sucks enough. We should feel good about ourselves after seeing superhero movies, as if we could be them and fight evil too. This movie could’ve been great, but instead has crushed countless people’s dreams of what should’ve been a great movie with an even better message to end on.
