Save your money! The 26 different plot lines never connect, the characters fail to meet any of their previous performances and the ending is so vague and unsatisfying it made me want my money back.

Thank you Marvel Studios for giving us the awesome entertainment from the past 10 years and I'm sure you'll keep entertaining us in the future.
