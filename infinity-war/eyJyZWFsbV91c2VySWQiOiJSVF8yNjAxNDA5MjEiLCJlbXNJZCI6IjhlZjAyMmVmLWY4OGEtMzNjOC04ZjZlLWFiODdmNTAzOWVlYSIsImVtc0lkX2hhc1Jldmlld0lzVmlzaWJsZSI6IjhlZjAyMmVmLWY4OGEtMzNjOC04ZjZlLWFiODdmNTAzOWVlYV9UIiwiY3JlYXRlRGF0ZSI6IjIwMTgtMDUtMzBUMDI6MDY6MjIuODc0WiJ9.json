However, I'd have to argue that your fanship lends to an overrated review. There are a few logical appeals in your review, by stating several facts that imply the movie was quality made, such as \"a reported cost of $300-$400 million USD\" and \"intense music score from Alan Silvestri.\" In the review, these facts imply the movie to be great, but instead are simply facts about the movie and nothing more. \n\nApplying the Dr. Gan's 7 Keys to the movie would show that the movie was fair at best, but severely lacking in one department: truth-filled. While I agree with the facts of Matthew Toomey make this production skillfully-made, and the teamwork displayed in the movie (even by members who didn't know they were on the same team) respected the dignity of the human person, and perhaps the attitude awareness of the movie could relate to speaking up against tyrants (???), I think that this movie was for hardcore Marvel fans to just watch their heroes on a screen for two hours. This movie lacked truth as it was merely a narrative of the Avengers and friends fighting (largely unsuccessfully) against yet another evil villain who is putting the universe in danger yet again. There was nothing didactic or even individualistic about this movie.","displayName":"Ryan B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-29T19:37:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-29T19:41:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"977297853","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan B","accountLink":"/user/id/977297853"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My expectations were exceeded.","displayName":"Greg R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1455999574/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-29T18:45:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-29T18:46:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"969331989","realm":"RT","displayName":"Greg R","accountLink":"/user/id/969331989"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Still Holds up as a Stellar Superhero Adventure Film, Childhood fantasy turns reality in the Big Screen.","displayName":"Nick S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1589148136/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-29T18:16:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-29T18:20:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"969730270","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nick S","accountLink":"/user/id/969730270"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Surprising is all I have to say.
