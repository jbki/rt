Marvel billed this film as the culmination of ten years of films, truly you'd be lost without seeing the previous installments. The Russo Brothers have a job to do so the bus keeps rolling with disregard to your relationship with the universe, I loved that personally. Action was insanely good, CGI incredible, character interactions were both hilarious and heartbreaking. I loved Infinity War. Only negative feedback is that certain story elements last a little too long while others left me longing for more.","displayName":"Wesley Y","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T05:50:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T05:55:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"977242119","realm":"RT","displayName":"Wesley Y","accountLink":"/user/id/977242119"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"3 hours of depression.
