Second the movie had a very hard to follow plot. The sons of Thanos added absolutely nothing to the overall story. Other than that I liked seeing all of my favorite marvel characters come together in an epic battle of proportions to fight against Thanos.","displayName":"Evan B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-02-16T15:56:08.000Z","updateDate":"2019-02-16T16:01:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"977773181","realm":"RT","displayName":"Evan B","accountLink":"/user/id/977773181"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"By far my favourite MCU film with the great balance of action and comedy as well as living up to the 10 years building up the encounters we've been waiting for: Doctor Strange and Tony Stark, Guardians and Avengers and obviously the showdown with the mad titan. A must see to all superhero comic book movie fans. All actors did a stellar performance!

Even though we had so many 'main' characters on screen each one was noticeable and whether, short or long, had their moment.\nThe action scenes looked good and even though the film had a depressing tone (which i admired) compared to other MCU films there was still some very feel good moments. shout out to the actors who bounced banter and dialogue of one and another to keep this film flowing. A nice twist at the end and i look forward to seeing what Endgame brings.","displayName":"Elliot C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-02-11T04:25:07.000Z","updateDate":"2019-02-11T04:28:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"977788655","realm":"RT","displayName":"Elliot C","accountLink":"/user/id/977788655"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely phenomenal movie.
