But you'd be wrong. The thing that stops everything spinning out of control is the central villain Thanos, and his desire to get all the infinity stones to carry out his genocidal scheme to save the universe from itself. That the CGI Josh Brolin is an eco- warrior makes the plot cohesive and acerbic, intelligent and conflicted. Even his ridiculous chin makes sense.\nThe Russo brothers hurl their heroes this way and that - thank God we know the story so far - if you don't, forget it, don't see this movie. No, this is for those of us who have seen the 10 years of Marvel and want to know - WTF is going on? Well, now we know. And it's the most ruthless film of its type, sacrificing heroes this way and that, sometimes for good, sometimes for the hell of it.\nAs this is clearly part one, we can tell the villain comes out on top - but in part two, he sure as hell will fail. Maybe all the fallen will be magically brought back to life? Bet on it.\nStill, the Star Wars franchise over at Disney should take a peak at Marvel. No extraneous plot lines, no pc SJW feminism, just a 2/12 hour shot of popcorn munching adrenaline called an Avenger's movie. Of course it is extreme overload, but this is what I expected - and this is what it delivered. You have never seen anything like it and will amazed how much of it worked. Mind boggling eye candy.","displayName":"Richard B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T05:30:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T05:47:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"953525032","realm":"RT","displayName":"Richard B","accountLink":"/user/id/953525032"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely fantastic.
