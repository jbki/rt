And I can definitely say that this movie accomplishes everything it presented it self as, going into it. It is fist and far most a Thanos movie . And I personally liked that compared to Thanos and  his quest everything else seemed insignificant .To the point that even I was not allowed to fully  mourn the death of my favorite characters, but somehow feel sad for Thanos ....and also understanding his point of view.All in all I personally rank this as my favorite MCU movie so far score 9.5/10","displayName":"Remi A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T07:55:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T12:58:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"977177214","realm":"RT","displayName":"Remi A","accountLink":"/user/id/977177214"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome for every Marvelfan!","displayName":"Sim V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T07:52:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-07T08:26:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977237678","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sim V","accountLink":"/user/id/977237678"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was awesome on every level a must see.

Saw it last night. \n\nAbsolutely amazing movie. CGI and Acting did not disappoint. Thanos is now officially the very best MCU villain, this movie is more of a Thanos movie TBH. No characters are safe so watch out for that. All I'll say. Only criticism is that some characters got to shine a lot more than others, seemed to me like the Russo Brothers (Directors) had a tough time trying to juggle so many different characters with so many agendas into 150 minutes of run. And that ending straight hyped me for Avengers 4.\n\n9.8/10","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2053846911311547/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T07:39:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-25T18:03:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"977237649","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977237649"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"}]}
