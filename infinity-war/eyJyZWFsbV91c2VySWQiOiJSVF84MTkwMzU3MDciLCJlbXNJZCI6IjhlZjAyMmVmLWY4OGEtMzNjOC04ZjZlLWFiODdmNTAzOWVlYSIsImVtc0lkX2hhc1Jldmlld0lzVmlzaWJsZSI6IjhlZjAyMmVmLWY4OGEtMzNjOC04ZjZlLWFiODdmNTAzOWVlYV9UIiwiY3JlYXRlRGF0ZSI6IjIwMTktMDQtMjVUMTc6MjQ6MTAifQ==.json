This is the superhero film that all superhero films should mould themselves on. I've always enjoyed marvel films but I tend to put them in that albeit a bit patronising bracket of \"It's good for what it is\", but Infinity War is just a really, really, really good film. It benefits of course from all the interweaving stories from previous films; thus creating a sheer visual, action-packed treat, with the highest of stakes. 2 and a half hours flew by and it leaves you on one of the biggest, most shocking cliffhangers in movie history. Never has the buzz been bigger than it is for Endgame and Infinity War is my absolute favourite marvel movie, until maybe later tonight...","displayName":"Oscar A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-25T08:47:38.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-25T08:56:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"977939403","realm":"RT","displayName":"Oscar A","accountLink":"/user/id/977939403"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A really good movie.","displayName":"Skylar F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-25T08:19:54.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-25T08:20:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"977416932","realm":"RT","displayName":"Skylar F","accountLink":"/user/id/977416932"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Really good hero movie!!!","displayName":"Lucas d","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-25T07:13:34.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-25T07:13:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"978003356","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lucas d","accountLink":"/user/id/978003356"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"The best of the marvel series with a well crafted villain, it does a fair job at balancing its large cast of characters but their issues lie in the lack of significant development beforehand.","displayName":"Jack S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-25T06:54:52.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-25T06:56:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"978003315","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jack S","accountLink":"/user/id/978003315"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Incredible ending to the MCU just absolutely out of this world","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2480267742040802/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-25T04:21:48.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-25T04:22:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"978003067","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/978003067"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It is absolutely mind blowing.

No plot twists, no surprises but just an objective throughout the entire movie. They even managed to make iron man uninteresting. Nothing of real substance other than the villain.
