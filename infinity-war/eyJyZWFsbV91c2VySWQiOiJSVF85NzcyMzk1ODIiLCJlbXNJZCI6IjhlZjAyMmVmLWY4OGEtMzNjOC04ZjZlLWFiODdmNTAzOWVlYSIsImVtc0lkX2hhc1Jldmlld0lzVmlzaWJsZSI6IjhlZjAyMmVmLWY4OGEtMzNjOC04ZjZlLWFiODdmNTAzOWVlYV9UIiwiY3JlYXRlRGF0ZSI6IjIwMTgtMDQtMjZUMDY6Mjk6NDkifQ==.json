This is cinematic suicide and brushes dangerously close to kiss of death. Without spoilers, the ending would be okay if I knew part 2 was right around the corner. Even Lord of the Rings knew better and had part 3 scheduled within a year. You cannot have marvel movies follow with leaving this massive string hanging. Personally, I’m a little mad at the ending and the poor, poor lack of post credit spoilers.

WOW! Plain and simple- WOW! It is your great summer action blockbuster. If you have not been watching the previous films this will confuse you. You MUST have seen previous films to be able to keep up, as it starts immediately with intense moments and rarely slows down for breathers. There will be those that dislike that, but if you are a fan of comics this is how you want it. Action with comedy thrown in to lighten the intensifying moments that this just keeps building. This movie delivers. It's worth the money.
