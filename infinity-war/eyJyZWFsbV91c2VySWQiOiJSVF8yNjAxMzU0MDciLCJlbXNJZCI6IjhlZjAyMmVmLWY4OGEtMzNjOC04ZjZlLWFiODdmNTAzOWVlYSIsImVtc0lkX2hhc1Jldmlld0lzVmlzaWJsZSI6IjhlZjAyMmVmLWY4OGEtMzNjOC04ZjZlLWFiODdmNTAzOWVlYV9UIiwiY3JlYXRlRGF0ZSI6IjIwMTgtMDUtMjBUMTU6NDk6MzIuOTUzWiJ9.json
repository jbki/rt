I am in awe at what the Russo's were able to pull off here.  All hail the kings of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  See it, you'll love the story and how all your favorite characters are handled.

It's a harsh way to transition to what is clearly going to be the next installment.  I don't think it's any secret that this is part one of two.  Thanos is a good villain.
