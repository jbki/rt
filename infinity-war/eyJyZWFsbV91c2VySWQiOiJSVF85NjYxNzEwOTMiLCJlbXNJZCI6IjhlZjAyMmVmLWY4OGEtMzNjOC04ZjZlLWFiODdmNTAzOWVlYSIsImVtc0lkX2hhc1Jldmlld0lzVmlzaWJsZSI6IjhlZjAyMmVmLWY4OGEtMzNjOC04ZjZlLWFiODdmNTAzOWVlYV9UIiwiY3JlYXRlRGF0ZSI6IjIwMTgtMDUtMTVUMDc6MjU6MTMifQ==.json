Some of the action scenes over use jump cuts which tends to make the action scenes tiresome to watch. The movie is also constantly throwing more action scenes at you instead of delving deeper in to the characters stories. I believe that Stephen Mcfeely and Christopher Markus should have spent more time on the script. In conclusion this movie was a lot of fun thanks to some clever jokes and a memorable villain in Thanos.","displayName":"Joey W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1620541438253953/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T05:36:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T05:46:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"976034372","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joey W","accountLink":"/user/id/976034372"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I was rooting for Thanos, he didn't disappoint.","displayName":"Nuno B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T05:27:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T05:28:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"928308586","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nuno B","accountLink":"/user/id/928308586"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I am so curious how they're going to come back from this â™¡","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T05:13:14.067Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T05:13:14.067Z","user":{"userId":"781048967","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/781048967"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Truly an amazing movie, deserves all of the hype and a better ROTO score.
