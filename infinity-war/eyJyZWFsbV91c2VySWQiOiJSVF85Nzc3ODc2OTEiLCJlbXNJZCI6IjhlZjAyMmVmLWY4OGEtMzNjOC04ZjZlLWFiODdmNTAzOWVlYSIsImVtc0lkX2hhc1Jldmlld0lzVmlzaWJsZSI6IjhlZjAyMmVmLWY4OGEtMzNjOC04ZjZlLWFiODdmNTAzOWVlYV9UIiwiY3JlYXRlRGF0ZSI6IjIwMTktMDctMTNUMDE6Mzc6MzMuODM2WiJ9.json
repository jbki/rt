It's paced so well even though there are so many characters and so much is happening. Every character feels present and nobody came across as sidelined. The villain is very well written and comes across as an actual character with depth despite being a maniac. The only fault I can give is that the effects were a bit lackluster at times. Overall, I highly recommend it for everyone.","displayName":"Joe H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-08T10:36:08.252Z","updateDate":"2019-07-08T10:36:08.262Z","user":{"userId":"978130058","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joe H","accountLink":"/user/id/978130058"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The time has come for the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and a few new additions to come together for the first time as they go up against the mad titan, Thanos, in this big epic action-packed, visually stunning, comedic, and emotionally satisfying crossover!","displayName":"Gabriel D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-08T02:16:45.547Z","updateDate":"2019-07-08T02:16:45.547Z","user":{"userId":"978095387","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gabriel D","accountLink":"/user/id/978095387"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Thrilling action packed movie that actually shows real risk and loss.

Stop, before you go insane over that hear me out.  Endgame is an incredible movie, but when I went to rewatch it, it was really for the battle at the end.  Time travel stuff was fun, but less engaging than Infinity War.  When I went back to rewatch this, I wanted to see it all.  Every minute is non-stop fun, whether you are crying over a death or cheering when characters interact or do something awesome.  Sad to not see Hawkeye or Ant-Man in here, but the movie is able to balance out every character and give them their deserved time before the biggest shock of all time at the end.  To top it all off, Thanos is the perfect villain and he is far better than Endgame's Thanos.  The one here is basically the protagonist if you watch it from his POV.
