Movie covers so much ground and so many characters. Everyone gets their due. Loved the Guardians portion. They add music, humor and irreverence to the originals. Lots of casualties but we still have the big four around to get revenge. Josh Brolin was tremendous as Thanos giving a nuanced performance as the bad guy with no interest in self enrichment.

I could talk about the rambling and disjointed plot; the film leaps between multiple plot lines like a rabbit on speed. I could talk about the jarring quote-unquote \"humour\". Most of all, I could talk about the dream-like, unrealistic quality of it all. Infinity War doesn't feel like a movie. It is so meandering, so meaningless, so extremely unrealistic that it feels more like a dream - or some extremely morbid fanfiction. Furthermore, Infinity War is not a movie for children. In fact, I sincerely feel sorry for every child who had to sit through that.\n\nI'll be delving into spoiler territory now, so read on at your own peril.\n\nOne scene especially in this radioactive trashfire of a movie stood out to me. That was where the Guardians, following the Asgardians' distress signal, first encounter the wreckage of the ship. They watch the countless bodies floating by in horror. A genocide, an unspeakable tragedy, has occurred here.\n\nTwo minutes later, there's a running gag about whether Peter Quill is, in fact, overweight.\n\nTo call that \"jarring\" would be an understatement. I sat in the movie theatre shocked and wordless, unable to fully comprehend the idiocy which I had just witnessed with my own two eyes.\n\nI give this one star because of the poor people who had to waste their talent making this film.\n\nGood God.","displayName":"Aidan D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T05:21:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T05:29:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"976625271","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aidan D","accountLink":"/user/id/976625271"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"FUJJING AMAZING.
