Thanos finally arrives and is a bad ass, however, CGI could’ve be better and makes him look pretty fake. The lack of the hulk in the movie was disappointing. Yea, his ass got whooped by Thanos and now is a chicken but he could’ve taken on the weaker villains.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T15:37:10.644Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T15:37:10.644Z","user":{"userId":"947016135","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/947016135"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"This movie was very long and left alot to be desired. Without spoiling the movie I will say the ending is one of the most disappointing parts of the movie, do not expect to leave saying WOW! The standard reaction I had and most was that was kind of lame. \nFrom a Christian perspective a derogive mention for Jesus by Starlord, along with a statement by Thanos refering to himself as \"I AM\" was disheartening. \nThe effects and action were the movies lone saving grace. I hope the next movie really makes up for this flop.","displayName":"David W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T15:35:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T15:47:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249288","realm":"RT","displayName":"David W","accountLink":"/user/id/977249288"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I'd say I'm let down, but this is marvel we're talking about, so expectations are below sea level. Let me outline the plot for you (spoiler free!):\n\nQuip, quip, plot thing, wannabe drama, wacky and/or zany occurrence, cgi fight epilepsy, manufactured drama because the writer knows there's supposed to be a drama beat at this point, not because it belongs, quip, quip, superheroes doing superhero shit, quip, wacky thing, bigger cgi clusterfuck, drama, fake tension.\n\nI hope I saved someone some time with this. \n\nJust know that every time you go and pay to see one of these big superhero movies, and now tragically Star Wars as well, you're paying disney and telling them that their best course of action is to keep making the same shit over and over as they have been doing. I beg anyone who will listen to vote with their dollar and pay for a real dramatic, thrilling, frightening, and/or emotional cinematic experience rather than these \"movies\" that come out like an assembly line. We're better than this, people.

Unfortunately, it felt like watching an extended clip-show recap for a series of past shows that I should remember before watching the next season, which I assume is Affinity Wars II despite Marvel  and the directors insisting they ditched the two part movie back in 2016.","displayName":"Gage H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/177400112/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T15:34:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T15:45:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"808245992","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gage H","accountLink":"/user/id/808245992"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Avengers; Infinity War not only brings a refreshing take to the franchise, but makes for a fun and engaging movie.","displayName":"Anthony M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100004073281463/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T15:34:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T18:14:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"938519157","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anthony M","accountLink":"/user/id/938519157"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie has everything you would want. A perfect villian, beautiful character team ups, and it certifies that marvel still has it. The way that Thanos goes after the stones is close to perfection. One of the stones he uses makes it first appearance look like garbage, and when its used, its a scary and fun expierence. If you've been living under a rock you would know that the characters are split into three main groups. They switch between each group after a while and it makes you want more of the group you've just been watching. Now, there's been an issue with quips in the past. But here, it just adds to the character connection and it doesn't feel forced, nor rushed. The jokes here make you laugh. Not just a quick chuckle, but full on laugh. It makes me hope that the Russo Bros do the same with this in Avengers 4. Now, we all know there were gonna be character deaths. I wont spoil then for you, but when Thanos kills them, some of the characters feel a tad rushed. They do this because it makes you think about what else Thanos can do. It makes you scared. Horrified. To see what will happen next. Everything about this movie makes the long time fans scream like a mad man. But I took my friend who only saw Ragnarok and Homecoming and they understood the plot well, and they wish that they watched the rest of the MCU. Infinity War is a masterpiece and it asks the question- Can Avengers 4 live up to the hype it created? Well, I think it will.","displayName":"ethan o","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T15:32:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T15:47:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249280","realm":"RT","displayName":"ethan o","accountLink":"/user/id/977249280"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable movie that didn't seem that long.
