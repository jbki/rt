Thanos is BY FAR the best Marvel super villain to date(and maybe character).  His logic, emotional ups and downs, and power are unparalleled in the Marvel movie universe.  He is a breath of fresh reality and I'm glad he won :-)  Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy crew also kept me entertained through this three hour movie. \nI totally loved the movie up until Marvel interjected/forced Wakanda land into the mix.  All that yelling, screaming, and chest pounding by the Wakadans is super annoying.\nI also would have liked to see Galactus, but maybe next movie...","displayName":"Darth P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T23:05:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T10:24:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"977002003","realm":"RT","displayName":"Darth P","accountLink":"/user/id/977002003"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The MCU just moved up another gear and is accelerating away as one of the movie franchises of the decade, this could have been a mess but instead tells its story with amazing clarity and the villain of the piece strides through the movie like a Titan ;)","displayName":"Dean F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T22:59:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T23:06:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"909550576","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dean F","accountLink":"/user/id/909550576"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"}]}
