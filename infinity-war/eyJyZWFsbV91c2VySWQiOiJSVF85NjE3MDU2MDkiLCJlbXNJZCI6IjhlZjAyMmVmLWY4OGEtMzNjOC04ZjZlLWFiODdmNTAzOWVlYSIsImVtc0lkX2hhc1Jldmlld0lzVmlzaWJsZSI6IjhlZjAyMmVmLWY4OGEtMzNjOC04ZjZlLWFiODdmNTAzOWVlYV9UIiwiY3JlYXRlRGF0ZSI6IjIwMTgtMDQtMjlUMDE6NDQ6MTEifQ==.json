This movie had so many heartfelt, genuine moments, but was also full of fantastic humour, drama, and interaction. The twists are incredible, I never could have expected Black Panther and Spider-Man to die, of all characters. Some might say this makes the film too dark, although, many complaints with the marvel universe have always been about lack of consequences and strong villains. While Hela, Loki, Vulture, Ego, Killmonger, and Ronan were all great villains, but Josh Brolinâ€™s Performance as Thanos was damn near perfect, almost painting him as the protagonist. My only complaint with the movie was with the fast pacing, but I would expect this, with so much to jam into one movie. Overall a complete cinematic masterpiece. Hats off to you, Russo Brothers!!!

Cant wait until Captain Marvel and Antman&the Wasp. \nFeel emotionally wrecked by Disney! Good job! \nIf you are planning on going and haven't seen any of the movies that lead up to it, please do yourself a favor and see at least the main Avengers movies ( Assemble and Ultron) and Captain America Civil war. \nSo far everyone I know loves this movie, even my hairdresser who had only seen Guardians and Dr Strange. \nMust see movie of the decade.","displayName":"Esther C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1481853942143112/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T01:22:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T01:26:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"971826067","realm":"RT","displayName":"Esther C","accountLink":"/user/id/971826067"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"}]}
