Infinity War Part 1 does a mash-up for the MCU that usually only happens in Marvel Comics. I was caught up in the good guys and the bad guy.

My personal favourite being when black panther has a huge fight.\n\nI like the fact that Thanos needs 6 stones, instead of just needing 1 big powerful stone that's hard to find. \n\nThe cons\n\nThe ending was a bit cheap and obviously a setup to the next movie, also a great tip when watching this movie, stay for the end credits, it's crucial. Also, I felt like it wasn't all the Avengers, it felt like they were all seperate. It was like iron man and his little gang were the main characters, and the Captain Americas gang was just there for a fight at the end of the movie.\n\nSpoiler Alert!!!!\n\n\n\n\nThe deaths in this were shocking. The saddest would 100% be Spider-Man, no doubt. So when other people died it felt like it happened South those deaths didn't matter. \n\nLast thing, Thanos got the stones way to easy. He just came to earth and got like 2 straight away.\n\nOtherwise great movie and I recommend it to any super hero loving guy or girl.\n\n-Chris Boloutis\nAustralia","displayName":"Evan B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T20:24:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T20:24:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"951999239","realm":"RT","displayName":"Evan B","accountLink":"/user/id/951999239"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Maravilhoso, maravilhoso e pronto.","displayName":"Júlio A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T20:24:00.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-30T04:08:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"816201969","realm":"RT","displayName":"Júlio A","accountLink":"/user/id/816201969"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The writers fell in a plot hole so big they couldn't get out.
