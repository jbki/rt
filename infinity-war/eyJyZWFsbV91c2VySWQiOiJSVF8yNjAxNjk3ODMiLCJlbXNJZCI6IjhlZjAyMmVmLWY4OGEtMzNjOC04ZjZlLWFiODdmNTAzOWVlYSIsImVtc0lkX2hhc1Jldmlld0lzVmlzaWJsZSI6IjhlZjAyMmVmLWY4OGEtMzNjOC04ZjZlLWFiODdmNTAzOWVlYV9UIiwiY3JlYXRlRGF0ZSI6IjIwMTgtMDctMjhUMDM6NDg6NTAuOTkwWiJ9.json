It  relies on shock factor to make the audience think it's much better than it really is.

Initially the idea of having this many super hero’s in a film can be a very bad idea, but marvel managed to do an amazing job at balancing all the superhero’s time on screen. It’s got great jokes that don’t feel forced, and this movie has got a lot of great things going for it.

I'm not the hugest fan of Marvel movies (I never saw Thor 2, Black Panther or Dr Strange and I didn't really like Iron Man 2&3, Age of Ultron or the first Thor), but I like most of the characters and do love a few of the movies and enjoy the rest. This one is definitely in the top tier of Marvel movies for me.\n\nThere was a lot of great character moments, and I feel like the comedy worked perfectly, definitely not too heavy handed ala Last Jedi or Age of Ultron.\n\nThe action was nice and fun to look at, but was a positive and a negative. While the action scenes looked nice there was a few too many and they dragged on a bit too long, but when they worked they worked.\n\nThanos was definitely the best Marvel villain yet and felt like a real threat. Josh Brolin played him perfectly and there was a sense of melancholy to the character that I loved. This is the rare Marvel movie that felt like it actually had stakes because Thanos felt like such a real threat.\n\nIt is definitely the darkest Marvel movie yet, and I loved that. Lots of dead bodies and lots of murder even right from the beginning. There was some pretty emotional scenes that tugged at the heart strings a bit.\n\nI don't want to spoil the ending, been trying to keep this spoiler free, but I do want to say that I loved the ending. Definitely the best ending to any Marvel movie to date, and I absolutely loved the last shot.\n\n??? 1/2 Very Good / Interesting Concept and Execution / Evoking","displayName":"Dexter B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-26T23:56:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-26T23:56:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"977382196","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dexter B","accountLink":"/user/id/977382196"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A Good Movie overall, worth rewatching","displayName":"Brian C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-26T18:15:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-26T18:16:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"977381747","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian C","accountLink":"/user/id/977381747"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing and can't for part 2","displayName":"SuperVideo%20 G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-26T17:32:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-26T17:33:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"977381410","realm":"RT","displayName":"SuperVideo%20 G","accountLink":"/user/id/977381410"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 26, 2018"}]}
