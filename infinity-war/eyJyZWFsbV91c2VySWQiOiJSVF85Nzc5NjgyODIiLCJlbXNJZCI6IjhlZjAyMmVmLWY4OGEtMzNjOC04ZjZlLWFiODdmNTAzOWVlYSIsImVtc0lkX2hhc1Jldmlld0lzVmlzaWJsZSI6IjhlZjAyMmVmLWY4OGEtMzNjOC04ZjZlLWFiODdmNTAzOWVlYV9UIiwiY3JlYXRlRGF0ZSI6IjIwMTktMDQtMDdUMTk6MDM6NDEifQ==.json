This is actually a Supervillain movie. All those event should never happen if they can keep 2 important individual away from Thanos. The script is terible. And the cream on the top is the stupid last act by Thor. All that is good come from the cgi fight but the story makes no sense.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2527597187282042/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-07T11:49:54.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-07T11:53:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"977785045","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977785045"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"5 Thumbs up!

But to juggle three plotlines with a host of characters and make it work is tough, and it doesn't work fully as a unit on its own. And while Josh Brolin does an admirable job, his character wasn't set up enough for this audience-member to be fully invested.","displayName":"Cameron A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-07T04:28:55.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-07T04:31:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"968518058","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cameron A","accountLink":"/user/id/968518058"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Is a review really necessary?
