Is this a marvel film? yes. to clarify, its almost like marvel has created its own category of quality. thiere is bad, good and marvel. To elaborate, this movie has the same feel, style, colour as pretty much every other movie. It has a faster pace, but they needed this to squeeze in all the characters. the reality is that the plot is established previously, simple in nature and so we move on to the spectacle. my issues are more with some of the choices made for character. A bested Thor, and easily defeated Hulk- the two most poerful avengers, taken out in the first 10 minutes. Thor spends the whole movie undoing everything from Tho3 where he learnt he didnt require a weapon, in fashioning a brand new weapon. hulk, is now scared.. all so we could spend more time with iron man, iron man who does magic and iron spider.  asides from these points, I found the action to be overwhelming yet no impactful at all. the tracking shots that whedon produced.. there was nothing like this. its just a lot of bright lights. This for all intents and purposes, is a CGI movie. the issue is that the CGI, just looks like CGI. for all the praise people give Thanos' look- you neve think this is an actual person. you always aware its just a purple hulk. They would have done better by using a mix of cgi, prosthetics and real like stand ins. Im sure im in the minority, but I wont automatically love a movie because it is marvel. finally, the shaky cam.. the cheapest most awful thing to happen to cinema since 3D. overused and awful by the Russos- as it was in winter solider and civil war. this could have been the greatest action movie ever. instead its a 'marvel' movie.","displayName":"average j","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-26T13:18:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-26T13:28:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"977336020","realm":"RT","displayName":"average j","accountLink":"/user/id/977336020"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Full climax for the 10-year old MCU.
