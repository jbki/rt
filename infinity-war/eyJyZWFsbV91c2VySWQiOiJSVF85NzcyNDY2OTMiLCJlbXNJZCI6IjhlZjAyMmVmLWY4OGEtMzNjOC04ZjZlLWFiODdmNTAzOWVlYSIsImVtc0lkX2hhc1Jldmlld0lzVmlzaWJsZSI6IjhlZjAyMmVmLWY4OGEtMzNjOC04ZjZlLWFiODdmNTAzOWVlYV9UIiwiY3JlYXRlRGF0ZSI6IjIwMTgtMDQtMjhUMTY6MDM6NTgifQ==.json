I'm honestly very disappointed. I know the comics, but I still am trying to parce out the movie. The motives of Thanos were too monolithic and simplistic. Very James Bond villain type of thinking. Very one dimensional and making very little sense.","displayName":"Arsenio E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/33614002/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T16:02:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T16:04:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"793875784","realm":"RT","displayName":"Arsenio E","accountLink":"/user/id/793875784"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Action packed. Good comedy. Good length. There are missing characters who could have made a big difference in how the movie turned out. This is what I expected would happen in the movie. I would have liked to have been surprised thats why only 4 stars. And Marvel needs more blood and guts. Also, when people die they need to stay dead.

Each line, every scene, like a gear, takes its place in this mechanism. Stupid characters make critical mistakes, smart characters play long-playing plans, all atypical decisions of the characters have justifications that are imperceptible at first glance, and all the plot holes are filled with an existing MCU plot base. Unlike all previous Avengers movies, watching this movie doesn't make sense without knowing the previous franchise films, but this is its uniqueness.\nWhat work has been done in these 10 years and how harmoniously it is connected in its pre-climax is worthy of respect.","displayName":"Daniel S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T15:56:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T15:57:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246677","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel S","accountLink":"/user/id/977246677"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The movie was good until the end where they killed off HALF of the superhero's which made a toddler in the theater cry.
