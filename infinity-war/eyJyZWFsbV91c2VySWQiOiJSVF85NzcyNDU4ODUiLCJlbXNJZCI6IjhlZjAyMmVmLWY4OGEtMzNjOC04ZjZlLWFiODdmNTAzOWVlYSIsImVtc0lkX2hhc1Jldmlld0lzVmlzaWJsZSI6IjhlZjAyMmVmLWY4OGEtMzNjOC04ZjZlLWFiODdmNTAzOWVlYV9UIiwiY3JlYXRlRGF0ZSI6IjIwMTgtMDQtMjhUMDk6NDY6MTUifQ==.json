I adore Marvel but this was so underwhelming for me. This was essentially a two hour punch up with very little actual story line. After seeing the movie, I can understand how half of the cast managed to shoot without readin the script - with the exception of Thanos and the Guardians (and perhaps Tony) the remaining cast had, at best, 8-9 lines each. \nThe last time we saw Cap, he was still Cap - this time we see him, star ripped from his chest but not once a mention of the name Nomad. Infact we dont really know anything about where he has been or what hes been doing. The last time we saw Wanda and Vision they were eating paprikash - now theyre in bed. Gatorade and Peter were last talking about their 'unspoken thing' - now they're making out and in love. All interesting little elements that we completely skip over.\nThe Black Order were under powered and underwhelming. With the exception of Maw, the other members were weak, forgettable and not particularly well introduced. I don't remember actually hearing Proxima Midnights name in the whole movie.\nFinally, the ending was just so...depressing. It was also hugely unconvincing. Nothing here is at risk, as we know that the 'newer' cast members have upcoming movies and remaining movie contracts therefore confirming that they haven't really died. For me, this took any real sort of emotional sting out of the tail and just left me feeling flat.","displayName":"Hannah F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T09:42:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T09:50:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245872","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hannah F","accountLink":"/user/id/977245872"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Arguably one of the most darkest movies in the MCU.

The story is... okay at it's beat, but way too predictable and contains quite a lot of plotholes that people just seem to ignore... \nThe villain is also very overrated, even though his doings at first seems understandeable, they're not. If you were to eliminate half the population of the universe, you have to think about the after math. So many people would be depressed and kill themself. And many leaders would die, and this would lead to wars over resources. After all this film does really disapoint, but since my hopes weren't that high for the film, it still gets 2/5 stars.","displayName":"Sammy F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T09:38:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-02T12:10:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"976409917","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sammy F","accountLink":"/user/id/976409917"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"All I can say is OMFG.

It leaves Marvel fans feeling like the last 10 years of world building and character development really meant something in the story. If treats the fans like fans,  having assumed that you know these characters and do not need another origin story for every hero.  And most importantly it avoids what the Last Jedi did and allows you to get lost in the Marvel MCU without drowning you in personalized agenda and social justice messages that might otherwise rob the film of character and story. Thank you Marvel for caring about and respecting your fans rather than trying to lecture and shame us . Long live Marvel, king of the Box Office.","displayName":"Alex G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T09:35:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-19T05:20:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245861","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex G","accountLink":"/user/id/977245861"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
