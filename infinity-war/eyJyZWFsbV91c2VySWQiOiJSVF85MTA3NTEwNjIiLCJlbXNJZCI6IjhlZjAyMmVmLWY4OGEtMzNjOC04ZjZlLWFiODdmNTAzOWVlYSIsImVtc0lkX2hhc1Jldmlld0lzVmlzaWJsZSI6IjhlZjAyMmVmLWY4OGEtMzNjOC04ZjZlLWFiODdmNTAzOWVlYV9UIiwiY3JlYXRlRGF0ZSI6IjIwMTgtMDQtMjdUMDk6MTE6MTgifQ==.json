Each superhero gets his or her chance to shine, and Thanos holds his own as the antagonist. This movie can't really stand on its own, but is has an epic feel, as well as enough humor & action to keep fans of this cinematic universe entertained.","displayName":"Joel H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10203681510265464/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T09:10:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T09:11:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"838850011","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joel H","accountLink":"/user/id/838850011"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was beyond epic.

Its self allusions, comedic relief, and moments of intensity make the movie watchable, enjoyable, and fun.  But the stakes have risen - these heroes' lives are at stake, and yet, the payoff for this film leaves you empty- the word I have been seeing around the web is \"hollow\"- which is very accurate.\n\nI should be very sad/upset/depressed/angry/distraught/etc right now because (insert hero(es) name here) died.  I should be wondering how the Avengers are going to regroup and continue with (name) gone.  But we aren't going to be doing that.\n\nInstead, we have to wait another year with a little less coin in our pocket.  This movie raised the stakes and did not deliver (even with its ending, we all know...)  It is good.  See it.  But wait unti May 2, 2019 if you can... if you catch my drift.","displayName":"Warren Bubba C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/39800757/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T09:05:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T09:53:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"792715975","realm":"RT","displayName":"Warren Bubba C","accountLink":"/user/id/792715975"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Cliffhanger of the year, after 10 years of waiting.
