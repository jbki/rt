But it pays off exceptionally well for those fans who have followed the MCU from its infancy. The characters have been fully developed so there's not a lot of that to be done here outside of a few, which is essential to help move the plot of this story forward, but it's a plot heavy film, so it works. That said, Thanos does get exceptional development. This is as much his film as anyone else's, and really addresses Marvel's previous Villain issue.\nIt does have to ignore some characters for extended periods due to the breadth, and while that does make it tougher to stay invested all at once, it is necessary given the vehicle.","displayName":"Craig F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/905832628318/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T10:12:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T10:20:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"972446091","realm":"RT","displayName":"Craig F","accountLink":"/user/id/972446091"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"La mejor película del año ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T10:11:14.439Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T10:11:14.439Z","user":{"userId":"906740536","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/906740536"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This film was COMPLETELY awesome = 10/10, A+ the best action/comedy/drama combo in a superhero film yet!
