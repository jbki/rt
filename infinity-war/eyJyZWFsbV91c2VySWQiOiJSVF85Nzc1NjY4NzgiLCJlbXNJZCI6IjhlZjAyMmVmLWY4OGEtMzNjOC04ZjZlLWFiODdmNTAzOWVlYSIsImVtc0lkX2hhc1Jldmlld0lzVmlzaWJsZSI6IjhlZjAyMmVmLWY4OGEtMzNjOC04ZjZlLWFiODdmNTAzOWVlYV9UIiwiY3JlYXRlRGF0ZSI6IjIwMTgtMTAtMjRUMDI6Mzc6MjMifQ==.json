This movie was honestly great as I reflect on it. The heroes fight bravely against Thanoes as they try to stop him from destroying the world. However, I felt that at some parts it was boring, because it was constant fighting, which is natural for a movie about war.  Aside from that, the movie had captured the war great and left many people, including me, in tears. Lastly, this movie left a lot of suspense that only feeds the Marvel Fandom.","displayName":"Sarai C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-23T18:36:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-23T18:47:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"977566271","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sarai C","accountLink":"/user/id/977566271"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 23, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love this movie, thats it.","displayName":"Irak%20 R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-23T10:54:02.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-23T10:55:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"977565550","realm":"RT","displayName":"Irak%20 R","accountLink":"/user/id/977565550"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 23, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Definitely the best MCU movie and one of this year's best","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-22T22:30:44.877Z","updateDate":"2018-10-22T22:30:44.877Z","user":{"userId":"260203173","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260203173"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 22, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it.

Fans everywhere enjoyed this flick, including people who were new to the \"Marvel Cinematic Universe\". Then the ending came, we lost so much including Black Panther, Star Lord, Groot, Bucky, Mantis, Drax, Loki, Gamora, Heimdall, Vision, Wanda Maximoff, Doctor Strange and Spider Man.
