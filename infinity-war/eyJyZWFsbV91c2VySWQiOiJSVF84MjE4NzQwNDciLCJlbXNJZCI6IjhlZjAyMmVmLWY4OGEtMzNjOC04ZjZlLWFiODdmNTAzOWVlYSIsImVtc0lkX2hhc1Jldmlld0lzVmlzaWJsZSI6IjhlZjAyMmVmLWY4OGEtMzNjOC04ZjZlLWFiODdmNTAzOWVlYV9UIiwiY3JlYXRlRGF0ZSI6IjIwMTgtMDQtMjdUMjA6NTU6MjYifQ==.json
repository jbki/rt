Surely that would save you!\" Fortuna... Unfortunately, that did not save them and we were treated with an amazing cinematic experience where the plot and action scenes were highly engaging and entertaining, character motivations and turmoil was understandable and in other cases relatable, and a villain that you love to hate as well as hate to love. My only negatives of the film was that several of the heroes make decisions that were disastrously stupid, but given the most disastrous decision was an emotional outburst was made by an idiot, I'd give the majority of the film a pass. This movie was fantastic, my second favorite superhero film of all time, after Logan.","displayName":"James D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T20:51:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T20:51:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"915634712","realm":"RT","displayName":"James D","accountLink":"/user/id/915634712"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best marvel movie yet","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/464007470686439/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T20:51:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T20:52:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"977244409","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977244409"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"this is one of the epic and best avenger movie thanks to the ruso brother who directed this and the all the heros were so maintainly put together and their sences. i saw ragnarok and thoughts it amazing and the black panther came out out and it was in my top one after seeing infinity war it was more thrilling emotional comedy entertaining and it in my number 1 movie of the marvel second being black panther","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/387602885058712/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T20:50:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T20:55:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"977244407","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977244407"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My new All time favorite movie ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T20:49:58.553Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T04:05:19.713Z","user":{"userId":"967885107","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/967885107"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best time I've ever had at the theaters.
