While there are some flaws, this is an emotional, surprisingly funny, and action packed entry that has rocked the MCU.\nPROS:\n-Thanos is the best MCU villain, right along with Killmonger. Josh Brolin was the perfect casting choice.\n-Action scenes are well shot and are ones Marvel fans have been waiting for years.\n-Brilliant performances all across the board, particularly Brolin, Saldana, Hemsworth, and Holland.\n-There are actually consequences to mistakes being made, something that the MCU needed more of.\nCONS:\n-A lot of the scenes seem more like fan service instead of trying to progress the story, especially scenes introducing the characters\n-A whole bunch of heroes packed into this film, and sometimes it was a little overwhelming. Some heroes are unfairly not shown enough, to make room for the \"important\" heros.\n-The Black Order, or the children of Thanos, are kinda just a footnote in the film, and that can be disappointing considering their role in the comics.\n- Some characters act/make decisions that seem unlike them, and that can be attributed to the Russo Brothers working with characters developed by many different directors.\nThis was a satisfying and emotional entry into the MCU that succeeded in filling the hype. Some of the major flaws are keeping me from saying that this is the best MCU film, but it is definitely the most important film so far, and I am excited to see where they go from here.","displayName":"Nathan C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100006553500590/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-27T21:33:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-27T21:46:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"956053804","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nathan C","accountLink":"/user/id/956053804"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Most depressing movie ever, I'm sorry I've seen it and won't recommend it to anyone.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10215899615980760/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-27T11:32:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-27T11:34:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"977443213","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977443213"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"For me, it is a contradictory movie, between 2 and 3 stars. The point (spoilers) is that is an impressive end, but 1) it plays too much with the hope of spectator in a bad trick, 2) most of the time, you feel this is happening because Avengers don't know what they are doing or act without thinking, something that happens in most of their movies (someone has already seen that most of the troubles Avengers solved, are ones they get in previously). At the end, you think something terrible has happened, but not because it was inevitable, but because Avengers act as children (Starlord), they do not have good ideas even about what they do most, that is, smashing (Thor) or take irresponsible decisions (Dr. Strange; even \"Endgame\" was not able enough to explain why the best solution was not to destroy Time Gem in first place, and avoid Iron Man, Jarvis and 5-years deaths in the first place). With all this in mind, I appreciate the maturity of a bad end, the crossover and the cruelty of some scenes (Thanos and Gamora, for example), but you think that they have walked in a garden with so many trees to go out neatly. At the end, you do not think Avengers will save the world, but you wouldn't trust your grannie in their hands according to their rate of success.","displayName":"Millo T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-27T10:02:23.000Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T15:59:04.730Z","user":{"userId":"802126699","realm":"RT","displayName":"Millo T","accountLink":"/user/id/802126699"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A AWSOME MOVIE after waiting for ten years this is what we get good movie thanks marvel studips for bringing us a desevering movie for those ten years and a very speical thanks to the Russo Brothers for bringing us the avengers trilogy","displayName":"Emmanuel L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-27T04:35:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-27T04:38:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"977442683","realm":"RT","displayName":"Emmanuel L","accountLink":"/user/id/977442683"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Great effects and all, but in the end nothing more than a boring collage of all things MCU.
