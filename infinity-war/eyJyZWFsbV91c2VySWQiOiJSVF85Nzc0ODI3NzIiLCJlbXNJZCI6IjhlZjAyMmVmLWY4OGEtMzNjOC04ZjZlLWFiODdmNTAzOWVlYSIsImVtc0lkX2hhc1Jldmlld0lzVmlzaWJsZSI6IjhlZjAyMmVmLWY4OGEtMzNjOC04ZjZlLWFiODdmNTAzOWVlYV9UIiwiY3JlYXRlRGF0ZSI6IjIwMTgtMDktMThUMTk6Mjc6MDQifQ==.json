There's nothing such as a perfect movie, but it is probably close to the best movie it could have been.\n\nMy favorite Marvel's character has always been Captain America, but in this movie I have to give a big round of applause to the mighty Thor. Unmoored early in Infinity War, Thor no longer simply faces the question of his place as a hero but his place as a god. Thor has been torn apart and left as a broken thing who must now struggle to redefine and forge a new family to replace the one he lost. When Thor himself holds open the iris of Eitri's forge, it's the birth of a true hero, forged in pain and sacrifice, delivering one hell of a satisfying blow with a brand new ax of justice. Thor's teary-eyed confession to Rocket, in which he discusses all of things he's lost, is one of Infinity War's best scenes and affords the character a sincerity that Hemsworth has rarely had the chance to play.\n\nOverall, great scope, action, team-ups, twists and style/direction the franchise is being taken delivering upon the hype needed for such a massive event of a film, needed to be seen on the big screen. And I can't wait to see mysteries unfolded in the upcoming Avengers 4.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1027482577431759/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-17T05:06:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-17T05:07:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977402253","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977402253"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A great cinematic feast.
