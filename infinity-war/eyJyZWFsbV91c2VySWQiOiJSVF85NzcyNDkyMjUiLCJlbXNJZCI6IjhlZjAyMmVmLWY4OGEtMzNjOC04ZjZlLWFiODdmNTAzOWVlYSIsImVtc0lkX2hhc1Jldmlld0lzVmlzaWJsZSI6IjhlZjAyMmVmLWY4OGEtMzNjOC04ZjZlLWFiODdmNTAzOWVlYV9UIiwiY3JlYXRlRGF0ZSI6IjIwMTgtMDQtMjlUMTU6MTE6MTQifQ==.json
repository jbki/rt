The different heroes and worlds come together beautifully, the character chemistry works most of the time, and it manages to be comedic, without feeling light hearted, cheesy, or taking away from the brooding  atmosphere. Unlike any past MCU movies, this film was unafraid to take risks, and throw the unexpected at you, which truly made it great.","displayName":"Alex C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T15:02:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T07:40:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249208","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex C","accountLink":"/user/id/977249208"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"This movie was decent, and I would definitely go see it again. But the entire thing felt like one giant Third Act, with flimsy character development and little to no story. The plot drove the entire movie, which I personally don't like. The cinematography and sound were unremarkable, but that was to be expected; this is a Marvel movie.\nThat being said, I did like the special effects of the movie. They were pretty good. The character interactions were enjoyable as well, but did little to enhance character development. The story was lacking, if it was even there in the first place.\nThe end of the movie felt like Plot Point 2 or an \"All is Lost / Dark Night of the Soul\" moment rather than the ending. I was let down by the ending as a whole.\nI really only felt genuine emotions for about five characters, which surprised me considering how many characters this movie threw together. There were a lot of in-between moments that could have been added to create a story, but those were either cut or never written in the first place. \nTL;DR: This movie was decent, but not the blockbuster hit I was expecting to see as the culmination of 10 years of moviemaking. Great action sequences but little substance. Subpar character development, but enjoyable interactions. Amazing score (shoutout to Alan Silvestri). I would give this movie a 7/10 if we had a 10 star scale, but RT only has 5.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1098225856976015/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T15:01:15.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T15:07:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"976637553","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976637553"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"An amazing culmination of 10 years of build up.
