This is an action packed thriller with a massive cast of all Marvel's beloved heroes. The most screen time is allotted to Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Thor, Vision, and Scarlet Witch. It is a large endeavor that turns out to be highly enjoyable.\n\nThe Russo Brothers direct Infinity War with surprising care to character development and intimate moments. We get entertaining interactions between the leads and supporting characters that are sure to please. The stakes are raised to intense heights with major deaths and actual consequences. The combat is is cool precisely choreographed. Commendations are in order for The Russo Bros. for adapting the most iconic moment in comic book history with The Snap. Thanos is intimidating and works well as a villain. Infinity War is a well made movie.\n\nThe acting performances are particularly endearing from Robert Downey Jr., Benedict Cumberbatch, Chadwick Boseman, Chris Hemsworth, Paul Bettany, and Elizabeth Olsen. I really like Chris Evans as Captain America and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, but they are not given a lot to do relative to the aforementioned stars. The main star is of course Josh Brolin as Thanos. Brolin's massive stature and dramatic delivery bring the mad titan to life with terrifying realness. He adds an emotional depth to a character that could have easily been overdone. Thanos is monstrous. The cast is well executed for such an enormous ensemble. You get moments with every character, but there are certainly standouts. \n\nAlan Silvestri's score is beautiful and memorable. The inspiring theme for The Avengers and the horrifying accompaniment to Thanos is epic. Silvestri delivers his greatest composing yet. You will leave the theaters, but Infinity War's score will remain with you.\n\nOverall, Infinity War is entertaining and a well made movie, not just by Marvel's standards. The acting is a few notches above the standard fare for Marvel's films. I think most audiences will enjoy all Infinity War has to offer.","displayName":"Matthew D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-07T12:56:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-14T18:51:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"976559665","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew D","accountLink":"/user/id/976559665"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie, Great!
