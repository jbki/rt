You have done it again! This is without a doubt one of my favorite Marvel movies. This proves also that rotten tomatoes scores don’t mean crap, it’s the popcorn score. This also proves without a doubt that Star Wars failed not because of Disney because of certain producers of Lucas arts did not care about the Character development or storyline. Reason affinity wars works so well is because all the characters were so developed you cared for every single one. As for the story they kept extremely close to comic. It was amazing action packed but beautifully well executed. DC you can learn from Marvel as can many others. Great job Disney and Marvel.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T15:25:08.505Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T15:25:08.505Z","user":{"userId":"260048883","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260048883"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Incredibly violent and concentrated on death and dying and fighting for 90% of the movie. I would never recommend this to children or in fact to anyone who doesn't love to watch death and dying. Limited plot basically one villain looking for stones and that is the extent of the plot. Not up to the previous aveger movie and this is a very huge waste of time period","displayName":"Melissa C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T15:24:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T15:26:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249259","realm":"RT","displayName":"Melissa C","accountLink":"/user/id/977249259"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"To say it's a game changer would be an understatement. Perfectly crafted, perfectly directed, perfect interactions (Thor and the Guardians were just made for each other) and the perfect Thanos that made me sh*t my pants.\nHave you ever had that emotion which has a ton of this and loads of that with little amounts of this and a pinch of that and overall it's something you can't describe? Exhilaration, perfect and pure joy, heartbreaking sadness and anger with an overarching excitement that's more than you've ever felt before. That's what I felt in more than a word.\nIt's more than a Marvel movie and it can't be rated or compared against the rest of them. It's an experience. A more than perfect film. After 10 wonderful years of MCU greatness what you see in Infinity War will change you.","displayName":"Manavis H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T15:22:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-13T16:07:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249253","realm":"RT","displayName":"Manavis H","accountLink":"/user/id/977249253"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Beast fucken movie ever","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/470937223339404/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T15:21:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T15:22:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249250","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977249250"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"I'm a fan of the MCU, but I don't really see myself rewatching Infinity War. Sure, this movie has a great villain, but the movie is 10% story and 90% action sequences. And that story that is there just isn't very interesting. The story is, Thanos is collecting the Infinity Stones and punches his way through everyone to do it. The ending is a real downer that has however no significance because you already know they announced the next Spiderman and the next Guardians of the Galaxy. Besides, this movie features way too many characters and the movie's pacing is really weird. it's hard to focus on anything because they show you 15 minutes how Thor makes his new weapon, then you see another 15 minutes how Cap lands in Wakanda, then 15 minutes of Thanos and by the time you come back to Iron Man and Spiderman again, you feel like they have not been in this movie for ages. It's not a terrible movie, unfortunately not a very good one either.","displayName":"Nine A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100003533834484/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T15:21:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T15:29:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"963799418","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nine A","accountLink":"/user/id/963799418"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Movie was everything I wanted to see. go see it....now!

Infinity's quips are quippy, every hero gets a moment, Thanos is pretty awesome, and the directors deftly cut between plot lines. But while the  planetscapes and space effects look good, can we just admit that all CGI fights are the same and most are tedious? And though the fanboys gasped, we all know at least 3/4 of the spoilers will be undone...","displayName":"David C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/500011183/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T15:19:14.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T15:19:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"783976514","realm":"RT","displayName":"David C","accountLink":"/user/id/783976514"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I was shocked, surprised, hurt, laughing, cheering and finally crying all through out this movie.
