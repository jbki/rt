It keeps you on your toes, there's action around every corner. Plus everybody loves when they collide movies and shows. So of course, everyone wants to see all the heroes get together. Also this one isn't focused on the avengers winning all the fights they makes this one realistic. When I say that I mean they heroes can't win every time right?  \n\nLike I said everybody loves seeing all the heroes work together in one epic movie, Im sure you've seen the other avengers and marvel movies. So you should know Thor, his brother loki and their enemy Thanos who they are trying to stop in this movie.  We have all the big legues like iron man, hulk , captain America, spider man, even the black panther made an entrance in this film. We got our comedian characters like groot, rocket, drax, peter (star lord) gamora and lets not forget nebula. Then we have Dr. Strange he is one of the holder of the infinity stone The whole point of this movie is them working together to try to stop the almighty thanos.  \n\nRight from the jump they throw you in the mix where thanos hijacks thors ship and tried to take one of the stones he need to be the most powerful villain. That's when Dr.strange knew thanos was coming to earth. Even thanos children are powerful they had iron man and all the avengers trying to fight them off. It isnt even all action there's cute scenes like when gamora and star lord start forming a romantic relationship. That's not the only memorable scene for gamora, she was the one to shank thanos thinking she finished it even though it was hard for her because thanos was the one to look after her. There are just so many curve balls that they throw at you. One epic part was when thors hammer broke and groot made a handle for him and he did some major damage and it saved his life.  \n\nOf course, in every movie there will be things you don't necessarily like. In this one there wasn't much because it's a great movie but after all they did to fight him off they still didn't succeed I mean I get they have to lose some time but come on, everyone was in. That's the thing I like though how great they work together. It shows you sometimes you must make sacrifices for the greater good. They aren't people just trying to save the world they turned into a family , Its just a great mix.  \n\nNow this is why I loved the movie because its not just action there's other themes all mixed In.  I hope after reading this you watch the movie. I left out so many great scenes you should really find out how it ends.

I truly never thought that this movie would be able to juggle as many characters as it did.  I was wrong.  'Infinity War' manages its characters, while simultaneously providing extensive development for Thanos, who I was convinced was going to end up being a generic villian with dull motivations.  Thanos is brilliant, and Brolin's voice and demeanor was a perfect choice for the character.  The performances are solid throughout, and most characters capitalize on their opportunities to make an impact on the audience.\n\nThis film is emotionally poignant, exciting, and truly unique.  Marvel is beginning to get into a rhythm that is bolstered by the fact that they know what the audience wants to see, and operates accordingly.  My biggest complaint is that the film left me wanting so much more, which I see as more of a positive than anything else.","displayName":"Clay D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-03T12:39:43.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-03T12:39:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"977944349","realm":"RT","displayName":"Clay D","accountLink":"/user/id/977944349"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie that lives up to all expectations and really gives you the buzz of what could happen in the endgame movie which comes out April 2019!
