It is certainly NOT a movie for children, yet parents seem quite happy to take their under 13s to it based on my experience. The violence is over the top. It teaches youngsters the bad people win. Watching semi-realistic CG violence on a big screen is vastly different to reading a comic books with bubbles of Ratatat, boom, biff and so on. Horrible movie.","displayName":"Terry B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-18T02:21:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-03T17:35:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"951926115","realm":"RT","displayName":"Terry B","accountLink":"/user/id/951926115"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Loved it, non-stop action from beginning to end.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-18T01:38:47.266Z","updateDate":"2018-06-18T01:38:47.266Z","user":{"userId":"260105901","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260105901"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A movie that exceeds all expectations!!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/874548919396325/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-18T01:10:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-18T01:11:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"977324437","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977324437"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome!

This movie shows us something that was never thought possible when it came to a cohesive long-running cinematic universe. This does very much feel like the culmination of every Marvel movie to date and delivers (for the most part). Thanos is a strong villain and every actor involved gives some of their best performances in the series. This would've only been rated higher if I wasn't left feeling like something was amiss. Some characters remained underused. Hopefully Avengers 4 helps fix those feelings left over from this.","displayName":"Fionnlagh O","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000224760643/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-17T22:25:15.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-17T22:27:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"884653654","realm":"RT","displayName":"Fionnlagh O","accountLink":"/user/id/884653654"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 17, 2018"}]}
