Everything works and works amazingly well - the characters are spot on and it's really an improvement on the first two Avengers movies (which served their purpose).  \n\nWith 10 years of Marvel movies and the rumors and speculation leading up to Infinity War you just wanted something BIG.  While Infinity War is big... it just never really goes all out and doesn't get as BIG as it needs to be. Despite a decade of build-up and hype, Thanos isn't much more than a paper villian - and while that worked well with the previous Avengers movies, this one needed a bit more.  His motivation here isn't much more than a cardboard Bond baddie.\n\nThe first films had amazing chemistry and character development that helped overcome it's thin plot and lack of a foil that had any depth. Infinity War has more heroes than ever, so the strength that helped the first two is spread a little thin.  But, even so - if you know the characters, they don't miss a beat and they all work well. With the exception of Captain America (or Steve Rogers)... who didn't seem to have enough to work with and I wanted more from.\n\nIt's still a spectacle of movie. Amazingly well made with a plot that holds water and characters that still shine. If you want a big pay off and a real culmination of a decade of Marvel... wait until next year.","displayName":"John D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/594490288/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T14:02:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T14:15:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"878547547","realm":"RT","displayName":"John D","accountLink":"/user/id/878547547"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fastest two and a half hours of my life.

Okay, BP was a good movie, but Homecoming was utter cinematic excrement, *especially* compared to Infinity War.\n\nLook.  This movie made me care about characters that I utterly LOATHE and the villain is the single best superhero villain, ever, period.  It ties in so many little bits and pieces and the overview makes *sense*.  \n\nIf Rotten Tomatoes weren't full of complete garbage, this movie would be the highest rated of all the Marvel movies.  Period.  I've NEVER sat in a superhero movie where every single audience member watched in utter, rapt attention for the entire movie.  Even when it ended, everyone just sat silently, utterly shocked and blown away.  Even though all of us obviously knew there was going to be a post-credits scene, usually people are fidgeting, checking their phones and so on.  Not this time.  I even heard people crying.\n\nNo, this isn't some candy-coated little tee-hee POS like Homecoming, so it might be over the average early tween's heads.  (And yeah, the Spidey fans are all going to be butthurt, I'm sure, but  if they were at all fair, they'd give Holland credit with portraying what a REAL teen would do and feel in that situation, which is more than I can say for Homecoming.)  The villain is complex and beautifully acted and motivated (and I tell you, I NEVER thought Josh Brolin had that level of acting chops), the deaths made sense and in some cases, were incredibly and heart-breakingly redemptive, and the laughs came where they needed to.  Most of all, there was a sense of ties being mended and deeper bonds pulling together the unlikeliest of people.\n\nIt was fantastic.  Go see it.   Ignore anyone who says it's not great, because it is.  I know I just got fed up permanently with Salon for their moronic review of this and canceled my subscription.","displayName":"Nocturnal R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/454099621611699/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T13:57:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T02:14:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"976421887","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nocturnal R","accountLink":"/user/id/976421887"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best marvel movie ever!
