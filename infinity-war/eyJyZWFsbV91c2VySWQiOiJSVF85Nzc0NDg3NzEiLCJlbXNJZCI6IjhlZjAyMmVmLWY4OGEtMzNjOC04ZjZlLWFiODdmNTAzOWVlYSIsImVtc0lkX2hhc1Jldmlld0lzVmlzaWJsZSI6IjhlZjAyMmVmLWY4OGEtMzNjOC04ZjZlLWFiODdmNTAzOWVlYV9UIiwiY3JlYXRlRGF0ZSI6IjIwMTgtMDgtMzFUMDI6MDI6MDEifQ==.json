The conflict and the structure of the story was very well done, while there were 3 different stories going on, they were all unique and balanced out very well creating a story arc in each of the three, making a fun fest of all our favorite superheroes in the past 10 years.","displayName":"Jeremy N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-30T01:44:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-30T01:59:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"977447293","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeremy N","accountLink":"/user/id/977447293"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great sequel to the Avengers saga!

But I went to the cinema to watch it with my friend and after not understand what was going on at all, I then took it upon myself to watch the entire MCU films. A few heartbreaks and some tears later, I finally understood the MCU and had to wait for Infinity War to be released on iTunes so I could buy it and put myself through even more heartbreak as I knew about the unpleasant ending. After watching it again, I was in awe. I cried at the end due to the end of Spiderman before he had even started. But the film is amazing and it has made me even more excited for Captain Marvel and Avengers 4. I think that it has been the best Marvel film by miles, due to how everything links up within the previous films and I believe that's something Marvel does so well and they cannot be beaten. They're the best. Overall, I'd give Avengers: Infinity War a rating of 9.5/10 (only because they killed Bucky Barnes and I'm not happy about that. Also, Peter Quill deserved his happy ending with Gamora) but it is now my all time favourite film.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2098711353726429/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-29T08:57:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-29T09:05:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"977446248","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977446248"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The biggest story told after the greatest cinematic crescendo in film history.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-29T04:37:38.373Z","updateDate":"2018-08-29T04:37:38.373Z","user":{"userId":"954615959","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/954615959"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"that was awesome. there was my favorite character in marvel starlord. although because of him, they missed out very important things.. i cheer him!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2174688946149810/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-29T01:53:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-29T01:56:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"977445807","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977445807"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 29, 2018"}]}
