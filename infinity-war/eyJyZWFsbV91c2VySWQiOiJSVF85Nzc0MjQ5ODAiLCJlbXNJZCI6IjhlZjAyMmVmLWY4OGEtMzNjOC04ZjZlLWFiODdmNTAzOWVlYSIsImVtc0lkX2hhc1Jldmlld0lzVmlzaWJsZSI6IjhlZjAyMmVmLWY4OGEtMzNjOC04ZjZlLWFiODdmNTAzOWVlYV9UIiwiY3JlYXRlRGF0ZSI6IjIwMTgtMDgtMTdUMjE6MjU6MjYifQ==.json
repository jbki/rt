Don't say I didn't warn you\n\nI LOVED Avengers: Infinity War. It's one of the best MCU movies, it's got a more darker tone like The Empire Strikes Back, but it's also got the classic Marvel heart and wit. There's also great writing, acting, action, and every character is so well-developed and gets their own important role. It also surprisingly has an emotional ending in which most characters disappear, which will leave audiences wanting to watch the next chapter.","displayName":"Roy R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-17T14:15:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-17T14:27:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"974708908","realm":"RT","displayName":"Roy R","accountLink":"/user/id/974708908"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 17, 2018"}]}
