No matter which MCU character you show up to enjoy, you will be leaving work feelings... Strange feelings after the performance and role of everyone on screen. At moments the humanity of my very own existence is captured boldly on the big screen and I was moved to near tears. This hasn't happened to me from a movie since....I don't remember when! From Thor's brief moment of expressing loss andOkoye's one line declaration of being prepared to fight till the end to developing an unexpected fatherly bond with the Mad Titan, this was a rollercoaster ride of epic proportions.","displayName":"mo s","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T11:11:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T11:22:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"952374621","realm":"RT","displayName":"mo s","accountLink":"/user/id/952374621"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"By far the best comic book film EVER created!

I don't think the writer of this article realized that the entire movie is from Thano's point of view.
