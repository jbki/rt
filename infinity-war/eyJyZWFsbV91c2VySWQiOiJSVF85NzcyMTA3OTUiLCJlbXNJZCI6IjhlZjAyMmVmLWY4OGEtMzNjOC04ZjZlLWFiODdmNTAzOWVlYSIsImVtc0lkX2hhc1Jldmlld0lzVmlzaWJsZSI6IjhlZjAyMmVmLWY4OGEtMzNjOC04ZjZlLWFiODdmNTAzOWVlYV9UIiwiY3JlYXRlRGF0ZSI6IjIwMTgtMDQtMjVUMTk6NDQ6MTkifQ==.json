The CGI is a tad off for a Marvel film, but it is better than Justice League, BvS, and Black Panther. The story is very interesting and leaves a bad taste in the mouth of Marvel fans on purpose. They start to show the end to some of the beloved characters on the big screen, doing what many fans hoped would never happen. The movie is a joy to watch, but grab a tissue because it is a tear-jerker for many fans of the franchise, including myself.","displayName":"Gavin A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T19:19:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-28T21:12:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"977090766","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gavin A","accountLink":"/user/id/977090766"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"5 stars it was amazing","displayName":"Melissa P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T19:10:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T22:30:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"977238783","realm":"RT","displayName":"Melissa P","accountLink":"/user/id/977238783"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The action scenes were amazing.
