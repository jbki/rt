From the start the film takes you on a emotional rollercoaster and the tone of the film is set. Each of the parts where the characters come together in the own little gangs was equally amazing. The comedy, action script was all spot on. Over the years you have grown to love these characters so when something happens you feel it. No complaints on acting side, Josh Brolin stole the whole film as his performance as Thanos, in a strange way you felt empathy for him and felt his sadness. By the end I just sat there a emotional wreak waiting for the next part.

While you certainly get your money’s worth at 2.5 hrs, there is also too much of a good thing. Thanos is an impressive display of how well a computer generated character can ‘act.’ But please Disney, STOP with the jokes/character competition. It’s Disney more then Whedon since he wasn’t directing or writing on this one. EVERY 5 minutes there’s a joke, or sarcastic snip, or 2 characters arguing over who’s the smartest/best looking/better fighter/etc. LET A SERIOUS MOMENT BE A SERIOUS MOMENT. It’s funny once or twice, but damn is it too much here. Also, not a fan of the trend in movies/tv to make villains more sympathetic. Evil people are truly evil. Evil intentions are truly evil. Even Hitler had a girlfriend, but that does not mean we should see him as flawed.
