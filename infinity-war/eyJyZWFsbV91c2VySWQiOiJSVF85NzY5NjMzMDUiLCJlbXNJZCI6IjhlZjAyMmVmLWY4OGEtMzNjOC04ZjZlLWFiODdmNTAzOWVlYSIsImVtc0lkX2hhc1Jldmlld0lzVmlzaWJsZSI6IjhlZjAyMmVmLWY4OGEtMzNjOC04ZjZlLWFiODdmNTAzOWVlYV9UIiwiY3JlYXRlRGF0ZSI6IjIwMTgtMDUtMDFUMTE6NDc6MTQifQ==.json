A remarkable feat. While it settles for actions and spectacle over more somber character-driven moments, what is there (Thanos is a remarkable villian) is enough to compel you go forward, and to await the conclusion next summer.","displayName":"Andreas M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1305250386/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T11:38:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T11:48:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"868213295","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andreas M","accountLink":"/user/id/868213295"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It was great just like everyone is saying it is","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T11:35:11.010Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T11:35:11.010Z","user":{"userId":"836993424","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/836993424"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Three days removed from seeing this film and I am still amazed. The difficulty of balancing all of the characters in one movie was accomplished, seemingly with ease, to create an exciting, emotional, compelling, beautiful superhero movie, with a brilliant musical score, amazing special effects, wonderful story, great performances, unexpected moments, heavy hitting scenes, and tremendous action sequences. Is there anything else you could want in a superhero movie? I was glued to the screen from start to finish and I cannot wait to see what comes next.","displayName":"Ken J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T11:24:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T08:25:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977252635","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ken J","accountLink":"/user/id/977252635"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome, mind blowing, lives up to the hype!
