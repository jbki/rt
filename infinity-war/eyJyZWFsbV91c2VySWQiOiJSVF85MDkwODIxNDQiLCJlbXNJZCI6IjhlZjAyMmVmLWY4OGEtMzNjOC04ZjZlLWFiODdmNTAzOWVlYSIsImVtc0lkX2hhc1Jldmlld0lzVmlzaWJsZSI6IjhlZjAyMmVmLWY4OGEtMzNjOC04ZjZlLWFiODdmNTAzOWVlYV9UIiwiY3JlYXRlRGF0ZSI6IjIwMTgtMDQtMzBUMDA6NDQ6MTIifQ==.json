Very interesting to see where the writers for the film adaptations of the marvel universe have taken the overly complex Thanos Comic Arc and storyline. It is  masterful writing For cinema. The marvel world is massive with tons of heroes/action and alternate universes. So, seeing it handled in this fashion is really original and interesting. All of the actors really hold this movie together, lots of memorable emotional interactions and unforgettable screenplay. this movie set a new standard and reshaped what it means to make a SuperHero movie. I doubt anything will even scrape the surface of this new highly set standard....","displayName":"James G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T00:37:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T00:52:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"918068658","realm":"RT","displayName":"James G","accountLink":"/user/id/918068658"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Being a big fan of the Marvel films, i had high expectations of the latest movie, and it did not fail. The movie had it all, comedy, action, emotions and all of our favourite characters get equal screen time. There were times where it lacked the shock factor and felt predictable, but all in all a fantastic film and a must see for any superhero film fan.","displayName":"Grant W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10154442617528988/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T00:35:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T00:38:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"975220971","realm":"RT","displayName":"Grant W","accountLink":"/user/id/975220971"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent, keeps you on the edge of your seat.

It made me laugh out loud, cry, cheer, and be constantly anxious about the state of my favourite characters. Thanos is definitely the biggest and baddest villain and I am so glad he's not just your typical bad guy. He has layers and an understandable motive. If you think this is just another regular comic book movie, boy are you in for a shock. Go see it! In theatres! Trust me! It's absolutely worth it.","displayName":"Nussy R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T00:23:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T02:48:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250165","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nussy R","accountLink":"/user/id/977250165"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I loved the action.
