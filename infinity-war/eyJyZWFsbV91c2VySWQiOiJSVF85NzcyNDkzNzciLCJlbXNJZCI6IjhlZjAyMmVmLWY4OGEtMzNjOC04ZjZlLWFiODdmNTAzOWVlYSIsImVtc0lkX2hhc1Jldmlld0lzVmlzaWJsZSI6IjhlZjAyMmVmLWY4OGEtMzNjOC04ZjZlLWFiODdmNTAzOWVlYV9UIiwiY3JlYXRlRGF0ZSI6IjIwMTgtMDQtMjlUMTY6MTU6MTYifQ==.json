The only real issues I had with the film were based on pacing. its a huge movie that had to be condensed into 2 and a half hours, leaving little room for a break or filling in stuff that ends up happening off screen. The first 5 minutes of the film felt like you literally missed out on 30 minutes of the movie. I think part 2 will be a 5 star movie and if an extended cut blu ray comes out for infinity wars I will say its worth 5 stars.

A whole bunch of firsts with this one.... #1) the super villain actually is given a motive that challenges the audience to look at the situation from his point of view, and rarely have I seen superhero movies that encourage empathy for the bad guy's perspective, even if you disagree with it. #2) The other record breaking first thing I've ever seen done in a superhero movie I can't say without a spoiler's alert, so I won't, but they definitely did it. #3) I have a lot of optimism that there will be a WHOLE lot more Marvel movies in the future... and they will only get better. They did an incredible job packing this one full of action and insane surprises, and after Wauconda's record-breaking success, I have no doubt they plan on stopping anytime in the near future.","displayName":"Lauren S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T16:13:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T16:24:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"938482345","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lauren S","accountLink":"/user/id/938482345"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Fantastic Movie.

Non-stop action, emotional rollercoaster, this movie does not let up. We’ve been watching these characters and sharing their journeys for 10 years now and it still leaves us thirsty for more. Two small qualms: I don’t believe that Gamora was used to anywhere near the potential that she has, and there was not enough Cap. With that said, Thanos was brilliant. He had depth and was one of the most effective villains in a long, long time. The best Marvel movie so far IMO and I for one cannot wait for the next instalment.

Thanos is possibly the most menacing, threatening on screen presence i've ever seen in an action movie. Full of great twists and surprises that don't shoot the franchise in the leg. Not every character necessarily gets a moment to shine, but the ones who do really stand out and steal the show. All the action sequences are cleverly done and fully utilize the powers at play. The only short coming i can address is the lack of attention some large characters get, but given the expansive size of the cast, this was unavoidable. Definitely a two parter, can't wait for the next one.","displayName":"Preston R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T16:00:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T16:05:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"910680800","realm":"RT","displayName":"Preston R","accountLink":"/user/id/910680800"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Really good story and villain","displayName":"Sean Y","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T16:00:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T16:00:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249346","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sean Y","accountLink":"/user/id/977249346"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"As a huge superhero fan, infinity war is everything I needed it to be, it's a spectacle that has to be seen for yourself and a treat for fans of the genre.
