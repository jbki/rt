Yes you're invested in the characters so you connect but the writing and the plot are very shoddy. Like every scene with Vision is draining and basically pointless. Dr. Strange is awesome and Iron Man and Spider-Man are awesome. That's about it. Hulk is a cowardly baby!  Even Thor's whole situation makes no sense, but I always like Thor on the screen. Star-Lord is dumb and Groot literally does NOTHING the entire movie. The women kick ass but only Scarlet Witch has any actual powers and she's wimpy throughout the whole thing. This movie could use some Wonder Woman or even Hela gumption for real. Like everybody in the movie was scared and beaten before the fight even started. There was no like \" we are going to find a way!\" feeling in this movie AT ALL. Still it had some great parts and maybe when Avengers 4 comes out and it can be watched together it will pull this movie together.","displayName":"Leah V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/639232947/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T06:08:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T06:19:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"806137881","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leah V","accountLink":"/user/id/806137881"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Phenomenal.
