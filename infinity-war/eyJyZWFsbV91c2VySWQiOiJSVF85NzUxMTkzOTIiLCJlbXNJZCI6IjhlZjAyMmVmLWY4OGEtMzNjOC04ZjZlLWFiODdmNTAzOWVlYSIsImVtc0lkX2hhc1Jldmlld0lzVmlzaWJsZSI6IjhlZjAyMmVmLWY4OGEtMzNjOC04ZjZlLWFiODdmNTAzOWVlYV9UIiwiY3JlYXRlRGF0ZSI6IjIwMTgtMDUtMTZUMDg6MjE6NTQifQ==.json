This movie was so trash they used so much CGI it's insane, I don't know about you but I want my superhero movies to be realistic, they shouldn't be fantastical, they should be realistic, they should have people going to there day jobs in there cubicles and nothing interesting happens, now that sounds like a good superhero movie. In conclusion, this movie was trash, don't see it, go see Rampage starring the Rock if you want a real cinema experience","displayName":"Jacob K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-16T08:19:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T08:23:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"976904545","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jacob K","accountLink":"/user/id/976904545"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A decade after the first Iron Man kickstarted the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this latest instalment impressively juggles a hefty number of characters, locations, film styles and plot lines, and somehow manages to avoid being the mess that it so easily could have been (cough...JusticeLeague). Neater and tonally more serious, it still capably mines the potential of Avengers meeting the Guardians to maximum comedic effect. After watching audience and critics alike dismissing the disastrous Steppenwolf (not to mention X-Men's Apocalypse, so let's not), directors Anthony & Joe Russo (putting their juggling skills from their time on Arrested Development to good use) and writers Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely collectively take the gutsy decision to make Thanos the centre of the film, relegating the superheroes into supporting roles circling his dramatic orbit. With a script that allows space to flesh out his character and motivations properly, Josh Brolin's compelling performance and a massively improved visual rendering, the film finds its coherency. This is well paced popcorn entertainment that for the most part works. Bearing in mind this is only half the story, some of the seemingly problematic plotting can be explained away later, but with the theme of noble (self-)sacrifice running throughout, this is never going to be an easy film to end, yet in a bold and confident move, it finds an unexpectedly poignant but downbeat moment to do just that while making the film feels complete and not truncated. Even though what its audience is left with will predictably be undone (or not) next year, that suspense remains effective, and generates even more interests and scrutiny for the next 2 Marvel films coming up between this and the next Avengers film, proving that ultimately to be a dramatically and commercially astute move for the Studio and its franchises. Well played, Marvel.","displayName":"Alan W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/576243720/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-16T08:11:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-17T03:19:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"795081994","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alan W","accountLink":"/user/id/795081994"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Avengers: Infinity War not only succeeds at bringing together an incredible amount of characters, but at being an engrossing, entertaining, well-produced piece of cinema.
