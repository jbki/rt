With stunning action, amazing characters and an fantastic cinematography, its clear to see that Marvel Studios show no signs of slowing down anytime soon. All the characters are amazing, but none more so than Josh Brolin as the Mad Titan Thanos, the villain of the movie and he was well worth the wait. Thanos steals the movie in so many ways. The emotion he makes you feel isn't like your stereo typical, 'I want to rule the universe' villain, Thanos was impressive from the first moment you see him on screen until the very end. And Brolin was magnificent making the Mad Titan the best MCU villain ever. He truly is the unstoppable monster that he's been built up to since the Avengers in 2012. \n\nThe comedy was fantastic as well. And it was all properly placed. When the film needed to be serious, it was, and when it needed to be dark, it was, and it was done marvelously. The Russo Brothers proved before they could find a balance between so many characters with The Guardians of the Galaxy joining The Avengers in this latest film, but it never felt overwhelming. Yes, there will be characters you will want to see more of, but that's what Avengers 4 is for. XD\n\nMy final verdict is that Avengers Infinity Was is a 5 star must see film. Its a move ten years in the making, and with how well its done, its obvious to see why.","displayName":"David C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/211570245892163/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T14:19:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T14:34:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"974192706","realm":"RT","displayName":"David C","accountLink":"/user/id/974192706"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Shock value does not equate to good writing.","displayName":"Zack P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/742563558/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T14:19:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T14:19:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"807943815","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zack P","accountLink":"/user/id/807943815"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This movie is great, especially considering how much build up and work Marvel has put in over the past 10 years to get here. It balances its large cast incredibly well given the sheer number of characters and ground it has to cover. It subverts your expectations in a pleasant way, and you realize that even the trailers have intentional misdirection to hide details from you before you go in. \n\nOf course this movie is not perfect, a few too many jokes at inappropriate times, and some characters don't get as much time to shine as one may hope for. Given how the story is dealing with infinity stones, it's getting to the territory of time travel movies where thinking about certain plot points can ruin the magic. \n\nThis movie is probably the darkest of all the Marvel movies, and it is a nice change of pace from the other films we've seen over the past 10 years.\n\nWhile this movie spends no time developing the heroes (that's what the previous films were for), it does spend time developing Thanos into a villain that is interesting to watch and actually intimidating.\n\nWould highly recommend watching this movie, although if you are new to the Marvel universe a lot of things won't make sense.","displayName":"Marcos P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T14:08:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T14:20:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"976939807","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marcos P","accountLink":"/user/id/976939807"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I have seen the movie and It was awesome","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2110641202285239/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T14:08:09.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T14:12:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249106","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977249106"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was amazing it deserves more then 5 stars.

Mostly fun with some bold choices thrown in (Although I know the producers are going to pussy out and backtrack on those in the next one, as they always do)  The villain is actually somewhat interesting for once, which is shocking for Marvel.
