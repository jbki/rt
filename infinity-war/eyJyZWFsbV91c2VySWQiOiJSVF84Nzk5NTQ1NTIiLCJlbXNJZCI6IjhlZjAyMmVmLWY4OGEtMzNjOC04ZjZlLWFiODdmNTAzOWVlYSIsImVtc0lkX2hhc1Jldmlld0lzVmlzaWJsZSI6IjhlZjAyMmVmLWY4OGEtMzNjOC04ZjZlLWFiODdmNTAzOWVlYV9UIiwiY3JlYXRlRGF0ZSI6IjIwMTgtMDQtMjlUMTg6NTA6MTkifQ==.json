It was a great movie, up until the end. Unless they are planning to make those characters not actually dead, or that they just disappeared, this movie is crap. The rest of the movie was phenomenal, I was drawn into every minute detail, and was able to see my favorite movie characters meet. It was astounding, but the ending sucked.","displayName":"Collin H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T18:35:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T18:39:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249615","realm":"RT","displayName":"Collin H","accountLink":"/user/id/977249615"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"More than just a popcorn movie.
