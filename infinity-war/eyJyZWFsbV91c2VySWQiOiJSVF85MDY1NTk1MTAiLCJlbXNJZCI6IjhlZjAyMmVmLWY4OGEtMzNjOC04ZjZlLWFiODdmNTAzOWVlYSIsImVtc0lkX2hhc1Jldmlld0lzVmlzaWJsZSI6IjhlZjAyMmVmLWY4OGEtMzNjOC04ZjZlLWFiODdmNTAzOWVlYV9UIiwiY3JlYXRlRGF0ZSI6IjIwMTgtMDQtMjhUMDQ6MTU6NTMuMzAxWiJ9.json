Not since the Dark Knight have we seen a villain with such a good progression of character, and menace.  You can almost see where Thanos had an idea that was good but let loose with his Madness in the most spectacular and overwhelming manner.  \n\nI highly recommend this movie as an experience to see in the theater.","displayName":"Justin A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T03:51:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T04:16:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"910666048","realm":"RT","displayName":"Justin A","accountLink":"/user/id/910666048"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"awesome..but didn't like the ending","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2081415908552721/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T03:49:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T03:50:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245214","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977245214"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
