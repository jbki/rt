It's apparent there are some real cretin's out there 'professionally' reviewing movies. We should let Thanos at them. Marvel did the near impossible merging the MCU story lines into one easy to follow entertainment bonanza! Action, humor, surprises!   No matter who your favorite Marvel hero is (Starlord and Cap, then Tony), you won't be disappointed immearsing yourself in this 2 1/2 hour adventure... everyone gets relevant screen time.

Seeing Tony, Peter Quill, and Dr. Strange snapping wisecracks at one another was bound to make me squeal like a little girl, and it didn't disappoint.\n\nAt first I started finding little faults trying to find a reason to dislike the film, but I just couldn't. The initial interaction between Thor and the Guardians saw to that.\n\nIt was stellar, and even that word doesn't do it justice. Every character had moments, characters I thought would make the most difference didn't, and most of those I expected to matter very little, mattered the most. Even Groot had one of the best moments in the movie. \n\nThanos had depth, his henchman had personality, his motives were sadistic and also messianic all at the same time. Some so called critics called the ending cheap, I called it brilliant, because it gave so much depth and meaning to those that had fallen before. Those that fell before the end should stay that way, but one in particular they are going to have a problem with. The character is to important to the group.\n\nHad I not had to work the next morning I would have got back in line, even though it stretched from the Imax door back to the theater lobby. \n\nTo sum it up, how much do you want for that arm?","displayName":"Larry L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T11:16:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T11:29:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"907952768","realm":"RT","displayName":"Larry L","accountLink":"/user/id/907952768"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
