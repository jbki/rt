The gritty depressing themes were in direct conflict to the slapstick comedy of the guardians of the Galaxy, which ended seeig characters who were once serious and bruting turn into the marvel equivalent of teen Titans go. The excessive star power saw many scores get meet minutes of screentime . My only hope is for them to redeem the series with a better conclusion and to stop making movies all together","displayName":"Nick A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-27T15:14:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-27T15:17:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"977293327","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nick A","accountLink":"/user/id/977293327"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The Avengers movies take everything that is wrong with superhero movies and amplify them while minimizing the best parts of these movies.  What Marvel has gotten right is character and story.  These aren't just big, noisy special effects showcases.  They have interesting, memorable characters and the story evolves out of those characters.  But when you feel the need to cram every Marvel character ever printed to film into one movie there is a necessary sacrifice to be made.  There is only so much screen time to go around.  The result is an overproduced cocktail party at which old friends pop their heads in just long enough to be seen and say hello.  Gone are emotional character arcs and we are left with 2 and a half hours of CGI beings shooting balls of light at each other and pushing each other through buildings.  I've seen this before.  I've seen it a LOT of times now.  And you know what?  I'm just not impressed with it any more.  There are no real stakes in this movie.  Does anybody really believe that Thanos's dastardly deeds will not be undone?  Avengers Infinity War is BORING.   Unforgivably boring.","displayName":"Jim G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-27T14:54:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-27T15:04:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"977222904","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jim G","accountLink":"/user/id/977222904"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"May 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I am a huge fan of the Avengers series but this one did not do it for me","displayName":"Ryan G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1039665797/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-27T14:17:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-27T14:17:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"965014518","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan G","accountLink":"/user/id/965014518"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Worth the wait..all I need to say","displayName":"Christian G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000052898428/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-27T14:13:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-27T14:16:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"876694174","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christian G","accountLink":"/user/id/876694174"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Fun movie!
