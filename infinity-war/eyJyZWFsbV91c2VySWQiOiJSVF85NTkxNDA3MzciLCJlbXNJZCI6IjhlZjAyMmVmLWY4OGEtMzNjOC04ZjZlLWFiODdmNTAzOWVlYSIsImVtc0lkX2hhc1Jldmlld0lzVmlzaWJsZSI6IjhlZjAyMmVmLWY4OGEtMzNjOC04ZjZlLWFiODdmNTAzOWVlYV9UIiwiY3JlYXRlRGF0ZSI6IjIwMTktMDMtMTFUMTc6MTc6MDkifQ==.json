When I first heard how many characters would be in this film I was skeptical if it would be any good but that wasn't an issue. If I could change anything it would have been to slow down the pace and split up the content into 2 seperate movies because the lore and the setup and conflict escalation comes at you like a firehose.

It is one of the few films with âWarâ? in the title that actually lives up to the name. You feel how high the stakes are and find yourself in the edge of your seat. It takes everything to an 11 in all ways. When the film is over, you feel like you just went through an experience like no other. It is hard to explain, but this is the definition of an event. If you are one of the poor unfortunate souls who has yet to see this film, fix that before Avengers Endgame comes out.","displayName":"Brandon R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-10T23:55:18.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-10T23:59:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"977909872","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brandon R","accountLink":"/user/id/977909872"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fantastic.
