Even after having not watched all the solo movies it didn't really ruin it for me. If anything it made me want to see some of the movies I beforehand had no interest in. Though my passion for this series is notably missing when people starts to drop and I don't really care all that much. If you are a massive fan you obviously will enjoy this though. I understand pefectly fine the success of the movie.","displayName":"Cathy B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-13T04:52:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-13T04:54:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"977266851","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cathy B","accountLink":"/user/id/977266851"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best movie ever see","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-13T04:43:29.771Z","updateDate":"2018-05-13T04:43:29.771Z","user":{"userId":"260131485","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260131485"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Why was the last Jedi so bad & and this movie so good!!
