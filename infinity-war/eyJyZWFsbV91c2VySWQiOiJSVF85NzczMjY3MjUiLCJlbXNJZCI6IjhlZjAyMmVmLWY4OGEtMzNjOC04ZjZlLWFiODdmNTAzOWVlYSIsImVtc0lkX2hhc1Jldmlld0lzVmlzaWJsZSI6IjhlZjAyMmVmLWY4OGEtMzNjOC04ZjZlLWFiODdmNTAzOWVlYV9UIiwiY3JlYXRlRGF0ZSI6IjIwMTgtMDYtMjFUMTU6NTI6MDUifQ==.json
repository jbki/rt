Everything has impact, even if certain casualties may not be permanent. And that is because Marvel has given us characters so incredibly hard not to care about that we don't care if dead is only DEAD for a limited timespan. We don't want to lose our heroes even for a week.","displayName":"Travis H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/544371496/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-20T23:18:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-20T23:30:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"789803054","realm":"RT","displayName":"Travis H","accountLink":"/user/id/789803054"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"This movie was not bad or great it's just like watching fireworks on the 4th it's the same kind of fun kind of lame","displayName":"Mitchel H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/208702180/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-20T20:50:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-20T20:50:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"783659041","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mitchel H","accountLink":"/user/id/783659041"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 20, 2018"}]}
