The movie will leave you very satisfied (albeit sad). The only problem is that while characters like Thanos, Iron Man, and Thor are given screen time and meaningful lines, the amount of heroes in the movie doesn't make enough space for screen time for important characters. For example, Cap and all his buddies from Civil War are basically only there to kill aliens in Wakanda, and we don't even see Cap confronting Tony. All in all though, its a good movie.","displayName":"Tamaz G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T17:09:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T17:13:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249463","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tamaz G","accountLink":"/user/id/977249463"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was absolutely insane, and it truly is the most ambitious crossover ever.\nThe movie had the right amount of humour that was actually well-timed, but when they had to be serious, they were serious, unlike other movies (cough cough, the Last Jedi).\nThe only main issue that I had with infinity war was, like Thor Ragnarok, it takes too long for things to happen, but it was a little less infuriating than the transitions we witnessed in the Last Jedi. Infinity war also felt more action-packed than Thor : Ragnarok.\nAnother thing that could have been improved on is the interactions between the Guardians and the Avengers. We had some good moments, but overall, it could have been better. There also weren't as many characters in the movie as there could have been.","displayName":"Billy D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T17:09:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T11:22:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"977142978","realm":"RT","displayName":"Billy D","accountLink":"/user/id/977142978"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Worth the wait...BRAVO!","displayName":"Anonymous User","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T17:09:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T17:10:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"976871768","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anonymous User","accountLink":"/user/id/976871768"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was awesome, even though the bad guy won.

Thanos has been given a lot of depth in this movie and you understand his motive much better than even the comic book universe. The movie does a good job of showing that superheroes aren't infallible and the vulnerability is immediately apparent with that jaw-dropping opening scene. By the time the credits role, you are left shocked in your seat, unable to digest what has just happened and how it will be \"rectified\" in the future installment of this series.","displayName":"Siddhant D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/724993272/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T17:06:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T17:10:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"858287271","realm":"RT","displayName":"Siddhant D","accountLink":"/user/id/858287271"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best marvel movie!!!!
