Entertaining? Yes. A masterpiece? Not at all.","displayName":"Alex A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T17:40:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-22T19:45:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"904373144","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex A","accountLink":"/user/id/904373144"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie can almost make you dizzy with all the action.

Best I've seen in years. Action starts right at the beginning and doesn't let up. Character pairings  were incredible action sequences out of this world Story was good if not a little rushed in parts but the ending more than makes up for whatever tiny failings in this movie, Is my favorite but stand out for me in this movie were Thor Doctor Strange and Scarlett Witch. Lot of memorable action scenes, quotable lines and humor throughout can't wait to see this movie again","displayName":"Matthew C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T16:45:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T17:02:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"977028677","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew C","accountLink":"/user/id/977028677"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"So many characters, but still flowed well.
