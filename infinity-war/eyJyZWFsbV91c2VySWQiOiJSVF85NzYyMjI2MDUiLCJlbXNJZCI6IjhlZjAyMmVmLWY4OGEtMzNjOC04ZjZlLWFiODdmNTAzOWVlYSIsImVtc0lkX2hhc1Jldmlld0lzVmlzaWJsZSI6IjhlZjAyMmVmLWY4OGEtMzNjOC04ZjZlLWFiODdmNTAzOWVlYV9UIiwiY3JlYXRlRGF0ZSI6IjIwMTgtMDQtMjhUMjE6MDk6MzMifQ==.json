It was an extremely good film, but felt like more build up for the real movie which will be coming out in the following May. There is nothing wrong with that, but this movie was built up to be so much more than it was. The film was all fighting and gave no time for characters old and new to connect or re-connect with one another.","displayName":"Vincent A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/648436465304913/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T21:08:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T21:10:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"974320057","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vincent A","accountLink":"/user/id/974320057"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing!!
