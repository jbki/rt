The movie explores basic themes such as the significance of life and the meaning of sacrifice. The interaction between the characters is fun to watch even though the comedic parts of the movie are based heavily on the character calling each other funny names. The story is hard to grasp for people who aren't familiar with the marvel franchise and though most scenes are visually spectacular the movie does rely a great deal on cgi. In conclusion Avengers Infinity War is another solid entry in the series, that ends on an excellently placed cliff hanger and secures Marvel as one of the unstoppable juggernauts of the film industry.","displayName":"Aidan B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-24T17:41:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-24T18:23:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"977234552","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aidan B","accountLink":"/user/id/977234552"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Marvel movie yet!
