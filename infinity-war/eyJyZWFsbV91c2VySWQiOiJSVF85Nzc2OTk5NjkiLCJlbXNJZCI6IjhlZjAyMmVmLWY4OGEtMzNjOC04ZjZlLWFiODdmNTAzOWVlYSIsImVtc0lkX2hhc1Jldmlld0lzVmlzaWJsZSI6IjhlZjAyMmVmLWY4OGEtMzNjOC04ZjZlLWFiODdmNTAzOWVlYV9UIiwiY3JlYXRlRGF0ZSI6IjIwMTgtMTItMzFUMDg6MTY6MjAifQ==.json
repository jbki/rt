I would have liked it even more if I had seen all the other Marvel movies. But either way I enjoyed it. The action throughout was fun but some things just weren't logical relating to their powers. I found Dr. Strange's arm movements silly for some reason. I thought the ending was pretty great.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-31T05:06:47.861Z","updateDate":"2018-12-31T05:06:47.861Z","user":{"userId":"968234361","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/968234361"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 31, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"I mean if I actually watched and liked Marvel movies I'd probably say this was good.
