If you want some sort of a decent plot with the typical Ironman humor, then not so much. Way too long with very little going on. How all that action can be boring, I don't know, but it's boring.  Finally a crappy ending caps it off.  Perhaps the inevitable sequel will fix things.","displayName":"Kelly P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T23:48:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T23:19:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"975049829","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kelly P","accountLink":"/user/id/975049829"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent Movie is Amagazine","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1686714658063104/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T23:44:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T23:45:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"977244798","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977244798"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"They did it.  10 years of build up and it did not disappoint.
