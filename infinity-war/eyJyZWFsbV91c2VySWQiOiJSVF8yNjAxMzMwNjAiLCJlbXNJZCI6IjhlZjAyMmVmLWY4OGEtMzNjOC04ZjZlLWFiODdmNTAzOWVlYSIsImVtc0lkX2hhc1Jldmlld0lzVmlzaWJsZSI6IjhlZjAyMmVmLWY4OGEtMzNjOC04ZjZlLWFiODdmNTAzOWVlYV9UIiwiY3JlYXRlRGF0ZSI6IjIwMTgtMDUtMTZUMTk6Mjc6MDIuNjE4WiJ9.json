Great story, action, special effects, etc...  The interactions between ALL OF THE MANY characters was well done, the ending was unexpected (the head Thor, the head) and got me a bit choked up (here's looking at your Spidey). I look forward to the resolution of this conflict with the next Avengers movie.","displayName":"Lawrence N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-16T18:50:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T18:53:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"977271859","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lawrence N","accountLink":"/user/id/977271859"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Some people will say its too long, however I cant think of any parts that could be left out, its a kick ass Superhero flick with almost all of your favourite superheroes on one screen. Its great to see a Villian that you can actually fear but also in a sick way sympathize with. Let me be clear....its not going to win academy awards, acting is good buuut thats not the reason we are watching The Avengers....again its a kick ass movie that will leave you heartbroken yet entertained. It has all the ingredients that a HUGE summer blockbuster should have yet this installment feels alot darker. Directors done an amazing job bringing all the characters together and matching them up according to her personality. definitely worth the watch.......maybe 20or 3 times :)","displayName":"Thaabiet D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-16T18:43:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T18:52:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"911034847","realm":"RT","displayName":"Thaabiet D","accountLink":"/user/id/911034847"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome movie and good attempt on the Thanos villain character development within the time allotted with so many different story arcs.","displayName":"Mark L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-16T18:31:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T18:32:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"976986677","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark L","accountLink":"/user/id/976986677"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Dull & slow.

The whole plot relies on each set of heroes doing something completely stupid and tactically unsound for their characters to further the story while ignoring their power levels from previous movies. The blatantly false ads where Hulk is in Wakanda play up like the Hulk will be in it more than he actually is leading to disappointment when you are stuck with Mark Ruffalo more often. Sorry Mark there are already 3 or more people in Armor suits slapping Bruce in the Hulk Buster is not interesting. This movie turned Hulk into a big green bitch. They completely role back character powers from previous films and have them go on unneeded side quests. Thor going after Storm Breaker. He runs off to that place unaware that storm breaker would be able to use the bifrost. So how exactly did he expect to get to Earth? Tony Stark charges off by himself expecting to take on Thanos completely unaware of Spider-Man and sends him off at least once. Neither of the three Ironman , Strange or Spider-Man expect to meet the Guardians of the Galaxy so what was their big plan? Dr Strange and his assistant stopped using portals after their first sequence and never really tapped into any of the shit they were doing in Doctor Strange's Solo Movie. Ironman pretty much was cranked up to stupid levels of power being far beyond Hulk , Spider-man and Odin Level Powered Thor.  Shield or any kind of human retaliation was just gone make it a very weird situation. Wakanda stepped up but seemed to go with a rather low tech option than what I expected. \n\nOverall the movie was overhyped and just lacked the excitement of previous installments. There really weren't any great memorable action sequences like Winter Soldier or Age of Ultron with the combat sequences being interweaved between characters into one shot. The only part coming close might be when they try to capture Thanos on Titan. I guess until then I will wait for fans to make fan edits or fan trailers to give me something that lives up to the hype.","displayName":"Todd C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000065682987/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-16T15:23:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T15:39:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"896359021","realm":"RT","displayName":"Todd C","accountLink":"/user/id/896359021"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Avengers: Infinity War works more as a prelude to what's coming next than a full movie. The Russo brothers have managed to pull a feat no less than what the others in the MCU have already brought to us, but being more ambitious this time with all superheroes in their 10 year culmination.\n\nMy only gripe is that Infinity War's story is a big cliffhanger and it doesn't resolve much by the time the end credits roll. It just sets the stage for Avengers 4 due for release in 2019. But even on its own, Infinity War has plenty of style and substance for the audience.
