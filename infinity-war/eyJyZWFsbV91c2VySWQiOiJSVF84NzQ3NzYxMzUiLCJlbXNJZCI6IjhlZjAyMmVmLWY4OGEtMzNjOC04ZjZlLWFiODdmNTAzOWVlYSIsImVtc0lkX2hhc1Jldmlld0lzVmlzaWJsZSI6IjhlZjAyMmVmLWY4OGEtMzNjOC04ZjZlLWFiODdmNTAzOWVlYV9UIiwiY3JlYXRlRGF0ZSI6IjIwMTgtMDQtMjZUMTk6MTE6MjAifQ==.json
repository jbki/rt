Infinity wars was a great movie we have waited all these years to see Thanos come and cause havoc and he did not disappoint the way he smashed Hulk at the beginning and then went on to put a beat down on the rest of the Avengers was great. You can tell that everyone from the actors to the people who made the coffee runs worked extra hard to make this movie a great  movie. The film looked amazing every thing was on point.The biggest shock tp me was when Redskull made a brief cameo appearance . The action was awesome and their was just enough comedy but it didn't bog down the movie. The only beef I had with the movie was no Hawkeye or Antman they needed to atleast have a small cameo. Look this movie was about Thanos and his road to capture the Infinity stones  and they did a very good job doing so. Everytime a Avengers movie comes out the bar gets raised high so part 4 has its work cut out and I can't wait to see it","displayName":"corey s","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T19:08:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-17T11:00:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"966212931","realm":"RT","displayName":"corey s","accountLink":"/user/id/966212931"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Greatest movie of all time!!!! 100% recommended!
