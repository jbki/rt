The reason I was going to mark it down slightly isbecause some of the action scenes were in shaky cam and were very fast and so I couldn't pick out some of the detail of the action. However I watched the film in 2D only not 4K so that may have been my fault. Moving on to the film. This film is more than the sum of it's parts. The actual substance of the film and the writing, we may have seen better in other Marvel films. However this film just oozes prestige and grandeour from it's pores. In the same essence that Mad Max: Fury Road is a chase scene action sequence for it's entire run time, Avengers: Infinity War achieves the same thing in a new way. This film is basically an arching action sequence for it's entire run time. That is a massive achievement in cinema. That's not to say that the plot is not well developed and professionally dispersed throught the film also. Marvel achieve both in this movie to an excellent standard. Thanos is not just a prediuctable villain. He is powerful, has on screen prescence and is intelligent. There is also a lot of humour in this movie. Which is a bold move for a film with such a dark and serious tone. However again Marvel showcase the humour in this movie masterfully and pull it off with great aplomb. There are so many legendary characters in this movie and for that all to run smoothly and be the entertainment spectacle that it was is a massive achievement. It is also very bold for a major cinema event to end on a cliff hanger. Yes we have plenty of franchises in cinema but very rarely do we see a cliff hanger and again I believe this is a brave thing for Marvel cinema to do. Apart from all that the Children Of Thanos deserve special mention, I thought they were excellent characters. This movie is a major event people will still be talking about this film and watching this film 40 years from now. The film oozes prestige and legend.

The casting is huge, the marketing huge and the years in the making were many. A lot of pressure to sustain and to deliver such a brilliant film out of that pressure takes skill. Thor and the Guardians should join forces as there interactions are comedy gold. All of our favourite characters get sufficient screen time and those that don't will feature more in the next film. Once the action and fun and laughter dust settles you will find the last 20 minutes move you, shock you and bewilder you, leaving you sat frozen looking at the screen thinking... did that just happen? Best Marvel movie to date not including Guardians of the galaxy as that is in a realm of brilliance on its own.","displayName":"Liam M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/775017957/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-14T23:34:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-14T23:34:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"815687262","realm":"RT","displayName":"Liam M","accountLink":"/user/id/815687262"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"It was a mediocre movie, I found the plot really frustrating because Vision becomes this useless character who everyone has to depend on, the plot felt flimsy but the ending was definitely not expected whatsoever.","displayName":"Sam S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-14T22:56:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-14T22:59:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"922153691","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sam S","accountLink":"/user/id/922153691"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fantastic opus to everything we've been building toward for the last decade+ int he MCU. Thanos is great, all the characters feel like they have a place and have a voice that they need. It has some surprises that may be a little jarring to some, but those that read comics can enjoy the inclusion of some characters that feel right at home in the kind of comic story-arcs we can deliver. I immediately wanted to see it again and can't wait for the follow up to finish out the story.","displayName":"Matt S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-14T21:56:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-14T21:58:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"976954673","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt S","accountLink":"/user/id/976954673"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A+++ Movie // Great narrative // Russo Brothers handled all of these characters with great talent.
