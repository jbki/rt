Thanos's might was real and not implied just the way the comic depicts. Excellent job in not falling prey to the soft desires of movie watchers today who want every script to have a fairy tale ending. Sometimes the bad guy wins as is the case in life. 10 years of waiting and worth its weight in gold. A must see best Avengers. The bar is now beyond the mark. Another level of Marvel excellence will be indeed infinity!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T23:21:47.554Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T23:25:21.796Z","user":{"userId":"963581600","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/963581600"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"very good...but didnt exploit most of the characters powers for fight scenes...the hulk being scared...you could have left him out.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T23:17:34.376Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T22:51:46.743Z","user":{"userId":"910529447","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/910529447"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie gets right into action, grips your attention and doesn't let go.

Still felt could have been better. \nAlthough the ensemble can never get enough screen time. \nI felt disappointed when Cap didn't get enough action and dialogues. Felt that he was just participating. \nThor's Hammer shouldn't be held by wood. Should have had vibranium Stick. Although every moment of the movie was just amazing and have to give credit to makers to have audience left behind in shock.. \nThanos was fabulous and felt he just was mad man with a genuine reason to gain the infinity Gems. \nThe wait for next movie seems wrong... Just wrong.. and long.. Russo's could have worked on that. I hope Marvel doesnt let Kevin move out as he is a visionary. I think he should move out and start working with DC Comics. I am even waiting for the vast ensemble of Disney and Fox characters to come together. I have even heard Wolverine is in Avengers 4. I hope its true.","displayName":"Jim T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T23:04:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T23:15:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"909821762","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jim T","accountLink":"/user/id/909821762"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"}]}
