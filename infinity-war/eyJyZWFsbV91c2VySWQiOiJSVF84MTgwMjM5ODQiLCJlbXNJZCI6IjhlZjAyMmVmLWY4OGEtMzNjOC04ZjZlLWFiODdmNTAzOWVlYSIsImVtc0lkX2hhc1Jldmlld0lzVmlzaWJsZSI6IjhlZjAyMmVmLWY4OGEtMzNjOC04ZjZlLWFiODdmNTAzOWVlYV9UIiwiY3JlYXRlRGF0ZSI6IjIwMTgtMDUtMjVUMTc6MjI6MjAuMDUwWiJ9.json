Thanos was the villain that decades of build up\nfinally earned. He not only proved to be incredibly intimidating but also with some heart. He was not just a killer, he has a goal, to balance the universe, and the\nheroes of the Universe are in the way. With every single film culminating into this, there was so much to live up to, and it did so. Every character was represented \nexcellently. The women were given many epic scenes including the finale's insanity. The ending of the film was the best option that could have come out in this. Some\npeople were angered by it, but not even they realize that once the fourth film comes out, their spirits will be enlightened. There were some moments that had me \nscratching my head, like when Peter is angered by Thanos on Titan, many of the people there could have stopped Quill, but instead, nothing happened. One of the \nbiggest surprises of the film was the return of Red Skull, who was sadly not reprised by Hugo Weaving. There were no major lows of the film, small ones that did not\nmajorly affect the grading of the film. Now we must wait a year until we see part two and the end of the Infinity War. This film was fun, heartbreaking and exhaugsted.\nAll in all, nearly perfect.","displayName":"Mason M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-25T15:22:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-25T15:25:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977289065","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mason M","accountLink":"/user/id/977289065"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"What a disaster.

Thor (surprisingly for me) and Stark took MVPs for written characters. Some hammy acting here n there (especially from Dinklage, among others), but then that's chalkable to comic book theatrics. Overall a fun ride. B- P.S. SPOILER: It was pretty astounding how they went from small loss to small loss repeatedly and then ultimately settled in what I'd amount to a draw; But then I think there's something to be gleaned from where they're left.
