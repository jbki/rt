The film is an incredible achievement and proof that the Russo’s are the masters of comic book films.

This was an emotionally and visually charged roller coaster that just kept feeding the reason you go to the movies.  Finally a challenge for the Avengers that isn't just part of the story line.  Thanos was brilliantly written and acted.  I'm glad we don't have to wait 3 years for the follow up.  \n\nVery well done Marvel!!!!","displayName":"Jason R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T05:06:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T05:12:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241877","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jason R","accountLink":"/user/id/977241877"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
