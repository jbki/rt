Best villain Marvel has done.  Vader, Joker good.  And this movie is all about the villain.  The movie is Thanos's story.  The scope of this movie is unlike anything we have seen before.  And how the story works with so many characters is impressive.  It is really a cinematic experience. With that said the huge scope and so many character does prevent it from being an all time great movie.  It is very good, but not at the same level as Black Panther, Wonder Woman, Logan or the first Avengers movie.  Saw it twice.  Late Friday with an adult audience and a Saturday matinee with a mixed audience with more young adults and kids.  With the adult audience it was more of silenced shock of WTF just happened as the end credits rolled. The younger audience you really heard the gasps and tears and a felling of more trauma as the credits roles.  The end credits scene is worth the wait and important to what comes next.  I think I will be seeing this 2 or 3 more times in the theater.  So yeah I liked it.","displayName":"Jim P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1113314068/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T12:56:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T12:56:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"846544454","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jim P","accountLink":"/user/id/846544454"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Infinity War was not original or exciting in any sense of the words.
