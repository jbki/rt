If you haven’t seen any of the Marvel movies before this you will be totally lost. It was very funny in places but on one occasion the joke came straight after something which should have had a bigger impact on the audience. The interaction between the heroes where very well done and the introduction of the Thanos family I found enjoyable. My biggest problem was Thanos himself I could not get past it was Josh Brolin in CGI. I never got this in the previous movies like Ultron but for some reason all I saw was Brolin. He also suffers from bad guy syndrome that he is not as interesting as the writers try to make him he is just any villain who thinks he can make the universe a better place. The writers also seemed to forget that this is an Avengers movie and not another Spider-man or Guardians of the Galaxy. I felt so sorry for Captain America I am not sure how many words he had but I would be surprised if it was more than ten. There is a certain relationship that has been building up in certain pervious movies and here they got the big pay off which did not work and if it was going to be in there original movies would have been much better. The ending was also a big let down as we are aware that the characters which we supposed to be gone had no impact as we know that there is no way that marvel would allow them to be gone for long. So this was a big setup for part 2 which I can’t say I am really looking forward to.

Movie was disappointing and completely waste of time. I don't understand why people are saying this movie was really amazing. It sucks, totally. I fall asleep while watching it.
