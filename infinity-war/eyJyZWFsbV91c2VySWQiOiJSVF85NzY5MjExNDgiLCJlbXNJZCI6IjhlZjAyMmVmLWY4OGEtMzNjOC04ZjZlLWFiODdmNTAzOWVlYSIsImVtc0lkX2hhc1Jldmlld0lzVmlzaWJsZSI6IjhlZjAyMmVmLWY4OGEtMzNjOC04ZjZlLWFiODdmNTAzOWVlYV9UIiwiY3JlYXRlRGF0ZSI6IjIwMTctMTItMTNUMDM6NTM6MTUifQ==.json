Avengers: Infinity War is a game changing spectacle with a lot of great fun action and sad emotional moments. Thankfully, you really feel for Thanos (Josh Brolin) and you kind of understand his point of view. SPOILERS AHEAD DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED. Killing this many characters on screen in this manner is truly unexpected, I really hope everyone returns because of the Time Stone or something because, wow I'm shocked. Spider-Man's (Tom Holland) death was truly heartbreaking and Gamora's (Zoe Saldana) also. I like that they don't beat Thanos (Josh Brolin) yet and that we need to see another Avengers movie, it isn't as simple as some think. It has some great character development and a really intriguing plot. Avengers Infinity War lives up to the hype and even exceeds its hype. Best movie in the MCU so far.","displayName":"Merijn J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-12T10:13:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-21T05:47:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"976493206","realm":"RT","displayName":"Merijn J","accountLink":"/user/id/976493206"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Going in a big fan of what the Russo bros. did with Winter Soldier and Civil War, I was generally disappointed in Infinity War. While there were moments of cool, there was just too much time spent on spectacle and not enough on character. The tonal qualities between the GoTG aspects and the Avengers elements did not mix well. It felt like too many of the comic crossovers it was based on, suffering from a forced, mish-mash of styles and story. Looking back across the 18 or 19 movies leading up to this, I think the flaw was focusing on the infinity stones as the tie-in aspect, when they could have made more use of the Black Order (which was one of the better aspects of this movie) so we had villains we cared about as much as the heroes.\n\nUltimately, making this movie at all was a gutsy play, especially the ending. I saw it coming, and it still meant the two hours leading up to it were pointless, and it pissed of several people at the movie with me who were not expecting it, don't know the comics and did not appreciate the bleakness of it. Again, this was tonally disconnected from everything else. Also, when you know certain characters aren't really dead, because they have sequels already planned, trying for that level of gravitas just fails out right. \n\nUp until now, the Russo bros. have managed to come at the genre with interesting twists, and that was completely lacking here... being \"just a superhero movie\" and lacking the thematic depth of the really good Marvel movies that preceded them. It will take a seriously impressive and original script and plot in Avengers 4 to avoid making this worse, let alone redeeming it. If it all just ends up another \"and time travel makes it all go away\" story (I really, really hope not) then they've all but ruined the entire franchise.","displayName":"Neil C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-12T10:09:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T05:44:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"976790428","realm":"RT","displayName":"Neil C","accountLink":"/user/id/976790428"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish","displayName":"Harry R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-11T17:02:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T03:25:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"973004959","realm":"RT","displayName":"Harry R","accountLink":"/user/id/973004959"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Truthfully, I was underwhelmed.
