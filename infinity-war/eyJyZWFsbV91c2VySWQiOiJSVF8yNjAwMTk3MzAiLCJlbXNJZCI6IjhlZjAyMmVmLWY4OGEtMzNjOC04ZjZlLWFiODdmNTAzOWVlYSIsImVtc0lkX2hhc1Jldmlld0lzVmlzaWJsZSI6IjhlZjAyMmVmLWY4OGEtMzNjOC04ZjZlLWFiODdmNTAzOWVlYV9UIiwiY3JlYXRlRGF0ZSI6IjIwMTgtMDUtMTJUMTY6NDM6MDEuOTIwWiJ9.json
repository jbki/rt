The plot and character were great, and the entire theater was stunned into silence at the end. I was crying the hardest and trying to wipe away my tears before anyone saw me. I love the relationship between Tony and Peter and was so happy to see Peter in this film. The humor was actually funny (sorry Guardians of the Galaxy 2) and yes . . . people died.

It was all over the place, but in a good way. I enjoyed the way it moved around through the different heroes fighting their different battles in different locations. It felt united and perfectly tied together. The theater was a jumble of emotions and reactions and the ending left everyone silent and a little shocked. The comedy parts were hilarious, the action scenes were amazing. It was an amazing movie and I wish we didn't have to wait a year for the next. My kids absolutely loved it and time flew by so fast watching the movie that my youngest didn't complain even once. Amazing movie.

Basic premise that Thanos wants half of people in the universe dead because of overpopulation is stupid. These people travel amongst the stars and obviously have technology to either move the people from overcrowded planets or do something else. The movie relies on unnecessary action and violence to fill thin script. As for acting there was none. Everyone is wooden and just talk like George Lucas wrote their lines. I don't want to go and complain about political correctness as that stupidity is common and mandatory for Disney's movies now. Cheap ending that guarantees next movie where everyone will be resurrected. I would give it a single star star but you cannot expect much from Marvel so they get 2 :(","displayName":"Nikola V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-12T15:39:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-12T15:49:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"977266166","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nikola V","accountLink":"/user/id/977266166"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"May 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Its....a movie. Honestly, its kind of bad. Story is incredibly slow, too many characters to feel any connection to any of them, except maybe Thanos who somehow ends up feeling like the most sympathetic character by the end. Even the set pieces are mostly forgettable which isn't usually the case in these movies. Also pretty sure I know how the next one will work out already, which is disappointing.","displayName":"Jeffrey O","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1413482401/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-12T15:34:00.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-12T15:39:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"840073561","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeffrey O","accountLink":"/user/id/840073561"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"The Avengers barely did anything to save civilization in this movie and they didn't do their best to protect the stones. They basically just gave the stones up to the bad guy and the hulk didn't do a single thing.

This allows me to feel for all the characters and even when not agreeing with him i can follow his logic and see his desperation. overall i recommend this movie to people who have seen the rest of the mcu. the only real negative is the lack of stakes or losses in the creation of stormbreaker.","displayName":"Matthew W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100005614294995/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-12T15:06:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-12T15:13:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"962054506","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew W","accountLink":"/user/id/962054506"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Marvel film yet.
