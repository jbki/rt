Wow! A real villain who was about business at all costs, about time! We all know what will happen in the next movie, but it was good to see a villain live up to all the hype. Finally! Thanos was a real bad a** who took no prisoners. The best Avengers movie yet. To me the weakest part of the movie was the Wakanda scenes, but it didn't really detract from the overall movie. Great job Marvel from start to finish!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T01:35:48.061Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T01:35:48.061Z","user":{"userId":"923992215","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/923992215"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wow!

This movie is mind blowing, so much so that I've seen it twice in the two days it's been out and liked it even more the second time. I wont say too much other than that the Russo's/writers perfectly handle every character and give many there best moments yet. It's hilarious, emotional, and ends amazingly. I couldn't ask for more and not only is this my favorite marvel movie now, it's just one of my favorite movies.
