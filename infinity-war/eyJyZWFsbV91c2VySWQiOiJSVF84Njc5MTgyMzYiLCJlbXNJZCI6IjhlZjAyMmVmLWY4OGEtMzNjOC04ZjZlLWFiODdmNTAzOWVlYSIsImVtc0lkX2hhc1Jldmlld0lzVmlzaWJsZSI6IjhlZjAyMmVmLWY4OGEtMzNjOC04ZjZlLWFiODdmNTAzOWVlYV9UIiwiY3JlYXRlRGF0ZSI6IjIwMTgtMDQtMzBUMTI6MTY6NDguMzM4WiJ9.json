No other film in cinema history has combined this many characters and stories into one cinematic conglomerate meant to tie everything together. Because of that, many of what was supposed to be the films most emotional moments were not able to be as fully explored as they needed to be, but at 2hrs and 30 minutes long, they risked the whole experience becoming more of a chore. However, they did it better than any other studio could even dream of. Spectacle and nostalgia was center stage for this Avengers, and if you were expecting anything less, you should've done some research. Just prepare yourself for a roller-coaster of emotions while leaving the theater.

It handles the multitude of characters well, while still centering on Thanos.

I was unbelievable disappointed and am left to question why they didn't sell it as a Part 1.  If they had, I would have went in expecting something closer to what they delivered, and would have enjoyed it.  I have been to every Marvel movie since (and including) Iron Man in theaters because Marvel always delivered what they advertised and it was always good.  I went to Spider Man Homecoming and Ant Man just because they had Marvel behind them- never would have gone otherwise.  Pretty bummed about Infinity War and consequently won't be seeing any of the next three in theaters.  Maybe when they hit Red Box...","displayName":"Matt F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T11:51:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T11:51:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"977251067","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt F","accountLink":"/user/id/977251067"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie I personally think it's the best work yet.

There was a sense of desperation and urgency because of the overwhelming power of Thanos and his crew. They were vicious, not like usual super villains, where you can see exploits in weaknesses. This was on an entirely new level and the despair was palpable. The heroes all got good screen time and the action was not over-paced and busy without a breather. The Russo Brothers brought their \"A\" game and did not let up. I already have tickets to see it again. Yep! it's one of those movies.","displayName":"Alton K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T11:49:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T09:30:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"966790350","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alton K","accountLink":"/user/id/966790350"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Avengers Infinity war was a true mash-up of everything a superhero movie needs. Action, romance, drama, and heartbreak. It left us, the audience, shaken and impatient for the next installment to the Avengers series. It was equally as thriling and cinimatic as it was heartbreaking. This is by far the best movie as of now to every be created because it teaches us that not every problem can be solved and that sometimes the bad guys win.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2153629454867361/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T11:49:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T12:00:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"977251064","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977251064"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"}]}
