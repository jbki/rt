There's some real demonstration of powers going on here. And that's great, it really is. The problem is, that's almost all there is. It pretty much opens with an action sequence and doesn't ever stop. As a consequence, there's a lack of character development and quieter, more dramatic moments to anchor the film and let you catch your breath. I hesitate to say it's action overload, (but it's action overload) but the effect is somewhat numbing where each fight has less of an impact than the last. Now, that's not to say there aren't any dramatic scenes at all and it's the few that do exist, such as those exploring Thanos as a person, that are the most powerful and impactful. That being said, it's all been building towards this moment and they had to fit a ridiculous amount of events, locations and people into one film -- with that in mind, it's amazing they managed to not make a complete mess of it, let alone make something that's this entertaining.","displayName":"Late R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-23T17:23:09.000Z","updateDate":"2018-11-17T17:43:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"976628202","realm":"RT","displayName":"Late R","accountLink":"/user/id/976628202"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 23, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Just wow!
