Josh Brolin is Thanos was phenomenal choice. The story is very close to the original comic books stays loyal to its fan base and its source material and in all things on her Stan Lee, Marvel's creator. Star Wars Disney keep on going!

Just enough action, and just enough comedy to tie it all together... I would give it 5 stars but sometimes it was a bit confusing because of the jumping from people to people.

Thanos is by far one of the best villians of all time. Each character is balanced perfectly, in a very near flawless story. The first and third act are made beautifully while the second act can become a little slow but is still very intriguing. The stakes real and you will be at the edge of your seat throughout the film. Visually this movie is amazing the CGI is flawless and the script is very well done. Easily one of the best MCU films. 9.6/10","displayName":"Gordon B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-22T10:25:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-22T10:28:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"977321236","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gordon B","accountLink":"/user/id/977321236"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 22, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A-MAzing!!!
