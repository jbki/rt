A movie with so many characters and so much hype from fans, I was nervous it would fail. Instead, it left me speechless and hoping for more. It is absolutely giant, which makes it one of the most rewatchable movies ever (I've rewatched it many times already and still love it). With a great mix of funny quips, incredible action, and emotional scenes, it has to be up there with (Dare I say) The Dark Knight as one of the greatest superhero movies ever made.","displayName":"Jess C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-21T21:52:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-21T22:01:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"977674974","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jess C","accountLink":"/user/id/977674974"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I wish superheroes would be superheroes not comedians.

It also brings together a ton of stories throughout the MCU.\n\nThe beginning of the movie is an extension to the end of Ragnarok. The movie officially brings Doctor Strange into the bigger conflict. The movie embraces Iron Man's overpoweredness (rather than playing it off as a fluke from Age of Ultron), and makes it Tony's downfall. It provides a great character arc for Bruce and Steve. It gives a purpose for this new broken Thor. It provides a great reason for the Guardians of the Galaxy to be involved in this at all, especially with Gamora and Nebula. It establishes a relationship between Vision and Wanda. It expands our knowledge of Wakanda and just how smart the people there are. And finally, this movie does all this, plus a subversive ending....and none of it feels forced. It all feels perfectly natural to the overall story being told here. \n\nCan't wait for Avengers 4.","displayName":"Alex R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-21T17:48:28.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-18T18:36:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"977674477","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex R","accountLink":"/user/id/977674477"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Avengers: Infinity War is my favorite film in the MCU. The action is on-point, the quippy moments are funny, and the ending got me teary-eyed. It's the kind the movie that leaves you wanting more, and it makes you feel excited for what's coming up next.

It's half a story, it has too many characters to focus on... and yet somehow marvel sticks the landing with a poise we've yet to see in the superhero genre.  Just don't count on this one making a lick of sense if you've not put in the time to see the previous chapters.","displayName":"Anakin S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-21T06:06:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-21T06:10:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"977296737","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anakin S","accountLink":"/user/id/977296737"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Don't know where to start. Avengers: Infinity War is one of the biggest cinematic events in our generation. A timeline and build up of that scale have never been executed better. The movie breaks boundaries with the rare \"Sad Ending\". It left us with a cliffhanger but after all its a two parter. The characters had balanced screen times and Thanos felt like a grounded real life character. His motives were clear and he didn't stop until he achieved his goal. Didn't think a movie of this scale can be pulled off. The Russo Brothers did not disappoint.","displayName":"Antoan P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-20T21:42:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-20T21:49:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"977672582","realm":"RT","displayName":"Antoan P","accountLink":"/user/id/977672582"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Avengers: Infinity War, the culmination of what 20 films have been leading up to, truly is the most ambitious cinematic superhero crossover event of the year.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/336827080118116/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-20T15:04:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-20T15:15:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"976886965","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976886965"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I want to tell you about this movie it is called Avengers Infinity War. If I would rate this movie I rate it 5 stars, here's why. The movie has a lot of action and all of the actors fit in well, when I see the fighting scenes I feel like i'm there. The movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and every single part of that 2 hour and 20 minutes are action with a very good story line. I would suggest watching the prior sequels of the avenger movies. The sounds feel real, for example the guns, spaceships and when they go to the planets they look real everything looks real in the movie, this is for sure the best movie of 2018, I recommend this movie to everyone go watch it right now!","displayName":"Abdullah N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-20T10:36:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-20T10:37:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"977671574","realm":"RT","displayName":"Abdullah N","accountLink":"/user/id/977671574"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"explosive, thrilling and entertaining, Avengers: Infinite War entertains the viewer with the unexpected union of all the heroes of the Marvel film universe, and with magnificent action scenes and CGI's jaw-dropping, although a large number of characters are no longer used. 8.5/10","displayName":"joshua d","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-20T05:08:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-28T03:17:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"976644243","realm":"RT","displayName":"joshua d","accountLink":"/user/id/976644243"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2018"}]}
