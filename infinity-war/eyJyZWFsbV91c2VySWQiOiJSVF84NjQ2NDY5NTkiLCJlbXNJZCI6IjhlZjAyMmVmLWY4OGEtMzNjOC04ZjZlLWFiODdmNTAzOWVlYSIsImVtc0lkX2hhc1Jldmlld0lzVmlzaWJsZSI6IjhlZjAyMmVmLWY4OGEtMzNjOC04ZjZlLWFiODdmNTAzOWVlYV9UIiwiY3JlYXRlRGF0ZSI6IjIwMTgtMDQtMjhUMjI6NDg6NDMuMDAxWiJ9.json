A friend who went with me thought it was too much and, while I see where he’s coming from, he hadn’t seen every Marvel movie, which isn’t a requirement to follow this story, but it helps get certain references, jokes, and backstory.

This movie is the ultimate reward for people who have been closely following the MCU, yet it might be a bit convoluted for casual viewers. As someone who grew up with the MCU, I adore Infinity War for its brilliant character interactions and thrilling actions sequences. Hopefully Avengers 4 will be the satisfying conclusion to this arc.","displayName":"Bill G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T22:40:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T18:50:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"976874181","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bill G","accountLink":"/user/id/976874181"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"even though it maked me angry becase my 2 favorites..... but i still enjoyed it","displayName":"paula r","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T22:39:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T22:41:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"977129798","realm":"RT","displayName":"paula r","accountLink":"/user/id/977129798"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"the best...is a masive accion... they have anyting... is a up and down of emotion... noting like that...","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10213824196546568/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T22:38:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T22:41:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247482","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977247482"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best damn marvel movie to date!!","displayName":"Webb M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000074953472/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T22:38:02.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T22:40:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"969037231","realm":"RT","displayName":"Webb M","accountLink":"/user/id/969037231"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"All the past decade's Marvel movies have been heading toward this showdown, turns out the payoff was worth the wait.
