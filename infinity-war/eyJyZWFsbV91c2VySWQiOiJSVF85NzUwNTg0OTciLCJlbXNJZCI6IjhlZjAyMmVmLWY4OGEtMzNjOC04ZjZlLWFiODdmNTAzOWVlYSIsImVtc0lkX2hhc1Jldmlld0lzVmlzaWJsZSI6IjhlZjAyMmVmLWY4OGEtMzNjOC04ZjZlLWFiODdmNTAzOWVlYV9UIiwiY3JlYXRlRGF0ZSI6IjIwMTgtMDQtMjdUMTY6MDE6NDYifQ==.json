But the raw emotions felt in this movie between the character and with Thanos himself is stunning. He probably outranks Loki and Ultron as my favourite villain. His goal is simple and logically makes sense, he feels pain and has made sacrifices to get to where is he by the end of the film.","displayName":"Hannah V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T15:55:09.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T16:05:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243690","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hannah V","accountLink":"/user/id/977243690"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"This was definitely one of the most ambitious movies ever made. The acting was great, and the fx good.the reason why it only gets three and a half stars, is that everyone dies. If marvel is going to continue their cinematic universe, the sequel will need to be just as ambitious as this.","displayName":"Liam G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T15:54:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T16:01:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243689","realm":"RT","displayName":"Liam G","accountLink":"/user/id/977243689"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Avengers: Infinity War is a thrill ride of a movie, tossing you from one action sequence to the next in rapid succession, and I loved almost every minute of it. Most of the characters get sufficient screen time, which given the sheer amount of characters isn't a lot, but everyone does make some impact. Standouts were Iron Man, Spiderman, Thor, and most of the Guardians. Wakanda and the Black Panther crew are kind of sidelined here, I think mainly because Marvel had no idea how big that movie world be before this one was finished, so I can understand it, even though it was a little disappointing. Most of their scenes are in the trailers.\nBut THANOS! Oh my god Thanos is a great villain. he's very intimidating, but has a lot of pathos. Josh Brolin does a great job with the performance and the CGI on him is AMAZING. The VFX all around were amazing, and some of the best Marvel's done.\nReally I only have two main problems with this movie, one is a small problem which I can tell openly, but the other is a bigger problem that I can't bring up without getting into spoilers. \nThe first problem is that this movie pretty much relies on the fact that you've seen almost all the marvel movies to date. if you're not caught up in the MCU, a lot of this movie night confuse you. Basically you need to have seen everything except Incredible Hulk, Ant-Man, and maybe Iron Man 3. Since I've seen all the marvel movies except Incredible Hulk, it wasn't really a problem for me. but for someone who doesn't know the whole story, it might be an issue.\nAnyway, that's my (non-spoilery) thoughts on it! if you've seen the movie or don't care about spoilers you can keep reading, otherwise, go see it! It's pretty damn good.\nMy second problem is (SPOILERS!!!!!):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGamora's death and the way the Soul Stone was revealed really bothered me. I think it really did a disservice to her character to have Thanos just throw her off the cliff (out of \"true love\" nonetheless). I think it would have been so much more interesting to have the Soul Stone be one of the Avengers' souls. It would have been a more dramatic payoff for the team as well as the audience. As is, you can pretty much predict what's going to happen as soon as they get to that cliff.","displayName":"Max L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T15:54:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T16:00:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"921056499","realm":"RT","displayName":"Max L","accountLink":"/user/id/921056499"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing villain and bold moves... if they stick.","displayName":"Sabrina P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100008423534790/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T15:54:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T15:59:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"969964463","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sabrina P","accountLink":"/user/id/969964463"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolute master piece of film. 10 years have lead p to this and it just didn't meet my unrealistic expectations, it exceeded them!
