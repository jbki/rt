I feel a sequel in the near future ( Duh !) I dont want to say too much but dont leave the theatre when the credits roll ! Reading some of the critics negative reviews , are they kidding ? Picking the movie apart as if you are comparing it to Shakespeare! Can you imagine some of these people as kids at Christmas ? “ Mommy i dont feel this train set truly reflects my taste in toys right now “ Geeez ! Sometimes you have to just enjoy a movie as fun in the moment !! This is an enjoyable fun movie !!

These characters have been around so long, they're like family to us.
