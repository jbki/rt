I laughed more during this movie more than even the original Avengers, it is dark and light hearted without being inconsistent in tone. Some CGI problems but most of the movie looks beautiful. Oh yeah and Thanos is awesome.","displayName":"Davis B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-27T07:25:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-27T07:30:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"977292516","realm":"RT","displayName":"Davis B","accountLink":"/user/id/977292516"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A brilliant marvel movie, the one we have been waiting for , with a shock twist ending","displayName":"Affirmed J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-27T06:54:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-27T06:54:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"977292478","realm":"RT","displayName":"Affirmed J","accountLink":"/user/id/977292478"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was the best I've seen in a long time","displayName":"Mitchell G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/742831585767525/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-27T06:38:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-27T06:38:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"976217075","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mitchell G","accountLink":"/user/id/976217075"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Way to juggle all those characters (way better than Avengers 2).

What I mean is that there was a time skip that isn't entirely clear. Anyways, is Antman and The Wasp taking place before or after Infinity War?\nNext, there is the plot. The plot, in the simplest way stated, made some sense. However, everything sort of got confusing at the end. And besides, I found the end credit scene to be a better conclusion than the movie's ending.\nAlso, the heroes of this movie do some really stupid things.\nAlso, I liked any of the other MCU movies I've watched more.\nAlso, too much death.","displayName":"Benne%20 A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-27T05:19:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-27T05:27:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"977292349","realm":"RT","displayName":"Benne%20 A","accountLink":"/user/id/977292349"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Best Avenger movie yet ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-27T05:17:10.229Z","updateDate":"2018-05-27T05:17:10.229Z","user":{"userId":"909237209","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/909237209"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Pretty insane ride!
