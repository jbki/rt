Beyond that Thanos is without question the best villain the MCU has ever had.\nEveryone gets a chance to shine which says something incredible about the Russo brothers as filmmakers and that ending will break you.\nThis really does feel like a worthy culmination of all the MCU movies we've seen thus far, it's the history of the characters, the relationships they have with each other, what they stand for, it all comes together and lets the movie just knock the wind out of you.","displayName":"Dafydd M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T02:01:32.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T02:02:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"962211410","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dafydd M","accountLink":"/user/id/962211410"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Stellar performances combined with a frighteningly logical villain.
