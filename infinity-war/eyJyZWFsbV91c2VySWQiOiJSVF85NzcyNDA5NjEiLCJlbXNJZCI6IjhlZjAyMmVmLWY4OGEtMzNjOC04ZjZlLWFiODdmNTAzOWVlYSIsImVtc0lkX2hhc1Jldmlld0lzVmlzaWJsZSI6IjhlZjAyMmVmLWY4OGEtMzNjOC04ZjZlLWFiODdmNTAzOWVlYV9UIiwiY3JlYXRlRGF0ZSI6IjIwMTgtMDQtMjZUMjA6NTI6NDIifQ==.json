Essentially character buildup is not needed, but there was very little interaction with the characters for the story. Any interaction had to be quick due to timing.  However, the movie does a spectacular job setting up the different battle scenes where it culminates the final battle. Thanos becomes my favorite villain and the CGI is done extremely well whereas  some recent movies *cough JL failed. Thanos becomes very convincing and you even feel for him at times. I can't wait for the next installment and thanks for the best cliffhanger ever!","displayName":"Carlos D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T20:49:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T04:03:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"911973571","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carlos D","accountLink":"/user/id/911973571"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It might very well be the best event movie I've ever seen.

Seriously, this results in a feat that is hitherto unrivaled when discussing the fine facial expression. I thoroughly appreciated the nuanced smirks and gradual changes which add a humanistic dimension to a villain. Coupled with compelling screen time, this is probably the most realized Marvel villain I have seen. I applaud the screenwriters for incorporating Thanos in a way that transcends the typical villain archetype. I am sincerely awestruck with how well Thanos is done in this feature. \n\tThat written, this is an amalgamation of most Marvel story arcs and with this approach, comes a bevy of issues associated with the general Marvel story arc. Each story arc will feature a Deus ex Machina conveniently placed to save a specific character and given that you will be subjected to multiple story arcs in a rinse-repeat fashion. As such, you will be subjected to very convenient (almost too convenient) plot devices that feel too scripted and may have you questioning the logistics behind the screenplay. That written, despite the plethora of big names attached to this feature, I feel that Paul Bettany stood out as Vision, Chris Hemsworth a close second, and Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. This is by far the darkest Marvel movie in the cinematic universe and the losses that these characters face, are more resonant through Bettany's and Stark's performances. I am not convinced that the screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely who were involved in Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: Civil War and others) gave due justice to Thor: this character has lost so much and I felt more effort should have been spent trying to develop the effect(s) these events have on the character.  Instead, these events are used as vehicles for comedic punchlines, right before a big action sequence. Unfortunate really, given how much potential there is to really flesh out Thor: so much effort is spent trying to humanize the extraterrestrial Titan amongst men, that not enough is spared to humanize the most human (at least physically) among the cast. \n\tNonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. There will be laughs and there will be frowns and a slew of other emotions if you have been following the MCU. This movie does tie these story arcs well, but not without flaws. I will admit that I am so awestruck with how well Thanos is done that I am willing to overlook these flaws.\n\nA solid 4 Rabbits/5.","displayName":"Dmitri K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1600342318/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T20:44:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T20:45:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"870741147","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dmitri K","accountLink":"/user/id/870741147"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"If you rated this movie anything less that 5/5 YOU ARE WRONG!!!!!! - A Die Hard Star Wars Fan","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1928612187150397/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T20:44:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T20:45:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"977240937","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977240937"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"The beginning and middle were extremely good but the ending was awful.
