This movie was great! I don't know any other movie that can do so many crossovers so seamlessly, and at the same time, develop a villain that we can all understand, yet root for the Avengers to beat because he is so misguided. The action in this movie was excellent as expected, and the story flowed very nicely. There was lots of comedy, and we were able to see the transition from the \"broken up Avengers\" to the newly formed Avengers, with an additional, like 10,000 new characters. All jokes aside, this was a great way to round up the MCU in one movie, and any comic book fan should watch this movie.","displayName":"David C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-03T08:07:10.955Z","updateDate":"2019-07-03T08:07:10.955Z","user":{"userId":"978137580","realm":"RT","displayName":"David C","accountLink":"/user/id/978137580"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A perfect way they made Thanos with his goals and the tears at the end!
