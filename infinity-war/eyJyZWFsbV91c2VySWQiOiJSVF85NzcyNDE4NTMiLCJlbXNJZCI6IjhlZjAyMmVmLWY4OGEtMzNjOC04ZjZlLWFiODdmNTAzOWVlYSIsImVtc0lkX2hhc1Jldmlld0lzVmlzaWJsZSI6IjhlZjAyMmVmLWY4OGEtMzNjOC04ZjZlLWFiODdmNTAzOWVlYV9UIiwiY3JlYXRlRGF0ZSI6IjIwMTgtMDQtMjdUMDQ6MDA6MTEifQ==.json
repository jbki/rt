A complex and convoluted villain like Thanos, just strikes so much fear every single moment he makes an appearance on screen, he's basically God and the Devil incarnate. He's a psychotic madman with infinite powers to destroy the universe, but he has his motives and truly believes what he's doing is right which makes him that much more terrifying. The chemistry between the heroes play out fabulously and the pacing is just right, especially in a movie of this scale where we have 5000+ characters. As for the action sequences, it was just flawless visual spectacle that were ripped right out of a comic book. Humor is present and flows according to each group's theme. The children of Thanos were menacing and didn't fail to impress. What made the film stand out the most was that it ended in mystery, a cliffhanger. It makes one wonder, what's going to happen next, what will be the final outcome etc. All in all, Avengers Infinity War is simply outstanding and without a shadow of a doubt one of a kind. 5/5.","displayName":"Brendan A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1831558013731915/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T03:57:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T03:58:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"975082840","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brendan A","accountLink":"/user/id/975082840"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the greatest movies I've ever seen.

I wasn't disappointed. I was slightly expecting more, but I wasn't disappointed.\n\nThis was more of a Thanos film than an Avengers film which was great, because we get to see more of our villain whom we've never seen much of. His motivation was altered from the comics. We never got to see Death, so instead his motivation is to eradicate half of the universe to be able to use more resources on his planet Titan.\n\nThanos' motivation is similar to Ra's Al Ghul from the Batman universe, and The Thinker from The Flash. That's the best kind of villain motivation because in their point of view, they're the heroes. And some of us even root for these villains.\n\nWhat I expected was for the film to have a longer run time. It was 149 minutes and even that is quite short. Yes, SHORT. It had to be 3 hours at least. Because there are so many characters that needed more screen time.\n\nPeople be saying \"The Russos did a good job in balancing the screen time between characters\". But really? Cause all we saw was Thanos, Iron Man, Dr Strange, Thor, and Gamora. Everyone else was in a supporting role or even just cameos. I would have wanted more of Black Panther, White Wolf, Shuri and Captain America. Heroes on the ground were barely on screen.\n\nIf the run time was longer, all of this would be fixed and it would be perfect. Everything else was great, the humour wasn't forced, the visuals were beautiful, the cast chemistry was amazing. But the CGI of Banner's face in the Hulkbuster suit was way off. That shit makes Superman's removed CGI moustache look beautiful.\n\nI found it ridiculous that they gave Bucky a new identity which is White Wolf, just to kill him off, or shall I say, fade away. He may be back, he may not. I don't know. But I surely want to see him again.\n\nPlease don't blame Star Lord. He did the same thing when Ego revealed he killed his mother. No one was complaining then.\n\nFavourite Quote: What master do I serve?
