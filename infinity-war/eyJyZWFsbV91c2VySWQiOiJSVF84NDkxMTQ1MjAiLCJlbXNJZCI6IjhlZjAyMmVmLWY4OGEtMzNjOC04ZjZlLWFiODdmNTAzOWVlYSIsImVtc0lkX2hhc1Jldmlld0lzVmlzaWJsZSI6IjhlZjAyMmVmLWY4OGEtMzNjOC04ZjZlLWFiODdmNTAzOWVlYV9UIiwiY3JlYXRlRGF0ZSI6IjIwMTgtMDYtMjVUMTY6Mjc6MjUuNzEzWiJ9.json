This is no exception.  I can't blame them because there are a ton of characters and several major story lines.  Many things are just glossed over. \n*****spoilers!*****\nWhoever approved the ending should be fired. For anyone that knows about the MCU, it's a dead giveaway for what's going to happen in the next movie. Obviously, all the people that disappeared are in the Soul Stone with Gamorra. They'll show up halfway through the next movie and find a way to get out. A MUCH better ending would have been a cliffhanger  that didn't rely on audience ignorance: just skip over the disappearing. The end would be Thanos snapping and Thor yelling \"What did you just do?\" then Thanos disappears and just the cut of him smiling. The audience would be left asking what happened. The next movie would start and all these people would be gone and we wouldn't know what happened. Just confusion and piecing it together through the movie.","displayName":"Sean H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1129654061/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-24T22:49:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-24T23:05:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"835159737","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sean H","accountLink":"/user/id/835159737"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 24, 2018"}]}
