The movies didn't have a bad plot-line, per say. But they extended the first battle for far too long, then when the final battle came into shot, it was disappointing. Too much buildup for an incredibly disappointing drop, then the credits took far too long for an equally disappointing after-credit film.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/196805674434728/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T15:15:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T15:20:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"977240392","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977240392"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"CONNECTING SO MANY CHARACTERS AFTER TEN YEARS OF MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE MOVIES IN ONE GIGANTIC EVENT IS NO SMALL FEAT.
