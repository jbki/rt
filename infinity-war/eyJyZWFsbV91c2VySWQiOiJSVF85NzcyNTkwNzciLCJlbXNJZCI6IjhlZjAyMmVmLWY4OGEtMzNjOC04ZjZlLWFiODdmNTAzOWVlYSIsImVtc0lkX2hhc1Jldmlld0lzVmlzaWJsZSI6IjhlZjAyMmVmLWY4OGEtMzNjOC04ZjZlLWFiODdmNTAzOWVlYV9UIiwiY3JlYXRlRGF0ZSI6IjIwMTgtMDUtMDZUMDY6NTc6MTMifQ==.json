Without context from the previous movies, it just falls flat. Personally, I have seen most of the previous films, and every time I watched one of them I felt less interested than the last. So in conclusion, Marvel fans will like the film, if you have no context for it and want to see what all the fuss is about, bow to your corporate overlords and watch all the previous films in order to understand what is even going on.","displayName":"Daniel R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T06:38:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T06:55:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"977259095","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel R","accountLink":"/user/id/977259095"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"esse filme foi feito com muito carinho e muito bem pensado. efeitos lindos pequenas falhas mas nao nao a trabalha em nada na historia que ainda nao pode ser dita como boa ou ruim pois o final ainda ira sair, mas ate onde vemos nao ha erros de roteiro piadas bem colocadas e poucas piadas que mostra uma nova formula da marvel mas sem sair da formula por isso amei esse filme(um ep da uma serie de cinema).","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1201843136619013/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T06:28:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T06:34:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"977259091","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977259091"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Sacrifice has never been this meaningless.","displayName":"Egor A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T05:48:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T06:02:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"905604199","realm":"RT","displayName":"Egor A","accountLink":"/user/id/905604199"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Pretty decent, better than that trash film Black Panther. *Disintegrates away*","displayName":"ashley%20 N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T05:43:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T05:46:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"976885361","realm":"RT","displayName":"ashley%20 N","accountLink":"/user/id/976885361"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I want my money back terrible ending movie is ok in parts but drags on and.
