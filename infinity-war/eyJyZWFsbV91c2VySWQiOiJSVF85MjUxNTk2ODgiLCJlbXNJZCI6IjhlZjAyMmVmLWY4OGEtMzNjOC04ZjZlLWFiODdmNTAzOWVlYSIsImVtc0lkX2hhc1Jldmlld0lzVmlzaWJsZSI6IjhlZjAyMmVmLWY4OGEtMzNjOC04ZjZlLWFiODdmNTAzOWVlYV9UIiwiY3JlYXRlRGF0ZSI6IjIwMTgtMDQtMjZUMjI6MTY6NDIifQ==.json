It was the perfect representative of the 10 years and 18 movies that preceded it. It was a love letter, an epic team up, a bold stroke of movie making, and a celebration of all things Marvel. It was a glorious film that did everything that Marvel does right, and an improvement on the things that Marvel has struggled to do. It was funny, it was emotional, it was a well-constructed narrative, it was a small film, it was a huge film, it was a masterpiece. This film was a perfect 10. It was the best Marvel film yet. It was the best superhero film yet.\n\nThe music. The moments. The dialogue. It brought everything you loved about Drax, Spidey, Stark, Star-Lord, Rabbit, and it meshed them all together into the perfect superhero saga. It fixed the flaws with Thor 3. It gave the right characters a moment to shine while holding back on others. It didn't dwell on the major battle scenes, but rather did small heroic feats and sequences here and there to really give the characters the time to breathe.\n\nDid I mention that I loved this film? If you have enjoyed the Marvel films at all, you will love this film. If you appreciate at all what Marvel has done with telling a huge epic story that meshes together (sometimes in a strained way [see Avengers 2], and sometimes in a well blended interwoven dance [see Thor Ragnarok]), you will savor this film. We may never see the likes of Avengers 3 again in terms of sheer ambition and execution of scope.\n\nAnd the ending was as bold a move as any fan of the superhero genre could hope for.","displayName":"Jacob G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T22:16:15.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T22:17:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"787887349","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jacob G","accountLink":"/user/id/787887349"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Fantastic, comedic charater interactions coupled with strong emotional scenes bring this action-packed movie up to 4 star+ status. I am a big fan of Guardians of the Galaxy and I was very pleased that they were 'almost' centre stage in this Marvel Masterpiece. I was disappointed that I didn't get to see Captain Marvel and Ant-Man sadly did not make an appearance but overall this film excited, thrilled and tugged on the heartstrings...can't wait for the next installment.

A true spectacle. Never have I seen a film before where the whole audience goes from hysterical laughter to a tense silence in seconds. If you have loved the marvel journey upto now this is the payoff you have been waiting for, if you haven't you will have no clue what the hell is going on. The film almost has a Game of Thrones vibe jumping from group of characters to group of characters until the finale. Thanos is truly a fantastic villain and this is his story. I can't wait to see it again.","displayName":"Jack D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1645006476/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T22:10:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T22:14:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"848510249","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jack D","accountLink":"/user/id/848510249"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was insane!!!!
