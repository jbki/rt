As any Ensemble movie should be.\nInfinity war is an excellent movie. The heroes are built upon wonderfully and are each given excellent character building moments. But the real star of this film is Thanos.\nThis film builds up the mad Titan as a universal threat. You can make the argument that this is a Thanos movie more than anything else. Josh Brolin delivers a deliciously imposing performance, competing with Michael B Jordan for best MCU villain.\nIt's an excellent blockbuster. The perfect avengers movie that sets up the grand finale in the best possible way.","displayName":"Insta.
