Avengers Infinity War broke my heart. It was such a dark film, and Marvel's most ambitious yet. Nonetheless, under the able direction of the Russo brothers and of course, it was a thrilling and emotional ride. And Marvel has a knack for creating multifaceted villains - Josh Brolin as Thanos was so good. An excellent production of distinction and ambition - very well done, though I could be grumbling that it's only a part one, and so many questions left to be answered. Looking forward to the grand finale.","displayName":"Chrisanne C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-27T02:16:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-27T02:38:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"909989370","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chrisanne C","accountLink":"/user/id/909989370"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"IW was way too hyped and it was difficult to live up to it. MCU shot itself in the foot by building too much \"culmination of 10 years\" and failed miserably to deliver.
