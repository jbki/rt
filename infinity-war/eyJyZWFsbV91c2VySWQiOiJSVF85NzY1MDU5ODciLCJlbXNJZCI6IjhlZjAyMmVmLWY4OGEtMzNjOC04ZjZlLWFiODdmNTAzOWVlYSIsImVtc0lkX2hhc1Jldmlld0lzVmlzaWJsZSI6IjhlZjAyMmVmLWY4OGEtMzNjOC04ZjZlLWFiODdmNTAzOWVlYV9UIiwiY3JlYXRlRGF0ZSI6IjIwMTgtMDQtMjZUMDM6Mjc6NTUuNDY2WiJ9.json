Really good movie, did not disappoint. I love how the “good guys” don’t win this one, I think the Marvel universe needed some of that.

As a fan for 10 years of the MCU this film gives you everything you want and more. Yes it's non stop, but it's a great way of humanising what happens. Life doesn't give you short breaks so you can absorb it. And that's a great way of showing you that the characters need to deal with the biggest threat ever seen so far.\n\nThe build for this film is totally justified and will drag you in to happy, sad, heart wrenching moments and literal one after the other. I laughed so much and was also brought to a tear and it's all because of how marvel has made you love and care for the characters. \n\nThis film is huge. HUGE. It's the next day and I can not stop thinking about it. My only wish is that they released this and avengers 4 within a month of each other because this wait is going to be a tough one. \n\n10/10 from an MCU fan and just flat out enjoys what marvel do.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10213534197084168/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T03:14:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T03:24:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"977239346","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977239346"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I've seen all the films leading up to this and this one didn't disappoint.
