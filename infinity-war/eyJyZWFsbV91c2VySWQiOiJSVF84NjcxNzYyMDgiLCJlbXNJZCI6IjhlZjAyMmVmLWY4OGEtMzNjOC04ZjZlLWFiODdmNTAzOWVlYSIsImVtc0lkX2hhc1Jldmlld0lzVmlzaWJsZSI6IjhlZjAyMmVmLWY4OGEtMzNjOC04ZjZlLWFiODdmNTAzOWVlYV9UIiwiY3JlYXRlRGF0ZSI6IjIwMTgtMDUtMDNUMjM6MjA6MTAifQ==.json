This long ass 2.5 hours movie is divided into 3 different stories kind of like what they did with some of the Star Wars movies. \nThe first scenes are with Ironman, Spiderman, and Dr. Strange with some of the Guardians joining in late. \nThe second scenes are with Thor and some Guardians trying to get back the hammer. And the final scenes are with the rest of the Avengers including Captain America with no star shield, Black Willow, vision, Black Panther, and those flying guys with no arrow Hawkeye guy. Where did he go? Each got a fair amount of screen time which I think was good. I liked the action scenes and the battle against the Thanos but I think he was too overpowered. There was one part where they could have killed him but they messed up and let him take them down easily. I also didn't like the talking scenes with the Guardian girl and Thanos. Even though it was touching, it didn't really need to be there. Same goes with Thor and the Guardians talking. There were 3 of them and those scenes really needed to be cut. The finale on Wakanda against Thanos's army and his soldiers was the best part but the ending leaves you hanging on a big cliffhanger so I guess we will have to find out what happens next. This didn't feel too long but they could have cut it down to 2 hours. Overall it was probably just as good as Age of Ultron except that movie has a better finale.","displayName":"Adrien B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1293642169/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T21:56:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-13T23:38:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"891899909","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adrien B","accountLink":"/user/id/891899909"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR. What I liked most about Avengers: Infinity War was the moral ambiguity. It is a variation of the lifeboat story: In an over crowded life boat becoming swamped, do you throw some people overboard in order to save the others, or does everyone drown together? Most reviews I have seen ignore this central plot of the film and instead focus on the characters (including which live and which die), roller-coaster action, computer graphics, etc. . \n\nThanos, the putative villain, is the one with his eye on the real problem facing sentient beings throughout the universe. Thanos is the only one who seems to see that the problem is rampant suicidal greed and exploitation of the environment of every planet that sentience beings occupy, or at least he is the only one who acknowledges that something must be done about it sooner rather than later. Yes, his final solution is terrible and drastic, but who else is offering any kind of solution? In the absence of any other actual solutions, the purely logical solution of culling the herds to manageable sustainable size makes rational sense. And Thanos knows that such decisions are usually made by the political elites who control the planets (as in the classic film Soylent Green), so Thanos enforces the only fair process of strict random selection for which half lives and which is culled. \n\nOn the other hand, the one not wearing the Infinity Glove, the so-called heroes, the Avengers, don't have any solution, if they even see or acknowledge the problem. The Avengers are the enforcers of planetary capitalism and protectors of the status quo of the elite's greed creating climate change, ecological disaster, and species destruction. Instead of addressing and answering the question that Thanos is asking, by offering an alternative strategy, the Avengers just assert Thanos is wrong and fight back to stop him. \n\nThis is a delicious plot twist wherein the Avengers and Thanos are playing on a morally level playing field with each having good and bad arguments in their favor or against them. \n\nWith so many killed by the end of the film, we expect some kind of time twist to undo what has been done, and that leaves the cryptic teaser at the end where we are wondering who Fury's SOS signal went to? \n\nBut also, we are left wondering if the Avengers will even understand that Thanos has as least crafted \"a\" solution to suicidal extinction by his forced sustainability through population reduction. Because isn't that the argument made by capitalism, which claims that any force or argument for sustainability is inherently evil because it prevents the \"freedom' of capitalists to exploit and extract as many natural resources as they can before irredeemably fouling the nest of our spaceship earth? As Michelle West reminded us at the White House Correspondent's Dinner, Flint still does not have clean water! And the oil pipelines are already spilling. .\n\nThe writers of he Avengers have written themselves into a most difficult dilemma. What better solution to the problem of sustainability than that created by Thanos can the Avengers offer? If the Avengers merely restore the status quo ante supporting rapacious capitalism, then the series will have been a tremendous exercise in futility, and Thanos will be proven to have been the real hero.","displayName":"Gregory W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T21:36:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T21:37:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"900986367","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gregory W","accountLink":"/user/id/900986367"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Although possibly confusing for non-followers of the mcu, Infinity War offers an exciting 2.5 hour experience with lots of action, an enjoyable plot, and even some comedy.\nIt's worth noting that the emotion in the film can be felt by both non-followers, and passionate fans, although more intense for the latter.","displayName":"Marcus J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T21:11:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T21:40:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"977255817","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marcus J","accountLink":"/user/id/977255817"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fantastic well written action adventure","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1669621323087384/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T21:06:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T21:07:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"977255815","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977255815"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"As a standalone movie, they did incredible.  To give that many larger than life characters all a moment to shine is incredible piece work in writing.  The effects are insane, and IMAX 3D is one hell of an experience.
