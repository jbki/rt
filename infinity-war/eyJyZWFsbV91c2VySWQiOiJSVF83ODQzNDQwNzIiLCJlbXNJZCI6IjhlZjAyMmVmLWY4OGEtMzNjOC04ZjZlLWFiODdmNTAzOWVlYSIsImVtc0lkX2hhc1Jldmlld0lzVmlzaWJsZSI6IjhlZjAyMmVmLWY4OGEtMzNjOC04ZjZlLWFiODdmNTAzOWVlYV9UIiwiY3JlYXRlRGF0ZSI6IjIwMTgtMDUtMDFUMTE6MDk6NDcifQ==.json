But it made me understand the depth of the film and much more appreciate it. Incredible action, dialogue characters. Thanos is really beautiful in his cruelty and \"I bear justice\" - the idea. Separate admiration for the soundtracks, they just catch their breath. The finale is simply incredible. I'll definitely check it again.

This movie isn't your average comic book movie, nor is it your average movie. This is more of an event than a film. Even though this is a crossover with already realized characters, it still does a good job developing some of them. Thanos is a truly exceptional villain and Josh Brolin's performance was outstanding. The CGI on the character was top notch and he felt as real as the people that were on set. The action was excellent and a pleasure to watch.

Now the bad - clearly Marvel's attempt at releasing the \"Empire Strikes Back\" of their franchise. The problem there - SUPER HERO movies where darn near everyone DIES just SUCK. I THANK GOD I didn't take my little ones to see this because I felt like I needed anti-depressants after watching the entire credits and realizing that yes, the movie was really over.  I wanted to watch Empire again but this one, not so much and why?  Because either (1) I wasted almost 3 hrs and $ on this movie and to bring back all the important cast the next movie will simply use the time-stone to in effect \"erase\" this movie OR (2) Marvel just killed off literally half of their stars and the next movies won't be worth watching.  Either scenario do you notice that Marvel walks away with $ and a bunch of my time to watch in effect, smoke and mirrors tantamount to the final finale of LOST?
