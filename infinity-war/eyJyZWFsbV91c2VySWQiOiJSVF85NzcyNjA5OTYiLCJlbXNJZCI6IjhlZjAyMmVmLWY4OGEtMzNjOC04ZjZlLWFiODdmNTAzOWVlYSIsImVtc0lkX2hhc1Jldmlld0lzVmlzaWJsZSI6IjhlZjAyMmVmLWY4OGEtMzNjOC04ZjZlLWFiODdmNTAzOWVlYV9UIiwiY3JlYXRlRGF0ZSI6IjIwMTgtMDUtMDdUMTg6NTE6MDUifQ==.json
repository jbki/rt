There are a couple of plot holes, but there's so much going on that you don't have time to think about them while watching the movie.  It's only afterwards that they start to appear.  This movie is obviously a setup to Avengers 4, so that takes a little away from the ending.  Overall a very entertaining movie with non-stop action that keeps you glued to your seat.  I can hardly wait for Avengers 4 - I expect it will be an even better movie than AIW.","displayName":"R C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T18:32:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T18:38:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"977212323","realm":"RT","displayName":"R C","accountLink":"/user/id/977212323"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"This film was the worst thing to happen to superhero movies since Batman vs. Superman. With obvious plotholes that undermine the fundamental premise of the film, a completely unsympathetic villain who's given way too much screentime, mind-numbing action completely unaware of the concepts of scale and balance, and an ending so insulting to fans it's amazing it made it out of the first draft, this movie is sure to upset and confuse viewers of all ages. While the actors give overall very charismatic performances, any redeeming qualities their comedy brings is completely outweighed by each hero's individual, and collectively dumb decision to consistently not save the universe that any redeeming qualities of this film are rendered null.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10212004923345848/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T18:23:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T18:28:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"977260971","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977260971"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"fun action packed movie but wired ending.
