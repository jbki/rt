Ten years of movies have been building up to this moment. After ten years of offering some really solid entertainment, Marvel Studios produces a film that, while colorful and filled with some of the most fun moments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is also one of the darkest, most heartbreaking and most haunting Hollywood blockbusters ever made. Balancing different tones was never hard for the Russo Brothers, but with \"Avengers: Infinity War\" they also proved that it's not hard for them to bring together an insane amount of heroes for one big team up and somehow give them all their moments to shine. The character interactions are in fact, part of both some of the funniest and some of the saddest scenes in this cinematic epic. The least you know about this film the better, since it's one big, shocking surprise overall. This is very much Thanos' film, as he easily has the most screen time and we go on a journey with him in his attempt to get these powerful gems, called the infinity stones, to accomplish his goals. Probably the most terrifying and the best written villain ever in a comic book movie and maybe even in film history as a whole, Josh Brolin gives a motion capture performance that's worth all the praise that it has got and even more. The visual effects are breathtaking, the soundtrack perfectly captures the dark tone of the film, the action is more impressive than it has ever been, the tension is here, the stakes, the consequences. Everything a person can ask from this movie, it delivers. It feels like Marvel, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones all had a baby. The ending is as haunting as that of a horror movie. By far the most intense cinematic experience I've ever had in my entire life. \"Infinity War\" is the best superhero, the best supervillain and overall, one of the best films in history.","displayName":"Dan E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-12T03:47:02.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-19T02:50:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"977265410","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dan E","accountLink":"/user/id/977265410"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Sucked.

I honestly don’t know why people were so shaken by the ending... like OBVIOUSLY that’s not how it all ends, there’s no way that Marvel/Disney would kill off that many characters in one go permanently. Way too much money left to be milked from this cash cow franchise. That being said, Thor definitely stole the show and saved this movie for me. Chris Hemsworth was fantastic. I never really cared for Thor until this movie, now he’s for sure a favorite.
