While not a perfect film, I don't think it could have been much better. With so many characters involved, it is so refreshing to see an action feature give each character their justified development. Other studios should take notice. Clearly, Marvel Studios understands what viewers want and what it takes to elevate a film franchise.","displayName":"Nate G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-09T10:23:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-09T10:27:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"964864905","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nate G","accountLink":"/user/id/964864905"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Honestly one of the best movies I've ever seen.. and I've seen a lot.

After seeing it, I felt like I went to a 4 star restarant for dinner.. I had an awesome appetizer, a great entree, and stewed prunes with whipped cream for dessert. The end of the movie killed all the fun and enjoyment of the rest of it.  A few things that happened at the end just don't make sense.  I can only hope that the next installment will explain a lot of what happened and they don't use some cheesy gimmick to fix what happened.","displayName":"Chuck S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1152128732/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-09T09:59:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-09T10:02:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"852023207","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chuck S","accountLink":"/user/id/852023207"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome addition to the series!","displayName":"Mark S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-09T09:50:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-09T09:51:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"975827851","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark S","accountLink":"/user/id/975827851"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"wow. that was something.. :) like watching multiple movies lol","displayName":"Scott W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/561735750/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-09T09:47:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-10T12:12:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"782613092","realm":"RT","displayName":"Scott W","accountLink":"/user/id/782613092"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 09, 2018"}]}
