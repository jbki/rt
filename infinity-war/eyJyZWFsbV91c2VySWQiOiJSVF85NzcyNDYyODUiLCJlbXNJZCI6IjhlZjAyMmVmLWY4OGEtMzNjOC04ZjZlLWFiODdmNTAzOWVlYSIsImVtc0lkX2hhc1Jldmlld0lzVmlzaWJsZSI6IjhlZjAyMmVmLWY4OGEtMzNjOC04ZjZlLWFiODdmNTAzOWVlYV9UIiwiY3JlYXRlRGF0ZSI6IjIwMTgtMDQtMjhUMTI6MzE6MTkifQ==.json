If you’re not a Marvel movie fan, your appreciation is likely to be lower than mine. It’s massive, as a movie about saving half the universe should be. It’s not perfect, but it’s fun, exciting, and suspenseful right up until it’s gut-wrenching sad. Unfortunately, those who haven’t seen all the movies and loved all of these characters won’t just miss jokes or little Easter eggs. They’ll miss the gravity and painful sadness of some of these moments. Nevertheless, there’s enough there to still be worth seeing.
