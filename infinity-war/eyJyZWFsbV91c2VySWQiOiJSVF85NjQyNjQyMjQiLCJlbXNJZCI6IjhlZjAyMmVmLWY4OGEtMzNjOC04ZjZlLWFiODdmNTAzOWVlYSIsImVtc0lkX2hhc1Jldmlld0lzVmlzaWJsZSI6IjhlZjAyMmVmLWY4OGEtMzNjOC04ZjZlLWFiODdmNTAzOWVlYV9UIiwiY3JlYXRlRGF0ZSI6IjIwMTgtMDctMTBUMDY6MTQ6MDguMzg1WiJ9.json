The movie proves that a story of multiple and unavoidable characters can be told and visualized in mere 160 Minutes. KUDOS!!!\nThe balance of characters and events are done with great precision and timing.\nSadly, I never get to see HULK in his SMASH mode. Hope the next/Final part will have hulk in full SMASH mode kicking Thanos!!!","displayName":"John T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-09T23:15:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-09T23:29:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"977353074","realm":"RT","displayName":"John T","accountLink":"/user/id/977353074"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Everything I could have hoped for in a comic book movie 15 years in the making.","displayName":"David C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/507616411/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-09T18:48:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-09T18:49:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"793501112","realm":"RT","displayName":"David C","accountLink":"/user/id/793501112"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"the biggest draw of this film was that it had almost the entire MCU cast in one film, however that just emphasizes the fact that the vast majority of the cast are mostly, if not entirely, meaningless to the plot of the film \n\nthe plot itself leads you to believe this is a Guardians of the Galaxy film, yet the film includes all these other characters just to make them pawns and turn them into shock value when certain events happen","displayName":"Lupe N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-09T16:23:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-09T16:25:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"976847282","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lupe N","accountLink":"/user/id/976847282"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A little confusing towards the end, and you’ll see why.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-09T14:56:11.878Z","updateDate":"2018-07-09T14:56:11.878Z","user":{"userId":"963299018","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/963299018"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"very enjoyable kinda a lot movie of the decade","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-09T14:49:53.091Z","updateDate":"2018-07-09T14:49:53.091Z","user":{"userId":"952128170","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/952128170"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I've never seen something like that before!
