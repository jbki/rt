And epic is the perfect word to describe it.\nThis movie juggles these characters with surprising ease. It involves several stories involving groups of these characters, which eventually converge into the final battle. Despite this structure, the movie never feels crowded, which may have been helped by its long run-time.\nThe rest of the movie is an amazing spectacle. It's funny at times, but it also gets into some dark drama, which we'll get into later.\nThe villain, Thanos, (played by Josh Brolin) is a surprisingly sympathetic character. Despite his undeniably evil goal of destroying half of the universe, he is doing it to solve overpopulation, and you get the idea that he honestly believes that he is doing the right thing. There are also several moments where he shows that he has emotions. While his character is not as strong as the villain in Black Panther earlier this year, he is still a lot more memorable than in most other superhero movies.\nAnd now I guess it's time to get to the elephant in the room with this movie. This is intended to be only part one of a two part Avengers story, and it ends on a cliffhanger. Except it doesn't exactly feel like a cliffhanger. There is no indication that there will be some kind of resolution to what happens at the end. It's the exact definition of a downer ending.\nNot all of the characters make it out alive. Sure there are a lot of deaths that they will probably find some way to undo. But then there are others before the ending that will probably be more permanent. Either way, not everybody in the theater was prepared for it, and if you have kids who want to see it, make sure that they understand that there will be more movies. Because this is a depressing movie, but that's part of what makes it feel so different.\n\njaythemovieguy.blogspot.com","displayName":"Jay S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T13:10:00.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T13:10:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"966350117","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jay S","accountLink":"/user/id/966350117"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was pretty amazing what Marvel did here.
