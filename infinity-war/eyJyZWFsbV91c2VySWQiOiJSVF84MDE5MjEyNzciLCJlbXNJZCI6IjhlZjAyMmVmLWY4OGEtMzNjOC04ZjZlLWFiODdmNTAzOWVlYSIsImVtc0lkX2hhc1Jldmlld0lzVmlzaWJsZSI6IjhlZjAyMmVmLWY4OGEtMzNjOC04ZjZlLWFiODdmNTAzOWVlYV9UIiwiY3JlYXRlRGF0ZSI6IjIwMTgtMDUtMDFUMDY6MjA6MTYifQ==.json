This is of course because it is just part 1 of a 2 part story. Having followed comic books for a for a couple years and being a fan of superhero cartoons, this is just par for the course. The more epic the storyline the darker and more hopeless the story gets before it is resolved. So understand and can appreciate the story telling, however my friends who have not followed comics and aren't into cartoons felt very unhappy at the end of the movie. Clocking in around 2 1/2 hours, you don't feel rewarded for sticking it.  Some of the fight sequences are just too long and worse than that the camera is all over the place and cutting from shot to shot, you can't actually tell what's going on or even whose winning the fights. Did they have amazing choreography or did the just jump the camera around to make everything look fast??? I don't know.  \n\nOn the positive side, Thanos was awesome! His fight sequences were great and really showed off the Titan he is. The writing for him was different than I expected, really humanizing him so you kinda want him to succeed.\n\nThe mashup of the Marvel heroes was great and their chemistry for the most part worked pretty well.  The only problem was the interruption of any serious or emotional moment with a jag or joke.  Some where appreciated and others were just like, \"huh another joke. It got to where anytime a moment got serious and the emotional music was flowing, you could start counting down 3..2..1...joke.","displayName":"Heath V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T06:11:14.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T06:30:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"969058531","realm":"RT","displayName":"Heath V","accountLink":"/user/id/969058531"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Boring and awful.

The last Thor movie the hero lost and now you have 12 hero's and they can't beat one guy??  Just a big waste of time.  I don't care what their plans are for future movies, I don't wasted 2 and a half hours to watch a depressing superhero movie.  I won't go see another.","displayName":"joseph e","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T05:49:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T05:51:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"976367008","realm":"RT","displayName":"joseph e","accountLink":"/user/id/976367008"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I was completely blown away after watching this movie.
