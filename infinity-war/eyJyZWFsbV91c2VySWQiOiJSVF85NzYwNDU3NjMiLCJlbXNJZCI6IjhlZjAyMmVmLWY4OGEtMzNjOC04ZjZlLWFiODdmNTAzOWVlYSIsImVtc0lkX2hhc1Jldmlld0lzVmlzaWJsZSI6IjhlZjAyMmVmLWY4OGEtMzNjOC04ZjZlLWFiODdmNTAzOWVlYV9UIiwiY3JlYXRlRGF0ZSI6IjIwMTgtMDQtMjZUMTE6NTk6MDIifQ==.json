Just, wow!! Marvel Cinematic Universe has been building up to this movie for ten years. This movie is glorious. All I can say is, you will not be expecting what happens. It left me screaming inside. I still cannot believe it.\n\nThe storyline is about the Avengers and their allies needing to team up to stop the titan Thanos from collecting The Infinity Stones and destroying half the universe. \n\nNow, because all the Marvel characters are finally coming together, Marvel fans will obviously be excited. And when basically every single character appears on-screen, the theater erupts into claps and screams of joy. I always love it when a studio or company can make people feel such excitement for their characters. It's just really cool. \n\nThis movie features lots of different locations that the characters travel to. I must admit, some of these locations are absolutely gorgeous and others, totally desolate, but still incredible. I love the shots in space and on different planets, especially the snowy planet that Thanos goes to at one point. In fact, the whole movie looks fantastic. Everything - from the costumes, the camera angles, the scale, the special effects -  everything! I was so invested in the visuals the entire time. \n\nAlso, let's be honest, this is Marvel, we all expect this movie to be absolutely hilarious. And it is. No surprises there. I laughed so hard at Iron Man and Doctor Strange arguing, Star Lord being jealous of Thor and basically all of Spider Man and Drax's dialogue. Comedy always seems to be Marvel's greatest strength. The writing, in general, is fantastic. I love the interactions these characters have, even the dramatic moments. That's coming from someone who usually hates dramatic moments, because I hate being sad in movies. \n\nThis is a superhero movie, so obviously there are some pretty cool action scenes. And yeah, this movie has some awesome action scenes. Probably my favorite is the huge fight in Wakanda that is shown in the trailer. The fight is absolutely massive and straight up amazing. The shots and the way the characters work together are just glorious. I felt so immersed in all the action.\n\nSince this movie is connected to the other Marvel movies in their Cinematic Universe, there is the possible question about whether you need to have seen all the other movies in order to understand this one. I would say, not all of them, but at least a few certain ones. I recommend that you brush up on your Marvel characters before you go, just to be ready.\n\nI give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, as it gets pretty dark.","displayName":"Ranny L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/540643665/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T11:06:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-01T11:46:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"850302412","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ranny L","accountLink":"/user/id/850302412"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is the greatest movie ever made!!!!!!!","displayName":"Nathan%20 T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T10:57:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-14T14:08:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"977084506","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nathan%20 T","accountLink":"/user/id/977084506"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Saw the movie on opening midnight and glad I did.

It is a summer blockbuster and well worth the money for the big screen experience.  \nAll of the characters feel like the characters not watered-down version of themselves to make the movie. What I mean is that when you get to Wakanda you feel like you are entering the world of Wakanda not just a set piece of it. The characters of Wakanda still come across as they did in Black Panther. The best example would be a line from Okoye talking to Black Panther while walking up to an incoming ship. She makes on handed comment about the Olympics and Starbucks. The Guardians of the Galaxy all feel like they did in their own movies even the music used for them and the chemistry of the character's was still there.  The best compliment I can give the movie is that it felt true all most all of the characters regardless of how large or small their part was.","displayName":"Allen D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T10:27:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T14:51:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"901207126","realm":"RT","displayName":"Allen D","accountLink":"/user/id/901207126"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"}]}
