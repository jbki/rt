Thanos is simply amazing and the best MCU villain yet. You actually understand his motive and the logic in it, something vital in a good villain. This is THANOS movie, and he's the best part of it. All the Avengers casting, what else can I say about them? They were all amazing and their characters developed even more. This movie has it all, great fight scenes, amazing villain and heroes, drama, comedy, sadness, you get the point. Just watch it. Although do watch all previous MCU movies since you won't understand s**t if you don't. I'm so excited in what direction part 2 will go and I hope Marvel keeps doing this (changing formula and having good villains). 9.5/10, amazing","displayName":"Fernando S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T00:34:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T00:40:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"977251968","realm":"RT","displayName":"Fernando S","accountLink":"/user/id/977251968"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"So many emotions gone through.
