Anthony and Joe Russo put together what is in my opinion the second best Avengers movie with strong performances, especially from RDJ, Brolin, Hemsworth, Evans, Ruffalo, Holland, Cumberbatch,Olsen, Boseman, Pratt, Saldana, Bautista,Cooper, Diesel, Klementieff, Dinklage and Bettany! Am exceptional and exciting score from all time great Alan Silvestri proves to be a classic and the return of the Avengers theme that was lost in action for most of Age of Ultron is welcomed very much and exciting cinematography from Trent Opaloch! Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt's editing skills again prove strong to the construction of the storyline! The visual effects help complete an exciting and exceptional story that was written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely!","displayName":"Cody M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-06-17T16:30:01.119Z","updateDate":"2019-07-26T16:42:40.015Z","user":{"userId":"978113916","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cody M","accountLink":"/user/id/978113916"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of my favourite MCU movi","displayName":"Sully L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10158543052660744/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-06-15T13:58:52.050Z","updateDate":"2019-06-15T13:58:52.096Z","user":{"userId":"978111798","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sully L","accountLink":"/user/id/978111798"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I.

I had very high expectations. I had unrealistically high expectations.\nThis is the only film in my recent memory that not only met my expectations but exceeded them by a long shot. Superhero genre will never be the same after this.\nI loved the heroes, I loved the villain. In fact, I loved the villain more than the heroes themselves.\nI have never seen a more layered villain than Thanos. I was on board with his plan and I would be lying if I was not happy when he won. The Avengers I think lost for the first time and it was great. I wanted Thanos to win because of his noble intentions.\nOverpopulation has troubled our planet for a long time and if it's not controlled will lead to our doom.\nThe message, the acting, the writing, and above all the visuals are all fantastic. My utmost respect to the Russo Brothers and everyone at Marvel Studios for this massive undertaking.\nPerfectly balanced. As all things should be.","displayName":"Nandan T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1293975327340009/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-06-13T07:35:22.212Z","updateDate":"2019-06-13T07:35:22.212Z","user":{"userId":"975899477","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nandan T","accountLink":"/user/id/975899477"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Honestly, it shouldn't be able to live up to the hype, but by god it does. I'm every conceivable way. It might all be best summed up in the scene when Thanos actually arrives. After what, 20 films? And he's been the mastermind behind the whole thing? The overarching threat across the whole series should NOT have been able to live up to the hype. But he did. He absolutely did. The whole film goes by so easily I didn't even notice it was as long as it is (it's just under 2m5 hours), and it manages to keep you engaged the entire way through. The story threads from all the film's, and the vast ensemble of characters, are somehow very capably handled. No-one seems really left out. Everyone gets a part. It's basically my dream since I was a young child out on screen.
