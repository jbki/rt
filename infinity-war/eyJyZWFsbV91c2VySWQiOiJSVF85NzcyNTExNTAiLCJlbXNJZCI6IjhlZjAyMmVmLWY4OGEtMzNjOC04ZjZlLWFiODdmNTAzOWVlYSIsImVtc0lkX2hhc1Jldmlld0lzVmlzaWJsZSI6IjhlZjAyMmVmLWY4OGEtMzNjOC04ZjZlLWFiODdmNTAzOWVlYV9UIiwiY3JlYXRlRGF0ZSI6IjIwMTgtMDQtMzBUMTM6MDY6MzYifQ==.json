Producers for years have taken unsuccessful comic book franchises and mashed up successful heros next to them to brainwash the public into buying tickets for less successful franchises. Captain America was the least popular comic... but how do we make people buy a ticket for something they don’t like?.. Just put captain America with his buddy spider man, and iron man and people will buy a ticket. Most of you watching don’t even realize these notions when you buy a ticket. I miss when movies did something individualistic and creative every time. Those days are LONG gone. I REFUSE to give marvel a penny to make another movie.

It is so rich, so dense, that the film focuses on the villain as the main character, yet none of the heroes feel short changed. Their stories have a deep resonance that is unexpected in the genre.\n\nIf, as is my opinion, \"The Dark Knight\" is the best superhero film, then \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is the best comic book film.","displayName":"Todd H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T12:51:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T12:54:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"925798362","realm":"RT","displayName":"Todd H","accountLink":"/user/id/925798362"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The most boring movie I have ever seen in years.
