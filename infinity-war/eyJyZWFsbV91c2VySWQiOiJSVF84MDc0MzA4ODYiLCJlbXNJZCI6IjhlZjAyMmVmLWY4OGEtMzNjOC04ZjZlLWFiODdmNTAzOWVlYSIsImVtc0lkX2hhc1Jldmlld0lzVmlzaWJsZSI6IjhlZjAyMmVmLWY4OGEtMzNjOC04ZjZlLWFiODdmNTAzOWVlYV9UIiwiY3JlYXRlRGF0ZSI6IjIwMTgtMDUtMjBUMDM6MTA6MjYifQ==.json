No doubt there are some, but they pale in comparison to how entertained I felt through the entire film.  It is quite long, but it didn't seem it.\nThe sheer number of heroes on show and how well their characters were maintained, transitioning between scenes all over the galaxy, was very well executed.  Every established character could have been in their own independent movie, yet they all worked in this one story more than enough for my satisfaction.\nI can't rate it highly enough and there have been precious few films that have warranted a second viewing from me... bring on the next chapter.","displayName":"Alex G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-20T00:44:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-20T00:54:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"977278059","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex G","accountLink":"/user/id/977278059"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 20, 2018"}]}
