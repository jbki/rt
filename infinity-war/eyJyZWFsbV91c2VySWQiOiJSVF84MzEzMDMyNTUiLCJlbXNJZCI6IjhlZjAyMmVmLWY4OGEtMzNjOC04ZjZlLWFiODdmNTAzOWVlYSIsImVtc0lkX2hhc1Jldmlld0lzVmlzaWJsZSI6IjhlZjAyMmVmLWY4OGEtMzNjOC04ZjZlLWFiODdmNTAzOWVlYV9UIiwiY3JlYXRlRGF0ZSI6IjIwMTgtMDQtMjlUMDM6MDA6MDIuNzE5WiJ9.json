A lot of people are saying it was cheap with deaths, and that they went too hard for anyone to believe it will stick, but you have to remember it is a comic book movie- comic books kill and rez main characters all the time, so theres really no better way for them to have done it. I still teared up at the climax as the body count rapidly racked up from the event which I wont spoil- nobody should read these before seeing the movie but hey, some are dumb. In my mind, it blended the dark and serious with the comical slapstick, the Avengers and the Guardian's two very different styles, into a good, middle ground that tied the two teams together wonderfully.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/428109987601328/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T02:36:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T02:40:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247817","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977247817"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Perfect!
