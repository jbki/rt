Prior to and during the viewing of this film, I can't shake this feeling that this whole movie simply revolves around the Thanos snap. And everything has to fall in line no matter how irrational or illogical it may sound in retrospect. So for no apparent reason, bruce banner suddenly can't turn into hulk. And for no apparent reason, Doctor Strange suddenly forgot that he could just rewind time when Thanos has the upper hand.\n\nI dunno. Maybe I didn't read the original comics or story because it's way before my time. Maybe all of it makes perfect sense in the original script. But it certainly didn't make any sense in the movie. All of it seems like all set in motion to create this clash between the heroes and the god-like Thanos. At the cost of sensibility. And stripped of the thrill of that final clash, since the movie is clearly building up to the snap, this movie is nothing but a lot of flares and grunting. Pardon my language, I think I could say the same for some pornography, but at least there'd be some action in it.","displayName":"Michael C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/551543723/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-07-26T05:18:19.961Z","updateDate":"2019-07-26T05:18:19.961Z","user":{"userId":"894905340","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael C","accountLink":"/user/id/894905340"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It is necessary for us in Western culture to develop the cultural language of defeat and hopelessness.
