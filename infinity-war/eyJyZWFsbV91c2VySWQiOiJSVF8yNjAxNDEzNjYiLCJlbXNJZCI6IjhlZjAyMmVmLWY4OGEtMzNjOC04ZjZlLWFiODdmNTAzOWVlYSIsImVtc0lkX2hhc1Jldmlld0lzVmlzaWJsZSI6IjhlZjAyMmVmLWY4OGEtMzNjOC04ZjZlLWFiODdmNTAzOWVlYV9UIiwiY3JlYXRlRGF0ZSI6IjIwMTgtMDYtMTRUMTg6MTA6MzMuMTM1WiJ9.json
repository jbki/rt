Another great Marvel film. Its so great watching all the heros meet up and jockey for alpha position, and because there coming from there own movies you don't lose too much time with back stories. love the way they gave Thanos a believable reason to have his evil quest.","displayName":"Michelle L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-14T02:35:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-14T02:43:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"977318797","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michelle L","accountLink":"/user/id/977318797"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 14, 2018"}]}
