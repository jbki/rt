The pacing of the movie was absolutely incredible. Even with so many characters and so much action set pieces the movie didn't felt bloated one bit.

Dois pontos para ressaltar que não apreciei foram alguns momentos que tentaram encaixar algumas piadas mas ao meu ver não agregaram em nada e não achei muito convincente a motivação do vilão. Mas saí do cinema feliz com o conjunto da obra.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2025797181018479/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-04T09:10:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-04T09:15:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"977256350","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977256350"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"so awesome, so very awesome..","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-04T09:09:44.396Z","updateDate":"2018-05-04T09:09:44.396Z","user":{"userId":"905379492","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/905379492"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Epic movie. Everything I could have ever want and more in the movie that all of the MCU films in the past 10 years have been leading up to. Every single scene either gave me chills, put me on the edge of tears, or made me want to jump out of my seat in excitement. There are a few plotholes, but overall I think the directors did a great job of putting dozens of characters together to form an intense, yet emotional superhero movie. Probs gonna watch it again and I would definitely recommend anyone to go see it.","displayName":"Anonymous D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-04T09:08:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-04T09:17:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"977256348","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anonymous D","accountLink":"/user/id/977256348"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was jaw-dropping from the first minute to the insane end.

It's my favorite so far in the MCU, with incredible dramatic moments, characters, fight scenes, and surprises. It far surpasses Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron.
