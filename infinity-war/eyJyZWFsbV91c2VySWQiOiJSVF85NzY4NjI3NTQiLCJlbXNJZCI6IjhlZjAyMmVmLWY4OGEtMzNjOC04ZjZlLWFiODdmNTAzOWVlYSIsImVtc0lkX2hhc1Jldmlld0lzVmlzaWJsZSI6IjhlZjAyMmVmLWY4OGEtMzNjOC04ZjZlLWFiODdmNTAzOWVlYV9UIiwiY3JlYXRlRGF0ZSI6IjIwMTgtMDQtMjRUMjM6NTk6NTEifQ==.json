Really sad a few times. Quite a few jaw dropping moments. A lot of goosebumps and chills. Fewer people died than i expected. Thanos is an amazing villain, sympathetic in some scenes, throughout the whole movie i wanted thanos to lose and i had hope they would stop him, but the turnout is unexpected and sad. The post credits scene created a few questions and i loved the massive hint.","displayName":"Darth%20 S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T23:51:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T07:44:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"977236847","realm":"RT","displayName":"Darth%20 S","accountLink":"/user/id/977236847"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I am still emotional about this movie and I saw it last night","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T23:45:42.943Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T13:22:52.890Z","user":{"userId":"860709527","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/860709527"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Oh yeah, you need to see this like, yesterday!
