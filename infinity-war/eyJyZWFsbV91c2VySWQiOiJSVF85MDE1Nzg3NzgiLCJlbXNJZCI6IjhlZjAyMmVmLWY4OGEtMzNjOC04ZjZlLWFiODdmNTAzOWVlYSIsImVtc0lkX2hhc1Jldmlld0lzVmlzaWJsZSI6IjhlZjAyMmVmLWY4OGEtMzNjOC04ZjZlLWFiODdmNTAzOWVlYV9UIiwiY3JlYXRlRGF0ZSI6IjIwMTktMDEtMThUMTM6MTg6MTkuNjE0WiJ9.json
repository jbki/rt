Josh Brolin is the star in this, even though he is a CGI based character his acting shines through brighter than the rest by a long way.  The ending is mind boggling killing off so many core Avenger characters but I am sure I know exactly what will happen in the sequel 'Avengers-End Game' that is out this year (2019) as there are plenty of clues during the movie (hint 'Time Stone') as this money making juggernaut (2 Billion in theaters) needs all of these characters to go on making more and more money, as they inevitably will.","displayName":"Andrew A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-18T00:54:42.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-18T01:14:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"977580951","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew A","accountLink":"/user/id/977580951"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I don't know how they managed to put all its characters from different franchises and make it good.

It enables protagonist and antagonist alike to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.

Finally the film released and I and the other pundits of Super Cinema where blow away by it. The film is the perfect pay off of 10 years of memorizing and internalizing  the lore of the MCU and once End Game releases the only hope I have is that it makes this film even more outstanding. The Russo Brothers took something that shouldn't have worked with a cast this large and made a sweeping cinematic adventure that will go down in history as one of the biggest movie events of all time!\n\nMy Full Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iNCOePyc4o","displayName":"James S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-16T09:15:32.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-16T09:23:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"977732555","realm":"RT","displayName":"James S","accountLink":"/user/id/977732555"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"How does anyone like this lol","displayName":"Benaiah S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000108941336/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-16T07:36:33.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-16T07:37:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"880880959","realm":"RT","displayName":"Benaiah S","accountLink":"/user/id/880880959"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What an outstanding marvel movie with so many great characters that are surprisingly given a lot of development.\nWith fantastic action and special effects and an incredible emotional ending infinity war is probably the best film in the MCU yet.","displayName":"Jake B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-15T10:26:45.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-15T10:29:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"977531942","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jake B","accountLink":"/user/id/977531942"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Amazingly balanced, even with a big cgi monster as the villain, and they fixed their villain problem, you actually feel something for thanos.\nSome critics complain that you have to watch everything else in the franchise to sympathize with the characters, but this is NOT a stand alone movie, its the conclusion to a decade of work from the marvel team.\nI am extremely impressed by everything in this movie, and i would probably put it in my favorites of all time.","displayName":"Franklin S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-15T09:59:47.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-15T10:03:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"977733088","realm":"RT","displayName":"Franklin S","accountLink":"/user/id/977733088"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Truly the worst movie I have seen in my entire life.
