And haven't watch any super hero movies in years. I am actually really glad that I watched this film. It's an class A film made with class A production. Today I would rate the film before I review it, which I would give an A-. Go watch it in IMAX 3D, you will not regret it! Let's start the review! \nI watched a lot of trailers and other people's reviews before I went to the movie theater. Some say this is like an episode of TV show, it's just gonna show all your favorite characters in a stew and you have to buy it! Or some say, it's just another fast food franchise in the film industry. After watching the film I have to highly disagree. There are no signs of fast food equivalent and it's actually a really quality movie that I would recommend to everyone! \nThanks for the twelve writers to collaborate on this masterpiece. Anthony Russo and Joe Russo for directing and putting it together. It's a really detailed and lively universe. With all the complicated story and complex emotions, I was pulled into this fantasy world and enjoyed a great journey with all these heroic characters. The background, details and development are really carefully put together. Although, I wish maybe it can have less jokes and more information on the infinity stones, especially I don't follow all any of the marvel superhero's individual movies. There are a lot and different powers and informations regarding the stones that Thanos is collecting. I just wish if they can give at least maybe 2 more minutes to explain each stones. Later on in the film, you can see the powers and abilities of these stones in the combat. Therefore it would be better to put more emphasis on it. \nThroughout the film I clapped twice. First time is when Thanos collected all the stones. And second time was when the movie ends on the perfect note. I think it was the right amount of story and emotions, and I am looking forward for the part 2 of the Infinity War. Even this is a movie review, I don't like to give out spoilers. There are two major relationships that I would like to talk about. Number 1: Man & Power. Thanos really stole the show for me. His character design and development can be featured in a textbook like immediately. He is powerful, ambitious and dominant. But every strong person, have a weak spot, no spoilers. He is lonely and lost as the story develops. Also he is the key branch of the story, so the other storylines can wrap around it. Number 2: Screen & Audience relationship. This movie has very strong relationship to the audience, not only the characters were well-known to almost all the global citizens, but also captivating and interesting. Things were not forced or illogical. The whole movie is easy to understand and easy to enjoy. Directors and writers definitely have considered a lot from the audience's perspective. It's easy to catch on the story, and gives you enough thrill, action and dynamic. Slowly pulling you into the marvel universe and make you a fan! \nThat's all for this movie, remember to watch it in IMAX 3D, it does make a difference! Huge difference!!","displayName":"Robert J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T10:37:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T10:39:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"977203154","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert J","accountLink":"/user/id/977203154"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best movies I've ever seen","displayName":"Johnmaol M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T10:36:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T10:37:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250971","realm":"RT","displayName":"Johnmaol M","accountLink":"/user/id/977250971"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Literally a perfect movie for what it is. \n\n\n\nThe villain is outstanding, the acting is superb, the characters are fun.\n\n\n\nIf you have enjoyed ANY of the Marvel films, you need to see this movie.","displayName":"Hayden B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T10:31:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T10:31:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"926322991","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hayden B","accountLink":"/user/id/926322991"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best MCU movie, and one of the best fantasy movies ever, great plot, a lot of shoking/surprising moments.","displayName":"dodi a","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T10:30:15.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T10:31:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250955","realm":"RT","displayName":"dodi a","accountLink":"/user/id/977250955"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Geest movie, every character had the chance to schine.
