This certainly lives up to the hype that was built up for 10 years coming. The ending was a rather unexpected one but it leaves viewers with the urge to watch the sequel immediately. Will definitely watch it for another two times. To sum it up with 3 words: awesome, epic & amazing","displayName":"Adam N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T19:24:00.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T19:27:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"932363651","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adam N","accountLink":"/user/id/932363651"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"What a waste of time.

It was chopped up . Tried to tell way too many things. The best thing going was the fight scenes  And the best of those took place the first 20 minutes of the movie. And Hulk played the coward after getting his but handed to him. At least Thor was a bright spot.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2114444941918615/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T19:20:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T19:23:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"977240727","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977240727"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Im going to be extremely critical of this movie because ive been waiting years for this happen..action was great fun to watch..thanos was under powered as hell but imma let that slide and wont say anything else about it...people died as expected..story was just ok..they changed alot too much in my opinion..seems like they just skimmed the comic book and did what they wanted..ending kinda annoyed me..now i have to watch a tv series about a character i dont really care about to see what gonna happen between this movie and the next..why was thanos armor only on for like 3 mins and he never donned it again..i could keep going..oh yea the story was like did peoples contracts end or something cause wtf is this mess..everyone know thanos only love is mistress death...really marvel..really...you changed his WHOLE DAMN BACKSTORY..thats the point of this mess","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10160272571120512/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T19:16:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T19:26:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"977240718","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977240718"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"The movie as a whole was good, but the ending really just ruin it, there was not enough potential for the second part, they try to make a cliffhanger but there wasn't any kind suspense to follow it to the second movie, it was yours weird.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2124613547579321/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T19:16:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T19:19:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"977240717","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977240717"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Honestly it's just kind of a bad movie.

One would think due to the sheer volume of characters in this movie that many would be under utilised, however the director has pulled it off. 2 and a half hours of humour, action, evil and heartbreak balanced so perfectly throughout that the ending falls gracefully into place and is executed to perfection with a beautiful score to accompany. \n\nA very ambitious effort by the MCU, and sets up nicely for next years finale.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1916997378525225/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T19:14:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T19:18:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"977240714","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977240714"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Now that was a great movie!
