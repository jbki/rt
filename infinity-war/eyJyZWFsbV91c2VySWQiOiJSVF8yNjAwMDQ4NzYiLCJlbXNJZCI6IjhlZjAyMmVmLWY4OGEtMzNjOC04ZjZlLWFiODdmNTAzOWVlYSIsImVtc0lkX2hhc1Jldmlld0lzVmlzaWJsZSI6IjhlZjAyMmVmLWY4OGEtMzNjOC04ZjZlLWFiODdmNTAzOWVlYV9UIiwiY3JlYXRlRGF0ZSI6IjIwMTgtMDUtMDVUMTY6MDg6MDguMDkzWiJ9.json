Even though I'm writing this after one viewing, I can't think of a single thing I didn't like about it. Thanos wasn't the flat world conqueror I was worried he'd be, in fact he was really the driving force of the film and can be considered your perfect model utilitarian. There's a one call back I absolutely loved (and kinda called years back). I loved how this movie was both intergalactic and Earth-bound. Finally, I very much enjoyed how it both incorporated elements of the Infinity Gauntlet, and took a major deviation from its plan in a way that makes me immensely interested in how the MCU unfolds from this point forward.","displayName":"Nemo P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T15:37:02.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T15:37:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"949125778","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nemo P","accountLink":"/user/id/949125778"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This Movie Delivers Nearly 3 Hours Of A Multiple Emotion Roller Coaster 100% Worth It","displayName":"Kyle I","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T15:31:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-11-30T17:55:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"977258225","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kyle I","accountLink":"/user/id/977258225"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It is amazing how effectively this movie used a pantheon of Marvel super heroes and actors to tell such a coherent and well thought out tale.  The action and effects are fun to watch and the banter is great.  Which made the emotional impact of the dark ending all the more impactful.  Performances were great, and the background from the other movies allowed the story to really focus on Thanos and Gamorrah, resulting in one of the most interesting villains in comic book movie history.  Go into this buying into the Marvel mythology, and you will have great ride.","displayName":"Chris B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T15:29:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T15:43:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"977163603","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris B","accountLink":"/user/id/977163603"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent movie!
