The action was decent, great dialogue, as well as being able to see more of Thanos' character than we have previously, but the morals and the values the Avengers held weren't always clear at certpoints of the movie. Other than that, definite recommend.","displayName":"Christian D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-01T03:28:45.035Z","updateDate":"2019-07-01T03:30:34.949Z","user":{"userId":"978134397","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christian D","accountLink":"/user/id/978134397"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"An epic of a film only topped by Endgame!","displayName":"Christopher F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/594896991/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-06-30T17:00:36.519Z","updateDate":"2019-06-30T17:00:36.519Z","user":{"userId":"866167180","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christopher F","accountLink":"/user/id/866167180"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I enjoyed it everyone had good screen time and the action as handled so well and it had an amazing ending such a great film with amazing acting","displayName":"Harry L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/123833131404630/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-06-30T14:20:09.447Z","updateDate":"2019-06-30T14:20:09.447Z","user":{"userId":"975364364","realm":"RT","displayName":"Harry L","accountLink":"/user/id/975364364"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Avengers Infinity War Does What X-men Movies,Under the stewardship\nOf Fox Should have already done, but scratched the surface with X-men Days Of Future Past.
