Somehow might be one of the best movies Marvel has put out if not the best, definitely the best Avengers movie to date. If you're a fan of the characters you will be blown away by how they managed to fit them all into the story so well. Somehow Marvel pulled off a giant purple CGI Josh Brolin as the star of the movie. If you're a fan of Marvel films, see it.","displayName":"Jason C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/213900091/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T15:59:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T16:09:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"793327712","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jason C","accountLink":"/user/id/793327712"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Great action movie (the most action of any marvel film) but no similarity to the original comic book storyline. In the comics while in possession of the infinity gauntlet, Thanos was able go holdoff and over power the mightiest entities in the universe. However, in the movie he was getting beat by a handful of average super heroes - nonsense. Also, the movie was too long and contained alot of insignificant scenes. Maybe the best of alot of overrated Avenger movies. Black Panther was a better overall movie. Overall the worst of the 3 Russo brother films.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T15:56:18.001Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T16:17:51.241Z","user":{"userId":"955091987","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/955091987"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"3 marvel universes collide for a patchwork of a movie.","displayName":"Leandro P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T15:44:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T15:48:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"977077973","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leandro P","accountLink":"/user/id/977077973"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Bringing all the superheroes from the MCU, this movie has so much thrilling action sequences, as well as some humour and your favourite characters. One of the biggest Marvel superhero film yet, this is where the biggest battle begins! \nEven though there are too many characters in one film with so much plot happening, this Avengers film pleases me a lot. Great visual effects, great characters and exciting scenes, though some are heartbreaking. \nThis movie is surprisingly strong. 9/10","displayName":"Hartman C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1899055093752699/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T15:19:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T15:23:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"976520666","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hartman C","accountLink":"/user/id/976520666"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good action very exciting.
