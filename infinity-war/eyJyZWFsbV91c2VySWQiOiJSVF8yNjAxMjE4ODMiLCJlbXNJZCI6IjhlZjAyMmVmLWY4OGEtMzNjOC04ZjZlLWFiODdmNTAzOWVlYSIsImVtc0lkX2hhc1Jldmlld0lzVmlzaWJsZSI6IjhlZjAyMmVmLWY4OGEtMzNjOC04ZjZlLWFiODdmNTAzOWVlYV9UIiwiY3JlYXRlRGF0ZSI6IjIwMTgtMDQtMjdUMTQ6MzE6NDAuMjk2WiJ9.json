Ultimately I think they delivered big time though. This movie ended the way it needed to end and set up big game changers for the next generation of the MCU.

Superhero movies are supposed to be about the heroes undergoing trials and tribulations but coming out victorious in the end. This steaming pile of crap killed off most of the Disney Marvel franchise, as well as one of sony's, and they, and most of the universe, lost in the end. I found it a totally unsatisfying ending. I normally stay for the two cut scenes in the credits, but this time I just got up and left. I didn't expect them to be able to pull something humorous out of their butts after killing just about all the characters I cared about. Normally I go to Marvel movies twice, then buy the bluray when it comes it. For this one once was enough, and I'm sorry I ever went the once.","displayName":"Doug D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T14:29:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T14:32:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243505","realm":"RT","displayName":"Doug D","accountLink":"/user/id/977243505"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"the hole movie I was entertained the hole time waiting to see what would happen next. I love how everyone had there own personal beef with thanos an that's what really brought them together. I'll say they may have just struck us with the biggest cliff hanger of all time and now we have to wait another year to see what happens. Josh played thanos really well, they all did an amazing job but I feel like they really made thanos relatable. As soon as you would start laughing you would find yourself in disbelief.

Well...I can't really say much, as even the most minute spoiler would ruin everything. But I can say this, a big bad wants to bring together six powerful artifacts & use'em to do bad things, & it's up to all the Marvel heroes we've seen so far to stop them. That's all I can say, just see the movie. Trust me, it's better this way.\n\nThe cast has reached, IMHO, their acting peak. The heroes all feel like war veterans who've been recalled for one last mission, & they do NOT hold back! The villains all range from one dimensional video game bosses, to possibly one've the most layered & complex antagonists I've ever seen. The side characters range from surprising cameos, to stark examples of what the word \"war\" really means.\n\nThe effects have yet to disappoint me. I couldn't tell what was practical & what was CGI half the time, even most of the CG characters looked like people in makeup at times. There really is nowhere to go, in terms of visual effects, but maybe some kinda holographic tech yet to be made.\n\nThe music was PERFECT for setting the mood for this film! I wish I could say more, just trust me on this!\n\nAvengers: Infinity War really felt like the last chapter of a long book. A 5 star conclusion, hands down. This was like the end of Lord of the Rings in terms of finality, but streamlined. This story has ended, now on to the next!","displayName":"Joseph D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T14:25:02.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T14:26:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"935746037","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph D","accountLink":"/user/id/935746037"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I'll start this by saying that, other than the X-Men movies, Guardians of the Galaxy:Volume I was the only Marvel movie I've seen in theaters. Also, in relation, I haven't even seen a Marvel movie since Age of Ultron. For these reasons, I had my doubts about whether or not I'd enjoy this and not end up completely lost with no idea what was going on. Surprisingly, I didn't get lost watching it.\n1. I was really impressed at how well this movie was able to incorporate so many characters from so many different perspectives and not even stumble over itself at any point. It was very smooth and as long as the viewer is vaguely familiar with the characters it isn't all that necessary to see previous installments. Granted, it may be enjoyed more if you have seen the prior movies but the only one I see as close to necessary in order to know what's going on is Doctor Strange. \nThe characters coming together from all the different movies were probably the best parts and there were a lot of those interactions. Thor's interactions with the Guardians of the Galaxy were great, and the initial meeting between Iron Man, Hulk, and Doctor Strange was very good too. The new Spider-man even had a larger role than I was expecting and his age didn't really seem out of place. As for Thanos, his exact motives for wanting to do what he does are a little bit iffy but him being evil is kinda all the explanation you need because that's what evil does.\nThe bottom lines are that this is a very solid movie and the fact that it is so many installments deep into the story and still able to remain mostly hole free and manage to stand on its own is a testament to how good it is. The special effects, of course, were a spectacle but with much of the movie being set in space they were somehow a natural fit and easier to digest than if set on Earth. I thought the end of this movie was great and the after credits scene with Samuel L. Jackson's apparent fate is the best thing to happen to cinema in decades. I am really hooked now... better late than never. This is probably my favorite of all Marvel's Avenger's related movies so how I cannot...\n9 of 10 ","displayName":"Jeffrey P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T14:24:43.000Z","updateDate":"2019-07-26T22:09:42.540Z","user":{"userId":"976433996","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeffrey P","accountLink":"/user/id/976433996"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
