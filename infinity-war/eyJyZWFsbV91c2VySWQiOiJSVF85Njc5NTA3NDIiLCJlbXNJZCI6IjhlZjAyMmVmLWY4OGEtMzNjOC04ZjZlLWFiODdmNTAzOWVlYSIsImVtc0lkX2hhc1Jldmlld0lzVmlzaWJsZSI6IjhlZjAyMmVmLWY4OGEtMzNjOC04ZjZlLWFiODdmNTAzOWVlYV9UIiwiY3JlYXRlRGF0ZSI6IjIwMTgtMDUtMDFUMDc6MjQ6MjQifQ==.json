It's impressive to see the Russo brothers tackle such a huge crossover like this, the Russo brothers have proven once again that they are the best hands the MCU could possibly be in.\nHowever I feel they did not give enough screen time to black panther and the Wakandans, along with captain America and his band of heroes in contrast to team iron man and Thor which are the strong points of this film. In conclusion, Avengers infinity war is in the top five best MCU films, it is also a beautifully crafted movie with twists and turns at every corner","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2020032281593684/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T06:59:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T07:07:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977252309","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977252309"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This movie wraps its arms around its comic book roots and gives them a big, sloppy, wet kiss. While some of the previous movies have attempted to make the fantastic elements feel at least possible or grounded in some reality, the MCU has finally allowed themselves to not be overly concerned with that - a likely necessity in a film that literally spans both the planet and the galaxy at breakneck speeds.\nIt is just what I expected - action heavy, plot light, with extremely limited character development.  It goes from battle to battle, giving the audience just enough room to say, \"Wow.\" before moving to the next remarkable moment.  The CGI is well done, which is important, because there is a LOT of it.\nThis is not a film for someone new to the MCU, there is so much to absorb and process, and so many little moments that reference previously established events, that a newcomer will likely be asking, \"Who is that? Why did they get a close up just then?\" often.  That's not a problem, but anyone who hasn't seen most of the prior films, or at the very least Civil War, Guardians 2, Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther (It's also helpful to have seen Dr. Strange, Spider-Man:Homecoming and Winter soldier for full character backgrounds) will be lost.\nAnother word of caution: If you have younger fans that you normally take, PREVIEW THIS ONE before taking them to see it.  There are some moments that may be too intense or difficult to understand, especially for a kid going in wearing their favorite hero on their shirt and leaving thinking that one is gone for good.  The violence is not gory, but it does suggest loss at a high level, more so than any other film in this genre to date.\nIt will likely get mixed response because it is so big, fast and focused on the MacGuffin collection over character. For me, it was just like getting the next issue of my favorite comic and finding it was full of splash pages that show everyone in motion at the same time. It was worth the price of admission, but I will be even more pleased when I can see it along with the follow up next year.","displayName":"JR J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T06:52:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T07:48:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"977252297","realm":"RT","displayName":"JR J","accountLink":"/user/id/977252297"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best MCU movie ever.
