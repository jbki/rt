I mean, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie with virtually no complaints, or regrets. This is the type of film that  you want to keep watching over and over again. There was plenty of action, sacrifice, and heart to carry this movie. From start to finish this movie was a blast; everything about this movie was predominantly lovable and intriguing. Not only were the main characters compelling, but the villian was also very complex and memorable. The movie was 2 hours and 36 minutes; furthermore, the movie successful packed much material within its lengthy duration. I also found the movie to bit philosophical, especially the nature of the six Infinity Stones that Thanos acquired. I hope that- minus fifty percent of the galaxies' population that turned into ashes at the snap of a finger- the remaining characters are able to reverse the effects.Great movie! Excited to see the still untitled Avengers 4 movie in 2019.","displayName":"Elijah O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-02T16:01:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-02T16:12:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"977083396","realm":"RT","displayName":"Elijah O","accountLink":"/user/id/977083396"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"This is definitely the on-set to Infinity War 2.  This movie reminds me of the Harry Potter: Deathly Hallows: Part 1 & 2.  The first was not nearly as good as the second, but the first did a successful job in setting the second one up.  With that similar feeling, Avengers: Infinity War is successful.  The over abundance of characters can make the story hard to follow, especially if you have not seen ALL of the previous Marvel films.  However, Infinity War does build off success from Thor: Ragnarok.  With so many characters, luckily we are blessed that this Avengers movie does focus more primarily on Thor.  He is funny, smart, good-looking, and the only one you really feel throughout the movie has a chance to defeat Thanos.  The fight scenes are big and bold, but hopefully the second movie will have a more straight-forward script.\n\nSPOILER ALERT: Given that half of the population dies at the end of the movie, we are left with what we originally started with, the original Avengers.  Thor, Hulk, Captain America, and Iron Man all survive to bring the movie back to the originality of the very first Avengers movie.","displayName":"Devon D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-02T15:45:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-02T15:56:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"977303330","realm":"RT","displayName":"Devon D","accountLink":"/user/id/977303330"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"FANTASTIC -- seriously this is the best one so far!","displayName":"Andrea M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10152837408156740/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-02T15:20:15.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-02T15:20:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"970726260","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrea M","accountLink":"/user/id/970726260"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The dialogue was terrible.
