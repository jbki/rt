The hilarious comedy mixed with the action packed scenes and plenty of drama sends you on a roller coaster ride throughout the whole movie. Saw an 11:00 pm showing after a full days work, so I didn’t get out until 2 am, and the movie flew by, energizing me. Would love to see again.

If thor can make a hammer, why he wouldn't made it when asgard is falling in ragnarok. Star lord is so childish, it's stupid act. Maybe it'll be good movie if everything has a good explanation or making sense. because from what i've seen, the story is kinda feel forced to connect everything, so sometimes while wacthing i keep complaining about strange or when it's start to keep non sense act. but overall, it's still good a movie, i just expect it'll be more interesting","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10203799443935696/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T18:03:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T18:10:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246932","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977246932"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"These professional reviewers dont really matter tbh. I think people should go see the movie, because it is one of the best mcu movies if not then is the best. People are talking about the cliffhanger or satisfying ending. Thing is that what that gave us at the end is all you need to know and that's just the fact they leave us with the original avengers the ones who started it all and that they will be going to find Thanos, who is thought to have finally found peace with their plans. To be honest, there's no cliffhanger.  Just the fact that the original mcu avengers along Ant-man, Hawkeye, Captain Marvel, nebula and rocket will go after  Thanos. It should be really 89+ rating , but we have professional reviewers who i can say most of them have never read the comics or know that much about marvel to be reviewing this, but they do so anyway and for what they don't understand, they drag the movie rating down. All I can say is whatever the tomatoes score for this movie is, It is one of the best superhero and action flick movie of all time.","displayName":"Zaire J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/780713205392020/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T18:02:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T18:13:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"973874896","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zaire J","accountLink":"/user/id/973874896"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best mo it's I have ever seen.
