I loved that they changed it up and made the villain, Thanos, the focal point of the story. The Russo brothers did a great job with balancing out all of the hero's screentime.

It was an amazing compilation and integration of all the movies that has made Marvel into a phenomenon. My only criticism is that the movie was extremely fast and covered a lot of territory while leaving some thoughts unfinished and characters undeveloped. Though it accomplished an oddessy like non other, it would not hurt to slow it down next time and either lengthen or create two movies out of one episode to allow for juicier development and more impactful scenes.
