I am a TRUE fanboy! I’ve loved super heroes and comic books for decades! Wether it’s graphic novels, television series or movies, I absorb as much of it as I can! That being said, Avengers Infinity War is the finest cinematic expression of comic books/superheroes that has ever graced the silver screen. It is so sublimely done, I found myself grinning, uncontrollably, from ear to ear throughout the film. Two and half hours went by like nothing, and at the end, all I wanted was more! Everything was perfectly coordinated and expertly culminated in what, to date, is Marvels apex creation. In summation, this movie defines what is a blockbuster and works on virtually every level. SEE THIS MOVIE NOW! On a final note, this is the only 5 star rating I have ever given.

It does have some good moments and it's fun to see some of these heroes interacting together in one movie. And some of the battle scenes are cool, but the real problem is these deaths everyone is so excited about are (I'm not going to give away who dies, but you might consider my comment about it a spoiler)...not credible. By that I mean I do not believe for one millisecond that any of the heroes who died are actually going to stay dead. This isn't even a case of \"if I'm wrong I'll...\" I'll nothing because there is zero chance -- ZERO -- that they are going to stay dead.  And if I don't believe, even a little bit, the central emotional thing that happens in this movie, then I'm sorry to say....it's not good. Black Panther and a half a dozen other movies were better than this. Even that battle in Wakanda everyone knows from the trailers could have been better (though it was good). The Battle of The Bastards in Game of Thrones was better. The Battle Of Helms Deep in LOTR was better. I left the theater thinking, well...it's a comic book movie. Maybe I'm just too old for that. And you, dear reader, just might be too.","displayName":"Edward W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T21:00:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T21:15:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"976833907","realm":"RT","displayName":"Edward W","accountLink":"/user/id/976833907"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Worst avengers movie the past 10 years by far!
