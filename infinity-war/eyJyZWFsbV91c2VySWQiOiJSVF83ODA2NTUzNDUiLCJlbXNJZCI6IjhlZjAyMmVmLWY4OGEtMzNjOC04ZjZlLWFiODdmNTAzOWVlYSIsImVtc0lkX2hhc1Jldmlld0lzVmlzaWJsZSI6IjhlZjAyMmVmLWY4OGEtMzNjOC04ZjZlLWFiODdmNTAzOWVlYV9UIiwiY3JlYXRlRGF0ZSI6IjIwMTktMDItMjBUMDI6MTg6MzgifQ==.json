The CGI from this movie was the thing that more impressed me, more than the Doctor Strange's movie one. Something that perturbed me was the coincidences, like Peter Parker (Tom Holland) passing on the school trip bus at the exact moment that the Black Order space-shift was arriving on Earth. Or the Thor body being encountered for the Guardians, that was the only ones who attended to the Asgardian 911. But, at the final, at the conclusion, a great history that took 10 years for writing, finished with the defeated Earth's Mightest Heroes.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2188268461422806/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-02-19T11:57:02.000Z","updateDate":"2019-02-19T12:45:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"977809828","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977809828"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"If you like superhero movies, this is your kind of jam.
