InfinityWar had a perfect blend of comedy and action throughout the run time.  And although this was a much darker and more gritty movie within the MCU, it wasn't overwhelming in the slightest.  Great job by the Russo brothers once again.  Absolutely can't wait to see where the MCU goes from here.","displayName":"Tucker W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002460326859/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T17:02:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T17:08:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"922645766","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tucker W","accountLink":"/user/id/922645766"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Movie was amazingly played out, Thanos is such a twisted and evil villain it really helps tie the movie together! 10/10 for me!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T17:01:22.864Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T17:01:22.864Z","user":{"userId":"260087889","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260087889"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Best marvel movie ever made, solid on every level.

It is the *start* of the culmination. Understanding that will help temper expectations that are sure to be higher than anything that can ever be reached. \n\nThere is a trope known as \"continuity lockout,\" and it refers to newcomers not being able to understand the character or story if they arrive late in the game. With 10 years and 18 interconnected movies in this lore, continuity lockout is necessary for the story to continue. \n\nThis movie is about plot. All of the characterizations of the players have been established in the previous movies, and this movie does not give any more development. The heroes that we know are at the service of the story, and their motivations are all the same: stop Thanos. \n\nThis is Thanos's story (and consequently, Gamora's). It's his quest that we are intrigued by, and thank goodness that he is an interesting character to watch. He's a terrible individual, but his strength, cunning, and depth of emotion make him the most dangerous villain seen in the MCU. \n\nWhile the heroes are limited in the development of their characters, that does not mean that they are uninteresting to watch. The reason for that is because of the masterful establishment of their characters over previous installments by the producers and actors. At no point did I feel anything but genuine honesty coming from these characters and actors. \n\nInfinity War is done. Now comes the long wait for the next installment of The Avengers, an installment that for the first time, I can honestly say that I have no idea what will happen.","displayName":"Omar L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T16:58:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T16:58:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"797612627","realm":"RT","displayName":"Omar L","accountLink":"/user/id/797612627"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
