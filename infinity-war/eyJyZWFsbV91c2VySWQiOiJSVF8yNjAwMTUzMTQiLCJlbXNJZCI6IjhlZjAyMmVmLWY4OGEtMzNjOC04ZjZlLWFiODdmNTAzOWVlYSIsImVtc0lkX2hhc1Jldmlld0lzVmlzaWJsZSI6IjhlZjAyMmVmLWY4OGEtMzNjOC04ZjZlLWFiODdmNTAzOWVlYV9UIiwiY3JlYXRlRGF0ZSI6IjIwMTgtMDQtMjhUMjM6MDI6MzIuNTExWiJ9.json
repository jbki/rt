Yes it was jam-packed with characters and subplots; this was a given. In spite of this, the Russo brothers did a great job conveying a myriad of emotions throughout. The comic relief was there when it needed to be and didn't go overboard.\n\nIf I had to give it a rating, I would say 8.8/10. Go watch this movie.

I just can't believe you guys did it. Basically fuck Hollywood ????\nYou guys made the PERFECT COMIC BOOK MOVIE.\nAnd it couldn't have worked better if Marvel Studios did not set up this 10 years plan.\n\nWow wow wow wow WOW\n\nPS: don't compare this to that crap movie Last Jedi. That movie killed it's own trilogy by second film after two years from it's first chapter. While Infinity War was a combination of ten years build set of 15 films.

Action was intense throughout the film though. Seemed like a Thor movie as it took us along his journey of avenging his planet, getting a new weapon, a new eye, making a huge entrance to the wakanda battle, and delivering the last blow on Thanos. Every other avenger was just a cameo besides maybe ironman & the guardians, but the guardians were only there to save Thor.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T22:55:52.334Z","updateDate":"2018-05-28T14:25:50.313Z","user":{"userId":"931596861","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/931596861"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wow amazing to see a movie that's a mechanism of so many moving parts and seamlessly taking long existing characters giving them all somthing to do and story arcs while introducing them to other characters new to them but we known for a long time and making the new interaction feel genuine so you can pin point who likes or hates who who respects or looks down on the new interactions. On top of  that you give levity and gravity( literally ) to a completely cgi villan a centre the story around him and his beginning middle and end and leaving every other character on a monumental cliffhanger both surprises and leaving you with a full story in its own right besides a culmination of eveything that came before it a one for fans and anyone  who just like great stories being told with spectacular effects and making you want more 360 days and counting  excelsior!","displayName":"Cole D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/514836659/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T22:55:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T23:20:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"786547148","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cole D","accountLink":"/user/id/786547148"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What an awesome ride!","displayName":"Dave W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T22:53:00.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T22:53:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"914150163","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dave W","accountLink":"/user/id/914150163"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Too much happening, too jumpy fro sequence to sequence And they tried too hard worse than Iron man 3","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T22:52:31.593Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T22:52:31.593Z","user":{"userId":"958286477","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/958286477"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Absolutely terrific movie!!
