I felt tricked upon leaving the cinema because I'm totally fine with the film as it is--but there is CLEARLY going to be another film attached to this one and the movie company was selling this as a single film picture. Not cool, studio, not cool.\n\nAnyway, that gripe aside it's a well made film. I was impressed with how they handled so many characters because usually the more characters there are the worse the film is--not necessarily so in this film, they focus on the characters they need to for plot/character development and use everyone else is in backup/cameo roles. So despite the fact that there have to be over 20 recognizeable faces in this film they focused the attention where it should be.\n\nHere are my main takeaways from the film:\n* Thanos is surprisingly chill for the murderous guy they hyped him up to be in other films. In some ways I thought this was good because Marvel usually has a problem making good, empathetic villains (aside from Loki) but in other ways I thought it was a bit of a detriment because he had far too much of a \"kind\" persona for the murdering actions he was taking. So I'm a bit on the fence about this.\n* The Spiderman/Tony parting scene was easily the best in the film. I haven't seen the new Spiderman films yet but that moment made me interested in giving them a view.\n* The Phantom Menace-type battle wasn't really important but I guess they needed to give the side characters something to do. I kind of wish they'd just fought the children of Thanos, though, the one on one battles were way more interesting than the hordes of creatures we know aren't going to kill our heroes anyway.\n* Why was that one daughter of Thanos CGI? It was quite distracting because she looked like she could have very easily just been an actor in makeup. I didn't see any point in making her CGI, and the effects were not very well done so it was distracting. But Thanos himself had great CGI and never once looked out of place, so that part's good.\n* Starlord's mess up (phrased as nonspoilery as possible), Starlord isn't a total idiot and I didn't appreciate how he made such a humongously stupid decision in this film. Didn't seem in character for him at all, he would have waited 20 seconds.\n\nSo in general it was a well made film that balanced having so many characters pretty well and had a nice, relateable villain. BUT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED PART 1, (I'm still a bit mad about being tricked like that).","displayName":"Carlotta 4","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-04T08:14:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-21T12:21:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"904384280","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carlotta 4","accountLink":"/user/id/904384280"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"more of a great hero mash-up than a great movie but still awesome!","displayName":"Rudy R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/750775584/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-04T08:07:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-04T08:09:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"814193297","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rudy R","accountLink":"/user/id/814193297"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Long live Thanos R.I.P.
