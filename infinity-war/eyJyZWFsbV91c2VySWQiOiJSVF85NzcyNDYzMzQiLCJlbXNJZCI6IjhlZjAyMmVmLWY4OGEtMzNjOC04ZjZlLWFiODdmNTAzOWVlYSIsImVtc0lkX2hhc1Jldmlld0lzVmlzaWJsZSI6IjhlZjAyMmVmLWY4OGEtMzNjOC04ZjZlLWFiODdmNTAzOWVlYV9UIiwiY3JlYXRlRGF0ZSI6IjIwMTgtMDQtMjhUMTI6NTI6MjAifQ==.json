It was everything I wanted. This is a marvel film that goes into different direction. It was funny, sad, heartbreaking, thrilling and dark.

Every character's power is conveniently reduced for feeble drama attempts (may work for grade school fans?) and lamely delayed 'power' reveals when they need feeble boosts in the poorly made up story (HULK in Iron Man suit, Thor a pussy for over 2 hours, Vision a mamby pansey baby for entire movie - need I cont?). \nAnd the pace is slower than infinity, and my friends called it 'Infinity Bore' straightaway. \nEach character is weak both in their all known powers, and intelligence, so we all guessed that the new order of superhero movie writing is simply to add comedic one liners every five minutes in order to make up for this, then lack of climatic potency means now to add caveman dumb drama writing and just kill off characters as needed; certainly a recipie for a disasterous unentertaining mess.\nThis is one of the worst movies ever made if judged by real substance.\nI am positive that all of these superhero and Star Wars movies have now degraded so long now that the sheer fanfare and scale of this flop have fooled many in contrast; evident by it tricking everyone to be anything beyond a 55/100 on RT. And I thought the Transformers movies took movies down so many notches, these almost write themselves (like a Bond film), so f**king it up is almost impossible - almost infinitely so! So-so-so dumb. Tortuously so.","displayName":"Jay F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T12:48:32.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T14:05:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"976614215","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jay F","accountLink":"/user/id/976614215"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"WOW.

But I would like to point that the movie was a bit too short, what I mean by that is that it should have included some more scenes for the characters that were left out a bit and also to explain some transitions between a scene and another. I know that 150 minutes are  a lot, but it is still a really big movie, I just can't be roughly as long as Captain America Civil War. Also,  the Russo Brothers were wrong about a thing (using Avengers Infinity War part 1 and part 2 titles) , this kinda looks like an half completed movie, but only partly. Besides all of this, it definitely is (at least) better than Avengers 2.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/581322255569701/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T12:47:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-05T03:07:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246321","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977246321"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is incredible.
