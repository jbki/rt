Killing off the franchises most popular characters (one of which in the first few minutes) causes the attempted humor to fall flat and Marvel's usual charm to sink down to the level of DC's depressing grittiness. Definitely not what I've come to expect from Marvel's usually colorful and witty cinematic universe.","displayName":"Cade G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T16:42:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T16:56:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246759","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cade G","accountLink":"/user/id/977246759"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wow, the movie isn't light hearted like other Marvel movies.

With a premise that puts everything at stake (and I mean EVERYTHING) and a cast more than qualified, Infinity War boasts an amazing film score, amazing cinematography and an ending that either breaks you or leaves you with your jaw open. While it is a love letter to fans, the pacing occasionally felt unbalanced and sometimes the constant switching of group focus could get confusing. However, Marvel handled a giant cast of heroes with elegance and finnese, bringing to life a villain who leaves all other marvel villains in the dust. Infinity War is a film to cherish, praise and share.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1811470349173910/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T16:41:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T16:49:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246752","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977246752"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It's a mediocrely good film.\nMade me cry, made me laugh, it is made  really well but at times its cringeworthy and boaring. \nSome polishing to do but its stil good.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/242135016551867/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T16:40:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T17:00:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246750","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977246750"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was amazing.
