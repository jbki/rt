Disappointing. They destroyed the integrity of the story they built up from the first scene in this movie.

This movie didn't matter. \nInstead of a cliff hanger they just made the cliff disappear.","displayName":"Rebecca F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/670608562/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T21:03:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T21:09:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"799777985","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rebecca F","accountLink":"/user/id/799777985"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"}]}
