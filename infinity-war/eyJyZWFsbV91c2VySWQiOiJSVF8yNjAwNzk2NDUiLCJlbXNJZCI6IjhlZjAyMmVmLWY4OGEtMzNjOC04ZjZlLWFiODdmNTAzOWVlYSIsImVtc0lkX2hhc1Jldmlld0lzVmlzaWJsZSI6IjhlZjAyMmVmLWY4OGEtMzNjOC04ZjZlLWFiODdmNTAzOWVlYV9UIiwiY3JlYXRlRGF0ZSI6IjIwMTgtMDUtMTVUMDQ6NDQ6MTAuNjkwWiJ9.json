However I ended up enjoying the movie but took some time to get the ball rolling. At the start I was completely captivated it took a darker tone to the series which was really good and completely unexpected. After the beginning I didn't know where they were going to go with it, however it began to get more interesting as characters who never interacted before began to interact with each other, however that's when the fun sort of ends for a while... the middle felt long and felt like it was dragging for way longer than it should have, then the ending happened... I have no idea if the actors were told what was going to happen but I expected more, every actor just seemed to accept what was happening apart from one or two reactions... then it just ended. Story was over and that was it, I was left wanting more but not in a good way. \nOverall I felt like it was all right, but a few parts made me want more. On a side note the \"jokes\" if being a little bit comedic is what they're going for, NEEDS TO BE BETTER! Drax who at this point I've placed as the most irritating mcu character of all time, there was a joke with Spider-Man and dr strange that didn't seem to be a mcu \"joke\" but was rather funny (scene they talk about names) the mcu needs more moments like this.

It combindes mostly The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy and sort of Civil War, which is some of my top 3 favorite movis in the MCU, despite this one. What especially worked for me where the fact that it had all these characters, all that humor and some serious moments and they worked. The humor didn´t over throw the serious moments in this film and it weren't confusing what was going on, even though there were so many characters. So all in all, great story, good acting, action and humor and i´am close to say a perfect movie, but with all movies comes also some floors. For instance the opening scene were Thanos and his children conquered the Asguardian ship were a little bit meh i think. Because i liked the fight scenes and i´am okay with Loke and Heimdal dieing, but the real issue i had with this scene were that all the asguardians died, only Thor were back alive and the reason this trickers me a little bit is because they just had been saved from Thor, Hulk, Valkarie and Loke and then nope Thanos don´t care and just killed them all, so... R.I.P the asguardians. And then also the fact that most of the avengers seems pretty darn small and powerless in front of Thanos  and his children. But that all doesn´t matter so much because i still very much love this movie and it absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2098502263759149/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T01:37:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T02:07:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"977269424","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977269424"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Painful to watch.
