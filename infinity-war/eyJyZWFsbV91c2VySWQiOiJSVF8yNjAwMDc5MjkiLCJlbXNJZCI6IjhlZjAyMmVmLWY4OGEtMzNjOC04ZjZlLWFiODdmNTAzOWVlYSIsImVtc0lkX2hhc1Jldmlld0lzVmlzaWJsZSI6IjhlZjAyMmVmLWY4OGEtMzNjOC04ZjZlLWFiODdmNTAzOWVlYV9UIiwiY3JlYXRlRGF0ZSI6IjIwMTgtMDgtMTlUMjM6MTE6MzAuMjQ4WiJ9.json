An ultimate being who can do anything with the snap of a finger is completely undefeatable end of story.  The purpose of super heroes is to fight super villains and they should be somewhat evenly matched to make the fight interesting. Introducing an omnipotent god as a villain against the avengers is ridiculous; it's like having Mike Tyson in his prime having a fist fight with a 10 week premature baby. The movie should have been 5 seconds long - camera pans to Thanos who snaps his fingers then the screen goes black and the credits role.","displayName":"Peter W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10154440834708996/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-19T08:02:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-19T08:30:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"976074742","realm":"RT","displayName":"Peter W","accountLink":"/user/id/976074742"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great film, can't wait to see what will come next.","displayName":"Scott S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1340615169/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-19T07:29:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-19T07:30:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"909381554","realm":"RT","displayName":"Scott S","accountLink":"/user/id/909381554"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Terrible!

It pulls off a small miracle, balancing such a wide array of characters and keeping everything in sync, tonally, while still maintaining its own identity. The sense of scope with the impending doom, is actually one you feel in your gut. It's hard to shake. And it sports one of the strongest villains to come around in a long long time.

Though most of the people that read the original Marvel comics will know about this, Marvel changed up the background for the movie a little bit. In the comics(now it's been a while so I'm sorry and please correct me if I'm wrong), the entire reason Thanos wanted to do any of this was to impress Death herself(yes Death is a she). And she claimed the only way to do so would be to kill half of the universe. But, in the movie, Thanos claimed that killing only half of the universe would bring peace, getting rid of hunger/starvation and lack of resources for the amount of... living beings, due to lack of words, as he explains to Gamora when he explains why he slaughtered half of her people long ago. though I personally would love to see the comic books way, bringing Death and the reasons Thanos cannot yet have her(which brings Deadpool into the mix but he isn't a part of this so just see my review of Deadpool 2 coming here soon for that info) into it, I do understand why they didn't do it that way. 1, it probably would've added about 30 minutes to the already 2 and a half hour long movie. And 2, they would have to pretty much completely change some of the backstories of other characters like Gamora, obviously. But overall, the movie was very entertaining and pushed my level of expectation through the roof. And, I must admit, I did cry near the end, especially when Spiderman started \"drifting\" so to speak.","displayName":"Caleb S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-19T00:55:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-19T01:18:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"977427587","realm":"RT","displayName":"Caleb S","accountLink":"/user/id/977427587"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 19, 2018"}]}
