I've seen it probably about 10 times at this point and it does not get old. Seeing it opening night in theaters was hands down the best cinematic experience I've ever had (along with Endgame). Infinity War was the PERFECT payoff of 10 years of building and carefully crafting this universe. One of my favorite movies of all time.","displayName":"Paula A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-05-06T22:41:40.000Z","updateDate":"2019-05-06T22:44:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"963602439","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paula A","accountLink":"/user/id/963602439"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This generation's Empire strikes back.\n\nA comic book masterpiece.","displayName":"arch m","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-05-06T06:48:41.000Z","updateDate":"2019-05-06T06:49:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"977253948","realm":"RT","displayName":"arch m","accountLink":"/user/id/977253948"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2019"}]}
