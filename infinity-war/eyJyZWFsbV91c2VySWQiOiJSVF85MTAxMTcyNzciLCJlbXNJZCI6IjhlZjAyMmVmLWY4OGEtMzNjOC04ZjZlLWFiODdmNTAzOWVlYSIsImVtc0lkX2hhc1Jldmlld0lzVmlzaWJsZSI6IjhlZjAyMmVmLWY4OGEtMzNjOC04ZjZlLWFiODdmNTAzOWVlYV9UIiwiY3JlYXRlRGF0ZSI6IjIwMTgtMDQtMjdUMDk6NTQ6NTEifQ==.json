What these directors the Russo Brothers have done is nothing short of miraculous: they gather the entire Marvel superhero universe we know and love and mash it all up. Their movie is packed full of twists, turns and surprises. It's dark, very emotional and no holds barred. The onslaught starts within the first minutes. It's a total assault on the senses. Death, destruction, mayhem and doom, and yet at the same time it's incredibly funny. It doesn't let up for 2 hours plus as it hurtles towards its climax. Tears? Yes, lots. Laughter? Loads. Hairs standing on end? Yes, all the way through. The ending is just staggering. No one ever ever envisaged what happens and you are left stunned, breathless, exhausted and an emotional wreck in your seat utterly devastated and heartbroken. Silence in the theatre. I've never ever had a movie experience like it where you run through every emotion possible.\n\nYour mind then retraces what you have just seen in the context of all the other 18 movies trying to make sense of it all. It makes sense but yet somehow it doesn't. How can that ending possibly have happened? We need to go watch the movie again several more times. \n\nAs Marvel fans who have grown to love all these characters, we have waited and waited for this movie to arrive. It hasn't disappointed us in the slightest. Thor is now my favourite Avenger! It has done something remarkable and exceeded all our expectations. This is superlative movie making. This is how superhero movies should be made. Genius movie making by the Russo Brothers!","displayName":"Norman A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/744736854/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T09:46:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T09:54:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"819899491","realm":"RT","displayName":"Norman A","accountLink":"/user/id/819899491"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Infinity war is the best superhero movie like the 1st one and I can't wait for avengers 4","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1915604625139062/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T09:46:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T09:47:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"977242748","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977242748"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"the best marvel film to date","displayName":"shrek f","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T09:46:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T12:29:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"977129480","realm":"RT","displayName":"shrek f","accountLink":"/user/id/977129480"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
