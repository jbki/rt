I know that it's a very small force but I still can't believe people thought Thanos was a weak villain. Thanos was the best part of the movie except maybe for Thor. People may say that the ending sucks because they kill off half the heroes (and the Russo Brothers did confirm that all the deaths were real) but that's what makes Infinity war special! Without something as dramatic as killing off even main characters such as Spiderman and Star Lord, this would just be another superhero movie,  and nothing more. Thanos had a clear and amazing backstory, I think all the characters got just the right amount of screen time, and I think they did really well with not giving thanos a big character introduction. He has plenty of arc, but we've been hearing about thanos since 2011 in Avengers, so he didn't need setup. I wouldn't change I thing about this movie, I just want to see it more!","displayName":"Kaden M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-17T09:51:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-17T09:55:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"977032749","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kaden M","accountLink":"/user/id/977032749"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A ton of fast paced entertainment and much more fun than the majority of superhero blockbusters","displayName":"Jayson R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-17T09:01:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-17T09:02:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"977272651","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jayson R","accountLink":"/user/id/977272651"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"TREMENDOUSLY INTRIGUING BEST MOVIE IVE SEEN","displayName":"James C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-17T08:59:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-17T09:00:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"977272685","realm":"RT","displayName":"James C","accountLink":"/user/id/977272685"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great extension of the MCU.
