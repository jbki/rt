The main character, Thanos, was a fantastic villain, still being hated because of his murderous intentions, we still believe his goals are understandable and still feel sympathy for his sacrifices in finding that goal. Most of the characters were outstanding in their quest of defeating Thanos. The movie still had its flaws, like the character's overall ranking of power was completely scrambled and diversified. Many of the characters who were meant to be either weaker or more powerful than one another was reversed. In conclusion, the move was overall fantastic and constructed with care.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/560790857743085/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-16T18:06:42.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-16T18:16:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"977985666","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977985666"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best movie of ever","displayName":"Solomon B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-16T10:58:08.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-16T10:58:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"977300580","realm":"RT","displayName":"Solomon B","accountLink":"/user/id/977300580"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Need the sequel fast","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/294691851455739/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-16T02:23:43.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-16T02:24:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"977984669","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977984669"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The gripping onslaught of kick assery that is the prequel to the end....

James Brolin is perfect as Thanos, probably the most interesting character in this movie. Ruthless, Brooding, Plodding and Self confident. He acts as if no one is his equal. The first scene in the movie is the best. Even with just a silhouette, he appears stronger than anyone in that scene and then what he does.\nSecond best scene would be the Forge Stormbreaker scene. Beautifully done to show where Mjolnir was forged and how Thor gets his new weapon.\nAnd the scene where Stark is losing Spidey (Holland).\nWakanda scenes are good and enjoyable.\nRest of the scenes are done well.\nNow, the quibbles. Story needs to be more robust, and/or a bit of tweaking. I know, I know, everybody is a screenwriter, so I won't mention any story ideas which I do have. But basically its Thanos' quest for the infinity stones and what he does with it.\nGive him something to worry about..\nAlso, some of the jokes may come at the wrong time... After Peter Quill and group found Thor, don't have him joke around.. he just lost everything.. Thor opens up to Rocket, but not until a few scenes later..\nI can go on and on.. but hey, everybody is a critic.\nBottom line.. good and enjoyable movie..","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/415947105849176/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-15T01:12:58.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-15T01:39:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977982955","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977982955"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"very impressive filming with a characteristic lead","displayName":"leo z","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-14T22:15:14.000Z","updateDate":"2019-05-22T23:42:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"977970487","realm":"RT","displayName":"leo z","accountLink":"/user/id/977970487"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"NoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoiceNoice","displayName":"Lloyd J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-14T18:58:24.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-14T18:59:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"977982014","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lloyd J","accountLink":"/user/id/977982014"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 14, 2019"}]}
