Like Dark Knight Rises it is so epic sized that it's too big to take in, but any flaws are forgiven because Marvel has by now earned the right to make a big bloated beast of a movie just for the fans (like me). The critical acclaim is a surprise to me, and gives hope that the public might be able to navigate it. If so, then it's the true heir to the original Star Wars trilogy. A pop culture epic that will inspire generations.","displayName":"Tony I","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1140396943/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T06:57:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T07:07:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"827712278","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tony I","accountLink":"/user/id/827712278"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Just one word....

A bombshell of a film from start to finish, it almost feels like an MCU movie version of Game of Thrones with separate plot lines coming together for an epic conclusion. However, it does enough for each individual character where as an audience, you feel invested in their story as each conflict develops. This project was always going to be hugely complex, and I couldn't have asked for a better result as a fan. This is the shortest 2 hours and 40 minutes you will ever experience at a theater, and it represents a rare time where a film of this magnitude truly lives up to the hype it deserved.","displayName":"Seth B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T06:57:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T07:32:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"977242295","realm":"RT","displayName":"Seth B","accountLink":"/user/id/977242295"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Think you're ready? You aren't. Trust me.\n\n10 years have been leading to this. Leading to sadness, to anger, to confusion. Leading to the gutsiest blockbuster of all time. It doesn't give you room to breathe, not even for a second, and the sheer amount of excitement it brings to the table is off the richter scale. I don't want to say much because it needs a second viewing immediately but one things for sure, Thanos lives up to the hype.\n\nFirst off, Thanos delivers. He truly is the big, bad guy he was promised to be and you will find that out fairly quickly. But what I truly like about him is they gave him a lot of depth. He has reasons for what he is doing and it isn't what you'd initially think. Josh Brolin is absolutely fantastic in the role and he's the best CGI villain since Gollum in the Lord Of The Rings films. Yep, you heard me.\n\nThe Russo Brothers need to be commended as they did as good a job as anybody could of getting all of these heroes enough screen time without it feeling like a \"oh hey there's hero x,\" a bunch of times. Each hero has a meaningful role, some more than others obviously, but the way they share the screentime is very well done. I'll admit, it can be a little jarring with so many storylines going on at once and having to jump from place to place but I managed to keep up just fine. I'd suggest being all caught up with the MCU before going into this one though as there is a bit to keep up with.\n\nThe action sequences are some of the best in the entire MCU. The Wakanda battle scene in particular is a highlight. The new teamups were very cool as well, but I won't spoil any of them. There is also a very cool return of a character, but I suggest avoiding looking that up as there is a big spoiler that happens not long after they return. Also every scene with Rocket/Thor, Strange/Stark and Thanos/Gamora is pure gold. This film does not disappoint and it rewards fans and audiences that have followed this impossible feat in cinematic history.\n\nSee it as soon as you can and feel the goosebumps elevate and remain there for 2 and half hours. This isn't just a 'comic book movie', it's a comic book EPIC! I'm strapped for words guys, it's definitely something.","displayName":"Matt Y","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/531015163/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T06:57:02.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T06:58:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"803487602","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt Y","accountLink":"/user/id/803487602"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Movie ever.....I was blown away by each and every second of the movie, I will be seeing it again for sure!!","displayName":"Jennifer T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1388577226/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T06:56:02.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T06:57:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"846731418","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jennifer T","accountLink":"/user/id/846731418"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
