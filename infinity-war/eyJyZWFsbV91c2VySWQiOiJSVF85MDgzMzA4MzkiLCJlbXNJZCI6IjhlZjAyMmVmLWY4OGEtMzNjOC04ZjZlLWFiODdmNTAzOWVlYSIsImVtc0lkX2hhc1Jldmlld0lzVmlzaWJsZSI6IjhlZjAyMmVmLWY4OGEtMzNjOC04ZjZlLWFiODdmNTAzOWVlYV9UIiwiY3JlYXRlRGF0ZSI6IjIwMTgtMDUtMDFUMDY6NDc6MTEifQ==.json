That this universe could have been created, maintained and ultimately brought to this moment has been a joy and revelation.  Thanos was the most plausible, most convincing, most scary bad guy since the Joker.  Quite simply, even though, so much happened and so many characters were involved, this was Thanos' story.  And this movie helped me finally understand and give a damn about Thor.  The pacing was perfect.  The characterization was perfect.  The battles were perfect.  The Russo brothers really know how to adapt comic book entities into a believable movie.  Of course, the gut punch at the end will alienate some fans.  But the reality is that if you were a True Believer, you would have clamored for the Snap as much as any other plot point in this enormous spectacle.  I've watched the movie twice and honestly can't wait for Avengers 4.  My one grouse is why Marvel didn't just say this was one half of a complete story.  And why they didn't just make it a five or six hour movie.  Because I could have kept watching this movie even after the credits ran through.  Heck, I've watched it twice already and will need to watch a third time.  And then maybe several times on 4K Blu-Ray (IMAX, baby).  The plot was emotional, gut-wrenching, entertaining and epic.  I can not wait for next year....and Captain Marvel.

As i said it will be big and they are propably gona switch to an another universe or going to bring them all back because how can you make a spider man sequel whitout having spider man in it or they are going to switch to miles morales that could be a option.\nBut I think that was a great and entertaining movie.\nBut they killed so many heroes that i loved that is why i am giving it a 4 out of 5","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1843441422622976/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T06:33:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T06:42:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"977252270","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977252270"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Without a doubt, one of the best super hero movies I've ever seen!

After CA:CW I could tell the Russo brothers were not the men for Avengers Infinity War. Here is why I didn't like the movie. Movie was ok. To long and there were some really boring parts. Story did not seem to be cohesive and the humor was meh. Also, it was very predictable. Wow, everyone gets vaporized except for the original Avengers, how convenient. From a technical standpoint the CGI was terrible. Thanos looked completely fake. He was also a very simple character with no real depth. Also kind of weak surprisingly. When Roadie and Bruce are in their Iron Man suits at the end with their helmets on they look like bobble heads or floating heads. I'd give it a 7 out of 10. It was a good try but the Russo brothers were not the right directors for this movie.","displayName":"grant g","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T06:22:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T06:25:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"974110156","realm":"RT","displayName":"grant g","accountLink":"/user/id/974110156"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I thought this was one of Marvel's best attempts thus far, big budget, stayed close to the comic books on many things, I took off one star for multple scenes such as shuri bruce chastizing bruce banner while operating on vision, and thought that Peter Quill punching Thanos to only awaken him was bad writing.","displayName":"Chuck M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T06:21:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T06:28:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"977252242","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chuck M","accountLink":"/user/id/977252242"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie with great pace.
