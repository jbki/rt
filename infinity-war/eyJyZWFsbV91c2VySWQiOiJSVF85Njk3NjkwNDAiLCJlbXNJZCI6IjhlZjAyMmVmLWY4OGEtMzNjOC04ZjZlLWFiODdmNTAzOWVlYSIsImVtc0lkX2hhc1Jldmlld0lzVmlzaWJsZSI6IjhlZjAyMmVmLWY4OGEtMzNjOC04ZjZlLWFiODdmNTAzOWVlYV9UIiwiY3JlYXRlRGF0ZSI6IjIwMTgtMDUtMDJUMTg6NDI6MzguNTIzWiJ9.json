Has engaging action scenes with fleshed out interactions between Marvel's many characters. Having all the characters is great although it falls flat with transitions. Too many characters and not enough time to get through all of them. Too many jokes as well. These aren't your classic Marvel jokes as some have made me laugh quite a bit. The CGI isn't the best but I don't take that into mind as it isn't too important for me. If you are easily impressed by CGI, don't go in expecting to be impressed. Are these things bad enough to ruin the movie? No, the movie still stands strong and leaves me wanting more.","displayName":"Lucas B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T18:06:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T18:12:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"977133250","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lucas B","accountLink":"/user/id/977133250"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"plot was weak and shitty.  killed off the most dynamic characters and ruined the others'.
