Yet, I still have the feeling that once I see the next Avengers film, I'm going to be in Nirvana. This was an incredible flick for any fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That said, if you haven't paid attention to the previous films, you will miss a layer of the joy of ten years of immersion in Marvel mythology.\n\nThe movie picks up right after the post-credit scene of Thor: Ragnorak, where the ship of Asgard's last remnants meets the ship of Thanos, the last Titan. Right from the start, you are on a thrill ride that does not stop till the very end. And the visuals of every scene are breathtaking. You barely get a moment to catch your breath before the next battle begins.\n \nThanos believes that the only way to save the universe from overpopulation is to kill half of it. The balance of nature must be restored and he is the only one with the moxie to do it. At times, he becomes a Shakespearean character, and one of the best superhero film villains we've gotten yet. This film is really his story and it's nice to see a villain with some depth.\n\nThat is not to say that most of our heroes do not have their moments, but they cannot help being individually underserved. There are simply too many of them for deep depth. Thor and Gamora have the most time devoted to them and it is well-deserved. There is much death and pathos during the two and a half hours of the film, but when you see the film you will understand why many of them do not have the intended effect.\n\nI really enjoyed this movie, but if you haven't seen the previous films, it is very much worth playing catchup before seeing it. And there is one post credit scene at the very end of the scroll, which is an important clue to the next Avengers film, which will come next year. And the last word in it perfectly encapsulates my feelings about the end of the movie.","displayName":"Jerry S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001383722813/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T17:21:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T17:21:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"954454808","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jerry S","accountLink":"/user/id/954454808"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Impressive and fun to watch","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2137049286525153/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T17:19:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T17:20:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243930","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977243930"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great Movie, but very heavy.","displayName":"Ian G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001153916235/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T17:18:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T17:19:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"967766609","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ian G","accountLink":"/user/id/967766609"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazingly epic experience!.Thank you marvel","displayName":"Patrick J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1048718968536192/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T17:16:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T17:20:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"974575841","realm":"RT","displayName":"Patrick J","accountLink":"/user/id/974575841"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"seen 2018. rewatchable ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T17:16:19.751Z","updateDate":"2018-06-02T05:16:07.107Z","user":{"userId":"967964555","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/967964555"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I cried...at the end or it could have been allergies.
