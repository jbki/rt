Very well done! Definitely lived up to the hype of the massive scope of this film, and every one of the extensive cast of characters had their moments to shine. Thanks in particular was the star of this movie, and that really made it all come together wonderfully.

If you are looking for emotional moments, depth of character, endless dialogue that makes you contemplate life and gets  you to feel self important and somewhat civilized and intellectual then you don't get it. You shoulden' have even gone to the theater. If you don't like cgi and fantasy  then don't go watch a marvel movie expecting something you would that Oscars.  Sit back with your pocorn  and your soda and forget about your life for two hours, to go on an epic ride with the Avengers. \nThis movie is for the fans, for the lovers of superhero's. You might have your favorite, but if you love Iron man, then you love the hulk, if you love the hulk then you love captain America  and on  and on.  On their own, they are good, they are great. But watching them together ups the ante. But what really ,really makes this movie though is Thanos. So evil, disturbed and powerful that you can't help but be in awe. From his gloomy entrance into every scene, his enormous ship, to his near unbeatable power, he never wavers or seems to be loosing.  Its that feeling of impending doom, that feeling of not being able to win that permeates the movie. The fear and hopelessness in Iron man's eyes, the hulk refusing to fight, Loki and Gamora easily killed and  dying without ever putting up a serious fight. Thanos is different foe. The ultimate foe.  And unlike any other superhero movie, There is no happy ending. Although the end does not bring the usual  satisfying feeling of justice being served and everything turning out to be alright, its exactly that realism, that real life aspect of things not always turning out alright that makes the movie so great and sets up so perfectly for a next installment. For the fans, this was an epic movie, and with so many great moments, one to watch over and over.   So far probably the best avengers movie yet.","displayName":"Frank N Tina F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-23T07:01:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-23T07:33:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"928678572","realm":"RT","displayName":"Frank N Tina F","accountLink":"/user/id/928678572"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 23, 2018"}]}
