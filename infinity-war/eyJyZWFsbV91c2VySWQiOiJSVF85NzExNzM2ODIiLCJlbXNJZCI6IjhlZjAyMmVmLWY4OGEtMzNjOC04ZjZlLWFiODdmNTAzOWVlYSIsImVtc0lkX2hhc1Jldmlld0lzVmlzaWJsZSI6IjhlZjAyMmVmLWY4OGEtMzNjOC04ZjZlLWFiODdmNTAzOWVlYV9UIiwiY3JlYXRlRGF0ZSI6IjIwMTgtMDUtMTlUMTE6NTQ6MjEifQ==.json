It is at least an hour longer than it needs to be. The characters are two dimensional and you wind up sympathising with the villain.

Avoid.","displayName":"Roger K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-19T11:11:14.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-19T14:28:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"977276741","realm":"RT","displayName":"Roger K","accountLink":"/user/id/977276741"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best comic book movie, ever.... hands down!

Been a fan of the series since the 1st Avengers movie. But was not fan of the 2015 movie Avengers: Age of Ultron as it was a regular charade of fighting of big bad villains.\n\nThis movie was quite different experience than its prequel. The big cast line up is amazing. Story was bit stretched in certain parts but at normal space mostly. Non-stop back to back plots keeps the interest in the movie.\n\nFate of most characters don't look good but the sequel will reveal the what really happened to them. :P Overall a good action movie for this summer.","displayName":"Harshith J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/548919364/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-19T10:05:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-19T10:06:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"886530366","realm":"RT","displayName":"Harshith J","accountLink":"/user/id/886530366"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's a challenge I feel to have a movie with so many stars and still pull off a somewhat decent movie.. but somehow Disney and marvel pulled it off.
