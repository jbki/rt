One thing I was sceptically of is the amount of characters. But Marvel really did a great job in making a movie, with around 35 main characters, without making it feel like they overstuffed it.\n\nThe actors all played very well. The Visual effects are simply amazing, with Infinity War also being the first movie shot entirely with IMAX cameras. The Black Order are all a mix of CGI and motion capturing, done by stunt doubles and voice actors. While Thanos was created per motion capture and face tracking by actor Josh Brolin himself.\n\nProbably the only negative things about the movie are:\nYou can't watch the movie, if you haven't seen most of the other MCU films, but that is one reason, that makes the movie so great (because you have built up a bond to the characters over the years.).\nAnd the other thing is, there is no action strand. The story feels like 4 various actions, happening at the same time but aren't really connected.\n\nBut apart from that it is a great movie and especially for Marvel fans it's just awesome.","displayName":"Noah H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T01:09:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T00:58:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"977090118","realm":"RT","displayName":"Noah H","accountLink":"/user/id/977090118"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"You have never seen something like this before and you would never see something like this again in your lifetime.
