In conclusion Infinity war is one of the best if not best mcu movie to ever date really looking forward to seeing avengers 4.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2157005194573292/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-16T04:51:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-16T05:06:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"977547346","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977547346"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Must see even if you haven't watched the other MCU films.

Each character gets a time to shine and dialogue that fits them well. If you haven't seen all of the other movies leading up to this I think most of it will still make perfect sense, but you'll miss some quips and inside jokes. Also, be aware that while this film is mostly fun there are some much darker moments, including a torture scene. All in all, though, the film is certainly worth the hype.","displayName":"Christian B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-15T11:47:28.000Z","updateDate":"2019-08-23T01:27:15.214Z","user":{"userId":"977547201","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christian B","accountLink":"/user/id/977547201"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A perfect second climax to the MCU that brings all of the characters that we've come to love together.","displayName":"Patrick I","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-15T09:37:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-15T09:38:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"977514579","realm":"RT","displayName":"Patrick I","accountLink":"/user/id/977514579"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love the way they introduced Thanos and gamora.
