Pero... Es demasiado sencillo quitarle el guantelete del infinito a Thanos, Dr Strange pudo haberselo quitado con uno de los portales, si peter queel o Starlord no hubiera interferido le habrian quitado a Thanos el guantelete sin problema. Aun teniendo sus erroes debo admititr que la pelicula me encanto.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/715629265461928/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-14T16:03:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-14T16:03:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"977545239","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977545239"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I have seen this movie at least a dozen times now, and  I still enjoy it! I have had very few experiences in a theater like I had when I saw Infinity War. The humor, the action, the hoping the heroes would win but knowing they wouldn't, and the utter shock at the level of loss at the end. I know some think this was just a cash-grab, maybe it was, but in the end it was a cause I still would give my money to!","displayName":"Marshal T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-13T21:24:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-13T21:28:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"977543094","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marshal T","accountLink":"/user/id/977543094"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Definitely the best movie of the MCU, don't care what the critics say.

They are gonna bring all the characters back. Even before when we got the Guardian of the Galaxy three and Spider-Man Far From Home confirmation. Would have to recommend it to anyone who has seen the last films also wasn't too gory. The acting was very good and Josh Brolin was a very good choice. Also, he was a good CGI actor. The soundtrack was incredible and added a lot in scenes. The way they used the infinity stones was unimaginable. Luckily we got to see what the reality stone was capable off since we didn't get anything from Thor: Dark World. Thanos was probably the best CGI thing I have ever seen. I was very surprised with the twist of Red Skull is alive the whole time since Captain America: The First Avengers.\n\nWe have definitely seen the Russo Brothers work with more than two superheroes, but it was interesting to see them use more than two villains. And it was a great choice to use the order, well that's what I believe its called. Also its the biggest combination of superheroes in a film. CGI was extremely good and the detail with the gauntlet was incredible. Especially since there are many uses for it. One of the biggest flaws is that there are too many ways to stop Thanos, they may have said that there was only one way, but that was just there to stop fans from saying \"it was so easy to defeat him\". Josh Brolin did a great job.\n\nOverall I won't be surprised if the film gets an award for visual effects in the Oscars. I loved to see all the characters go full out with their abilities. I enjoyed the female Avengers teaming up. The big army in the film was quite spooky.","displayName":"Ivan J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-13T07:05:47.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-08T15:33:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"977536995","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ivan J","accountLink":"/user/id/977536995"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Complete success.
