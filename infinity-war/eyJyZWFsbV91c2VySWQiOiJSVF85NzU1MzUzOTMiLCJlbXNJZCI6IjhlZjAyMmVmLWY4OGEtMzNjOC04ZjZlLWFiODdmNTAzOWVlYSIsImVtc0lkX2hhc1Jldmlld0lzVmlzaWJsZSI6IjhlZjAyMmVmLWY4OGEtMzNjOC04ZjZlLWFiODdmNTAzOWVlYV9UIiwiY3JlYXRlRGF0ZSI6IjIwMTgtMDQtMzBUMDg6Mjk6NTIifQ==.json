During the 2:30+ hours of Infinity War, I found myself alternating from sitting on the edge of my theatre seat, giggling, smiling from ear to ear, having my hands on my mouth in shock and awe to crying uncontrollably like a child. Perhaps having watched the whole MCU in order for the past month has made the experience more intense and the stakes higher, but that is undoubtedly the genius that is Marvel. The movie ended at 3pm and we talked about it until it was time to go to bed. We will probably go see it again this week.","displayName":"LuLu V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/884030061/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T08:14:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T08:22:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"806623549","realm":"RT","displayName":"LuLu V","accountLink":"/user/id/806623549"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The tone is set from the start, and each scene offers meaningful action until its bold climax.

After 'Black Panther', I felt like Marvel was growing stale. However, Avengers: Infinity War just injected the fun back into the franchise.
