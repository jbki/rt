With 160 minutes of jaw-dropping action and a wide range of remarkable superheroes, what more would you want? However, the most iconic character of the movie is Thanos. Thanos is the main villain of the movie and is willing to do anything to collect all 6 infinity stones. Thanos brings out the hopeless and more emotional side of the Avengers. The characters are still comedic and determined at times, but as it reaches the end of the movie, that changes. Thanos' children (Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian and Corvus Glaive) also play a major role in this movie. They are insistent of helping their father collect the infinity stones. There are so many breath-taking plot twists in this film, especially the one at the end (no spoilers!!). If you haven't already seen Infinity War than I highly suggest you watch it as soon as possible, it is the best, if not one of the best, Marvel Cinematic Universe films ever. However, nothing can prepare you for this spectacular, game-changing movie.","displayName":"Jay G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T01:27:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T01:59:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241555","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jay G","accountLink":"/user/id/977241555"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I'm still processing the film but I can say there were great parts but also some really stupid parts.
