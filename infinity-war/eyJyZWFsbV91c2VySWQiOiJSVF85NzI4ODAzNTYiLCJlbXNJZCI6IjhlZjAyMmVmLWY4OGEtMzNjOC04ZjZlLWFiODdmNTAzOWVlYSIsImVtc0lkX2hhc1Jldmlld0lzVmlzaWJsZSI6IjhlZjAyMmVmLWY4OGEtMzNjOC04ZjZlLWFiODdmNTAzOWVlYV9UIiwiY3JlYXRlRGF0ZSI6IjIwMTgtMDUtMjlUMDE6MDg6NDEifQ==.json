It might be a little confusing if you haven't seen most of the Marvel movies leading up to this one, but the funny moments, great action, and excellent character moments should still translate through.  Definitely worth seeing on the big screen.

Josh Brolin as Thanos shines in a role expanded upon in three minor appearances with no slowing for an unneeded introduction as well as a tragic backstory and inspired acting. The usual with the actors, all doing their best to hold up this spectacular movie. The new guys in the film all do pretty well, with the four side villains all threatening despite no character development. The two others (no spoilers) are exciting in what they may provide for upcoming films, with the possibilities ever expanding. The main flaws in this film come from a lack of screen time for some characters who really needed it and too much focus on those who didn't. Also, no Hawkeye or Ant-Man. So, watch this film and get excited for what Avengers 4 may bring. In the end, this is the second best Avengers film, second best Guardians film, second best Spider-Man Film, third best Thor film, and best Thanos film we may ever get.","displayName":"Joseph R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-28T20:49:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-28T20:55:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"977296075","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph R","accountLink":"/user/id/977296075"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best avengers movie yet","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-28T20:02:15.313Z","updateDate":"2018-05-28T20:02:15.313Z","user":{"userId":"260140242","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260140242"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 28, 2018"}]}
