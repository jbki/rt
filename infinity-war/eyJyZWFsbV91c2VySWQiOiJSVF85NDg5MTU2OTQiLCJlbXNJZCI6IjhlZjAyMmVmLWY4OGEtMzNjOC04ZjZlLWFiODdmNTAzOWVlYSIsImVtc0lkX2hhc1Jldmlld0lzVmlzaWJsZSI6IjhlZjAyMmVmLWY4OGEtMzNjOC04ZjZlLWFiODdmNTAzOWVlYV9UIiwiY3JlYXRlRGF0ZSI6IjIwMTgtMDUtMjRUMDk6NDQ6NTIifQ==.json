Still, the pace moves along pretty quickly and balances multiple story lines well up to what might be the most comicbook-y ending in all of comic book movies. And add Thanos to the short list of Best Marvel Movie Villains. Note: If you're not caught up with Marvel's Cinematic Universe, I recommend doing so before watching Infinity Gauntlet (you can probably leave Ant-Man out this time around).","displayName":"Erin S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-24T08:02:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-24T08:03:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"947315194","realm":"RT","displayName":"Erin S","accountLink":"/user/id/947315194"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Hulk and vision did terrible","displayName":"Quran%20 E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-24T07:17:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-22T09:38:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"977283838","realm":"RT","displayName":"Quran%20 E","accountLink":"/user/id/977283838"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"A little long but enjoyable.","displayName":"R P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-24T06:47:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-24T06:47:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"977286134","realm":"RT","displayName":"R P","accountLink":"/user/id/977286134"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best Marvel movies to date!
