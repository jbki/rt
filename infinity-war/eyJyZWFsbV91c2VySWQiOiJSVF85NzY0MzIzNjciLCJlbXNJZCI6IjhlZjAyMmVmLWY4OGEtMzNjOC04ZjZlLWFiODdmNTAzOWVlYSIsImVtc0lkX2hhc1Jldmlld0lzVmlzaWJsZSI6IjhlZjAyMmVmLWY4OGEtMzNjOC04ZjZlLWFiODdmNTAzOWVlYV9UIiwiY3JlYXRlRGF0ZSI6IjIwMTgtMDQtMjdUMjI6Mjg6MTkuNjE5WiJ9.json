They are right. Avengers: Infinity War, preys on the emotions of their fans to ensure that fans will see the next movie. The ending has no plot significance and only serves to provide shock value to the movie. If you want depression, this movie is for you. Writers missed big and left fans disappointed (my whole movie theater left complaining) Did have a few good action scenes, but nothing especially new. I'd say the redeeming quality of this movie is the personality characters exhibit, but even this can't detract from blatant disregard for all the good framework for fiction. 1/10 don't watch ????","displayName":"Logan T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T22:20:00.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T22:32:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"977244613","realm":"RT","displayName":"Logan T","accountLink":"/user/id/977244613"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is the best marvel movie.

This is a really easy, lazy cheap shot to take because they obviously aren't aiming for high art status. Marvel balances the tone so masterfully that it's easy not to notice how amazing all of the acting is, or how well-written the scripts are.\n\nMarvel doesn't spit in the face of the idea of fan-service, like the Last Jedi did, nor are they absolute slaves to it.\n\nAlmost any movie in this franchise puts to shame nearly every superhero movie ever made by another studio.\n\nThe X-Men movies are certainly cool and fun, but most of them take themselves way too seriously,  and even the good ones are all plagued by distractingly uneven acting quality.\n\nI have a feeling that as The Avengers were not prepared to face Thanos,  audiences will not be prepared for just how good the sequel to this is going to be. \n\n I see a lot of critics saying that this is the film everything was building to, but look at the timeline, this film is another awesome stepping stone like Civil War, Avengers 4 is really what all of this has been building to.  And I, for one, simply cannot wait. And this is coming from a Fellini fanboy.","displayName":"Tim K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/78000660/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T22:16:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T22:31:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"806209083","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tim K","accountLink":"/user/id/806209083"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best marvel movie ever","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T22:16:32.797Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T22:16:32.797Z","user":{"userId":"967368381","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/967368381"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
