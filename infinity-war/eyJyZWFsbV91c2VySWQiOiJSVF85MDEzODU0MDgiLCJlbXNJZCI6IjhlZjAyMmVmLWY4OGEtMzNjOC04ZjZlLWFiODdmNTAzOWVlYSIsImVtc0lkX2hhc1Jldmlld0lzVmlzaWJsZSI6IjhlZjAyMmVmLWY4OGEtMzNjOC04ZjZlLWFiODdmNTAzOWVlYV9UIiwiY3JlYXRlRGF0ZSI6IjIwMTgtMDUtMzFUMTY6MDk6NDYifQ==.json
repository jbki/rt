Hardly a month goes by without another hitting the big screen. Whilst visually these movies are great what they do lack is adequate comprehensible screenplay. Infinity War is one that just seems to amble on despite a week storyline. Messy from the start and never really amounts to much at all. It's a movie that thinks it is bigger than it is.","displayName":"Mark W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-31T14:29:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-31T14:33:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977300481","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark W","accountLink":"/user/id/977300481"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 31, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolute, utter perfection for a comic book movie.

It has more in common with Age of Ultron than say, Civil War, in the sense that it feels over-stuffed and a little heavy-handed, but unlike the former, it manages to push the characters and stories into interesting new directions. Thanos is probably the best villain the MCU has ever had (Loki is the other contender, though he's now pretty much a good guy...or is he?). One could complain that the main Avengers like Captain America take too much of a backseat to the other characters like the Guardians, but I imagine we'll see more of him in the next film. It's also impressive when you step back and realize how far these characters have come since their debuts, when their battles seemed much smaller in scale, more grounded and less apocalyptic. Bigger isn't always better, but Disney/Marvel deserve credit for crafting a long, complicated web and making it a blast for the audience. As usual, take note, DC. This isn't even the best Avengers movie, and it's still more exciting and emotionally resonant than Justice League and Batman vs. Superman combined.","displayName":"Jon-Luc A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/174998719671042/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-31T13:03:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-31T13:14:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"976113982","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jon-Luc A","accountLink":"/user/id/976113982"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 31, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"perfect balance of fun and superhero","displayName":"mario b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-31T11:49:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-31T11:49:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"977300376","realm":"RT","displayName":"mario b","accountLink":"/user/id/977300376"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 31, 2018"}]}
