But who cares about Mantis anyway? Josh Brolin as Thanos is the films biggest highlight though. Despite being the villain, he's the central character to the film and is written in such a way that despite being a genocidal maniac, it's hard not to see where he's coming from. Brolin really is excellent in the role and is not only the best MCU villain, he's one of the best villains in a comic book movie rivalling Heath Ledger as the Joker.\n\nThere are a few places in the middle of the film that do drag a little bit but they are few and far between. It's also fair to say that anyone not invested in the MCU will probably feel lost at times. But for any Marvel fan or someone who just enjoys high stake action films, Infinity War is an essential watch.","displayName":"David B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-15T04:47:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-15T05:50:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"976225898","realm":"RT","displayName":"David B","accountLink":"/user/id/976225898"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"the most stupid superhero movie I have ever seen, but still fun to watch.","displayName":"Naranek K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-14T18:01:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-14T18:03:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"909074375","realm":"RT","displayName":"Naranek K","accountLink":"/user/id/909074375"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best marvel movie to date ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-14T17:46:15.851Z","updateDate":"2018-09-14T17:46:15.851Z","user":{"userId":"976430304","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976430304"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"this is the culmination of everything in this universe for the past ten years","displayName":"Calvino W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-14T11:31:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-14T11:32:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"977474566","realm":"RT","displayName":"Calvino W","accountLink":"/user/id/977474566"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Incredible.

There are probably less than :60 seconds of real (not CGI) scenery in the entire movie, and it is very noticeable. The plot is like every scene from CSI: Miami. Thanos is animated like Roger Rabbit in the real world. Pros: I enjoyed seeing Guardians show up, and the new Spiderman.","displayName":"Pat B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-13T23:27:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-13T23:30:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"977473705","realm":"RT","displayName":"Pat B","accountLink":"/user/id/977473705"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 13, 2018"}]}
