A lot of the players in this movie were done out of character. Over all, all of Thors fight scenes and general banter were funny. Gremora was well done for most of the movie. Loved Thonas, but thought his reasoning for killing half the universe was unbelievably dumb. Population control...thats it. As if in 10 years the population wouldnt just double up again. (As it has repeatedly on earth in recent decades). They got everything wrong about the Hulk that you could possible mess up. The hulk was scared the entire movie of dudes that Ironman in his normal suit could wipe the floor with...??? I just dont understand the thought process on that decision. And the actor could not get half his lines out without laughing, as if he just didnt care. Dr. Strange was great in the fight scenes, but just dumb when it came to the lines they gave him and his decisions. Handing over the time stone... just wrong for the character from every point of view. The Guardians of the Galaxy where just portrayed as complete idiot with absolutely no control over any of their actions or emotions. Spidy was ok, but some of his joke were flat, others were funny. Capt America, Blavk Widow, and Bucky were great, but little scene time. I feel if they had gotten more time they would have messed them up too. Black Panther was there too, had no point other than Wakonda. The Wakonda fight was a joke,  the city force shield can stop obital bombardments all day apparently, but scratches from a bunch of oversized sand flees can get you right through. I could go on and on about how earth's smartest heros must have been smoking crack or something before the fights, but all in all it was ok. Very pretty backgrounds and cgi was good.","displayName":"John T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T07:51:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T08:13:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"977222700","realm":"RT","displayName":"John T","accountLink":"/user/id/977222700"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A fantastic union of the Marvel Cinematic Universe thus far, and a great prologue to the final act.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T07:50:55.001Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T07:50:55.001Z","user":{"userId":"800035014","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/800035014"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Infinity War sucede no que promete.

Y ellos mismos fueron los que nombraron la Liga de la justicia como la mejor película (haters de marvel) para todos aquellos que vieron las 18 peliculas saben de que esta es la mejor película y en verdad no tiene ninguna queja (únicamente la orden oscura)  pero de ahi en mas no tiene nada malo. \nPelícula 100%,  recomendable para todos aquellos que hayan visto todas las peliculas del MCU.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/657362927928453/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T07:38:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T07:58:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248221","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977248221"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"}]}
