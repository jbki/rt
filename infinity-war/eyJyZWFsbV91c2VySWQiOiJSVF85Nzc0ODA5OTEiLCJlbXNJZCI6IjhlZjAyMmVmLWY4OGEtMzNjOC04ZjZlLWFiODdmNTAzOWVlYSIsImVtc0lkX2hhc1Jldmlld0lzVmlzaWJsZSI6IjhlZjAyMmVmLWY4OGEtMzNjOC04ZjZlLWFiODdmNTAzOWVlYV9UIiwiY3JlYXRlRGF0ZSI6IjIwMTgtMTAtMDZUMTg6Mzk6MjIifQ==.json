For the first 90 minutes it pulls it off. However i was bored in the last 60 minutes.\n\nIt's very funny, and many of the characters are on good form. Thanos is an intimidating villain, cunning and cruel. But like so often with Marvel he does come up short. And blink and you'll miss Black Panther, bar the fantastic Wakanda battle, \n\nEveryone floats away at the end, and it will do likewise in my memory.","displayName":"Kevin C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10155568448416112/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-06T08:21:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-06T08:32:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"976230397","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kevin C","accountLink":"/user/id/976230397"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This IS the event.

But, overall, the film feels bland, and the storytelling lacks motivation. \n\nI rarely find myself compelled by the plastic, plot-driven characters on display. Seriously, for the epic scale this film asserts, the stakes may be high, but if there's no emotion or soul going into its story, why should I care what happens? At this point, I've kind of lost interest in the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. I've felt this way many times before, and I was caught by surprise with Homecoming and Ragnarok last year, but maybe I just find them more enjoyable and satisfying to watch than the darker or more \"politically complex\" films (think The Winter Soldier and Civil War), which appears to be what Infinity War aims for. Although it's not always a bad thing to put heroes at stake at the hands of a strong Marvel villain, it fails to be intriguing. And, I know it's not just my having a problem with more serious matters (I love The Dark Knight); Marvel succeeds when it takes a hold of the fact that it's just a movie, and it can't half expect its audience to take everything seriously. Just look at the overwrought technology and downright complexity of its universe, which may fascinate some but only bores me. \n\nAll in all, Infinity War is one of Marvel's most ambitious feats but is still nothing short of a disappointment.","displayName":"Oliver W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100006455625320/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-06T01:31:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-06T01:31:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"955500286","realm":"RT","displayName":"Oliver W","accountLink":"/user/id/955500286"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best MCU film I have watched","displayName":"Reydavid%20 M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-05T17:06:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-05T17:07:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"977384743","realm":"RT","displayName":"Reydavid%20 M","accountLink":"/user/id/977384743"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It was decent don't understand the hype in fact I think the hype and the spoiler for spiderman's death ruined.
