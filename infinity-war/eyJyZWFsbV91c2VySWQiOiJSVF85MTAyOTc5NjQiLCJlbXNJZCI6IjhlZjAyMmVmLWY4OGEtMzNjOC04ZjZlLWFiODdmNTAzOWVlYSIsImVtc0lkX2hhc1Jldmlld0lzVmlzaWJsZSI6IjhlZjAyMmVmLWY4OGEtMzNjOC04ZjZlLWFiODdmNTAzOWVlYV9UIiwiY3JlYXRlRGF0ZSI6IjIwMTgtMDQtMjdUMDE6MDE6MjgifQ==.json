Josh Brolin portrays Thanos in my opinion on par with Ledgers Joker if not better than. This isn't an avengers it is Thanos part 1. My only problem with the film and it's a huge misstep is the confirmed up coming projects from marvel, ruin the sequel for this as it's sort of telling us the outcome of Thanos story and because of this I'm worried they are going to go in the wrong direction with avengers 4.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1942965205725503/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T00:55:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T01:04:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241494","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977241494"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Exceeded every expectation, every emotion... mind blown!!!!!!!","displayName":"Nic D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T00:54:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T00:59:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241492","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nic D","accountLink":"/user/id/977241492"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's a great film only because of the 18 films leading to it. You have to know the MCU before you watch this or you'll be lost and rather confused.

Pros: Narration from Thanos point of view. Choreography: AMAZING! Cons: Thanos is boring. There were references about Thanos nickname but it didn't even make sense bc he didn't even match the comic book Thanos. Freaking SMILE!!!  you can't use Thanos' nickname if he isn't smiling!  What is this a Zack Snyder movie?  jk...it's better ...but I digress   There are two types of MCU movies:  Individual and Synergistic.  This is the best out of the Synergistic along with Captain America 2 & 3; and Avengers 1.","displayName":"Reggie Y","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/25409974/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T00:52:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T00:59:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"784664157","realm":"RT","displayName":"Reggie Y","accountLink":"/user/id/784664157"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was jaw droppingly awesome.
