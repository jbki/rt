It truly delivers that. While many newcomers complain about the confusion of characters that have no context to, even though they're starting with the 18th film in a universe-based franchise, Many Marvel fanatics such as myself, watch this film in awe as it fulfills character match ups and fight sequences that we've dreamed of since 2008.
