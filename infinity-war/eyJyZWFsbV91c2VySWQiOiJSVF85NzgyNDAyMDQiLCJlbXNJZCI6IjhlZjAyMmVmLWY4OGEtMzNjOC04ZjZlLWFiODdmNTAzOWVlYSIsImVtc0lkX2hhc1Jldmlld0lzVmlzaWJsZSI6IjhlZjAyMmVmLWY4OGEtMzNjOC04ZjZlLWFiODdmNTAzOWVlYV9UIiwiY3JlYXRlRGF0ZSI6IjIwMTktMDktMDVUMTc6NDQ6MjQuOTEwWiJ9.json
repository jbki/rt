Now I have seen the endgame and I do not like the second verse of this story but this was the best setup ever to fail in the follow up with.  This movie has everything you could want.  Drama, action, good writing, incredible Cgi which is EVERYWHERE I mean soon they will not even NEED actors.  This will be the last good movie Marvel makes for a while I do believe.  Watch this and skip the endgame just stop here.  It is good enough right there.

The production of Kevin Feige is very awesome, the cast is amazing Robert Downey Jr. Scarlett Johansson, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, and more stars. The job of Russo brothers is nominated in the oscars to win  a movie with the best special effects and this is one of the highets grossing movie ever. In this piece of art, the avengers try to prevent Thanos from obtaining the powerful gems of Infinity. This movie all time have the specter centred in the history, from the beginning, your full attention catches you, until the last post-credit scene. 10 years to stay here! Is the climax of infinity saga! Ten years of MCU retrated in one movie! Is the empire strikes back of super hero movies. This piece of art leaves you wanting more. In my opinion this is the best movie ever.","displayName":"Jos M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-05T15:46:08.446Z","updateDate":"2019-09-05T15:46:08.446Z","user":{"userId":"978239792","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jos M","accountLink":"/user/id/978239792"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Thanos is probably the best villain, right next to Loki in the MCU. He was so believable, and they made his motivations better than his comicbook counterpart. Although I think the plot is kind of overrated it still is slightly above the plot we see in Endgame. The character moments and action make this a worthwhile action movie to see even if you don't like comicbooks.","displayName":" Night P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-05T06:12:54.063Z","updateDate":"2019-09-05T06:12:54.063Z","user":{"userId":"978238314","realm":"RT","displayName":" Night P","accountLink":"/user/id/978238314"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"awesome special effects and fight/action sequences, not to keen on the story but you can't expect too much from marvel films ","displayName":"charlie s","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-04T22:11:33.014Z","updateDate":"2019-09-04T22:11:33.014Z","user":{"userId":"978233245","realm":"RT","displayName":"charlie s","accountLink":"/user/id/978233245"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I Loved this movie.

Thanos will go down as one of the most iconic villains in film history and the way the Russo Brothers have juggled so many characters in a single movie is mind blowing! The only down side to the movie is probably the pacing. There arent any brakes on the tension so dont expect any slow moments...
