Not only does the film deliver on its heroes, but it also introduces the greatest villain in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. Thanos is really the main character in this film, and his motivations are clearly established. The struggles and consequences that he goes through are also apparent and clearly defined. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is one of the greatest MCU films of all time, and one of the greatest superhero films of all time.","displayName":"Sammy L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-24T16:27:41.481Z","updateDate":"2019-08-24T16:27:41.481Z","user":{"userId":"976315681","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sammy L","accountLink":"/user/id/976315681"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Not as good as endgame but still awesome ","displayName":"Rahul P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-24T08:19:48.328Z","updateDate":"2019-08-24T08:20:12.645Z","user":{"userId":"978185674","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rahul P","accountLink":"/user/id/978185674"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I really enjoyed this one!

The gathering together of such a huge amount of big names is worth the watch in itself. Josh Brolin (Thanos) and Dave Bautista (Drax) shine in particular, whilst Peter Dinklage's character is an epic fail. On an important side-note, Spider-Man's (Tom Holland's) hair is thoroughly magnificent.
