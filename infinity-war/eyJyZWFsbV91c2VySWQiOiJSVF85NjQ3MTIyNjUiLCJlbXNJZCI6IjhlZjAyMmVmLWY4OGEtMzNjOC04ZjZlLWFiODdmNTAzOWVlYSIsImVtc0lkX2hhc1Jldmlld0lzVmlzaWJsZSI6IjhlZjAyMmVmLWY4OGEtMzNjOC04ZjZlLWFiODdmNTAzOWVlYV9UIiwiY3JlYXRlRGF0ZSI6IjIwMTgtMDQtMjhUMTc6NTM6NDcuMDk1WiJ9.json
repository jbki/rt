Thinking about it, it confuses me that that the writers didn't realize what this movie was doing terribly wrong. But its amazing on what they did right. It was worth the wait though. Its satisfying to watch this movie. The movie was originally gonna have a part 2, but that has been changed to a new subtitle they haven't announced yet. (so basically the same thing) Since this movie is one of the last in the MCU. (marvel cinematic universe) Its the movie that's getting ready to give an ending to the MCU. Leaving room for a couple more movies (including the last avengers movie) And its just so satisfying seeing all of these characters that have been separate for so long come together. there's about 60 contributing characters in this movie. Its mindblowing. But the movie has its pros and cons.\n\nFirst of, i want to list of some of the good things in this movie. This movie makes so much sense. It makes all of the heros meeting together. It isn't so forced. It has explanations and it doesn't hesitate to surprise the viewers on when characters will show up. its perfect. The movie has amazing SFX too. i was blown away.\nThe movie has a great (but slightly confusing) plot. the movie manages to have everything connected. Thanoes is such a great villain. And you know so when you connect with the characters who hate him. He's a villain that you WANT to see stopped. You aren't just entertained. This movie felt shorter then it should have. and thats because it was so good!\n\nBut of course, it has its cons. It doesn't pay attention to some of the most popular characters! Spider Man, Black Panther, Thor, Captain America, and Hulk don't get enough attention! Especially Hulk and Captain, they don't have their unique traits. Hulk just has a big iron man suit! Even though the cover art has the REAL HULK THERE! BUT WE NEVER SEE HIM! I don't get it. Black panther  gets like 15 to 20 minutes of screen time! And he just fights! I mean, fighting is cool, but there was no character development! My other problem is that the cliff hanger. I love it, but i hope these characters comeback, or at least we get a good and satisfying explanation in the final avengers movie. Because Spider man homecoming 2 and 3 were announced, and black panther is getting a sequal, and both of them die! But i guess i can't really complain. A cliff hanger is supposed to do this. I just think this movie did it the wrong way.\n\nOverall, This movie is a great movie, with its flaws, it still is an action packed movie, and for the most part is satisfying. Leaving many possibilities for the final movie. 4/5","displayName":"Tom W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T17:42:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T18:29:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246885","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tom W","accountLink":"/user/id/977246885"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What a ride!
