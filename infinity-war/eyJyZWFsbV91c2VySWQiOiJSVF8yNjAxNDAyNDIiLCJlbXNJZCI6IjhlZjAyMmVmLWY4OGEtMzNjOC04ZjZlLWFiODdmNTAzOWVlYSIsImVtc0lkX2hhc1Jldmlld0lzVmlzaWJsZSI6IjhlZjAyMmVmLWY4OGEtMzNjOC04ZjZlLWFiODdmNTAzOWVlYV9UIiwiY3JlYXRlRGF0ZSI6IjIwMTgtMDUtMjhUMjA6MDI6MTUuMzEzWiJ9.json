Very well done. \nMy beef with the movie, or maybe with Disney I suppose, is that it seems obvious that nobody is really going to be allowed to die. They could have killed off just one of the characters in a convincing way. Maybe one that we don't need to see again (Cap, Bucky, Ironman..). It was clear though that they just aren't willing to let ANY of them go. To me, it just makes the threat and the plot less convincing. It makes any scene where we actually see someone die feel.. less real. \nI mean really Loki is a god. Heimdall is up there also so there is some chance he could return. We know Gomorrah is going to come back.  And all of those that disappeared obviously will be back. \nHell they couldn't even let Thor be down one eye for a whole movie. \nThe challenges just seem less convincing when you set things up for everyone to get resurrected at the end. Vision I'm sure they will drop the mind stone back in him and he will be fine. \nThen what is it with these guys being so unwilling to let just one team member die to save the whole damn universe. Thanks Dr Strange. Bang up job.\nAnd Tony Stark didn't even argue. He was like yeah ok give him the stone so I can live. What??  \nKill Vision. Vision deserves to die. So does Scarlet Witch. They are OP and should have been on the very top of the permakill list. \nI'm sure this isn't a popular opinion but it just feels like Disney is just so afraid to write anyone off at all, and that diminishes the feeling in the movie for me.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10210904980166600/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-28T18:00:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-28T18:26:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"976997499","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976997499"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best marvel film so far!
