It is customary to look at such divided projects in full perspective and to analyze backward, but here Marvell's decision to separate them allows them to exist as individuals. As such, \"Infinity War\" is, without doubt, the most impressive, sophisticated, complex and sweeping film ever seen since Marvel's heroes entered our lives, and his place in the top of the universe is guaranteed. It is a complex, moving and surprising work, one that combines tragedy and humor and makes up a huge, complete cinematic experience that is a cinematic experience.","displayName":"Ido D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2375960872466330/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-06-22T16:28:30.312Z","updateDate":"2019-06-29T15:37:31.294Z","user":{"userId":"978037480","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ido D","accountLink":"/user/id/978037480"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Action packed.fun.well written.
