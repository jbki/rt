Despite featuring over 20 characters in 2.5 hours, the Russo brothers are able to tell a story that contains a surprising amount of maturity and nuance (for a Marvel superhero movie). That being said, the movie does expect the audience to have kept up with the main events of the MCU and to enter the theater already invested in the characters and their story arcs. \n\nThe action scenes are plot-driven and purposeful. At no point will the audience ask, \"Why are they fighting again?\" as has been the case with some other recent superhero films. The action was fantastic, in the literal sense of the word. For some viewers (like myself), the reliance on CGI may render the action scenes less impactful. Consequently, there is nothing in this movie that will equal the highway knife fight or the elevator fight scenes from Winter Soldier. \n\nThe fresh character interactions are what make the movie truly enjoyable. Several characters are only given a handful of lines in the movie but the writing and delivery make their presence felt. Tom Holland, in particular, makes excellent use of his screen time.\n\nThe irony is, that in a movie that captures the Avengers at the 11th hour, too many of the critical moments of the film are rushed. Moreover, some of the inevitable send offs may not have the emotional impact you would expect.","displayName":"Peter W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T00:44:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T01:22:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"909082144","realm":"RT","displayName":"Peter W","accountLink":"/user/id/909082144"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"}]}
