This is the standard for every superhero film to be graded upon. Aside from a few small missteps, it delivers on every end. The stakes are real but we still have the signature Marvel humor entrenched in the narrative. It never goes overboard but it keeps the darkness in check.

It is the Empire Stikes Back of this generation on a granduer scale. However, with that said, that is all this movie is. You will have trouble following this movie of you haven't seen most of the others and rather than feeling like a masterpiece built up over years it will feel like a movie that is missing a beginning and an ending. Personally it was everything I could have asked within the context of the other movies. Honestly this all would have made a great showtime or HBO series.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T02:47:10.148Z","updateDate":"2018-05-08T02:47:10.148Z","user":{"userId":"913526434","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/913526434"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"}]}
