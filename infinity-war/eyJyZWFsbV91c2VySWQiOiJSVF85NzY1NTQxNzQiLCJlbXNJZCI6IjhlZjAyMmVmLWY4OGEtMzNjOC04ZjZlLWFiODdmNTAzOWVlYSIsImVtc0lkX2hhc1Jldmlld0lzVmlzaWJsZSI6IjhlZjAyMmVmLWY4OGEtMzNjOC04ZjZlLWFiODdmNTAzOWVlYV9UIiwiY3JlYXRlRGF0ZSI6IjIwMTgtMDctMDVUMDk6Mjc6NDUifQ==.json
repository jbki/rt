In its favour are an incredible cast, that trademark MCU humour and some stunning action sequences but these are offset by an infuriating ending and a lack of emotional heft to the film's inevitable darker moments.

Now what this does is that instead of saying that thanos is the bad guy because he's the bad guy, it gives him an actual arguable reason thats somewhat understandable to be a justification. The movie also took a lot of risks in killing off certain characters that would definitly be fan favorite like spiderman and Black panther. Speaking of black panther, I am glad that the twins decided not to shove any social politics down our throat in this movie as while it can be an ok tool, its used way to many times today and when used, its usually in a way that hurts rather than helping the story.\nMusic\nThe music in this was probably the best part of this movie as for the entire two and a half hours, its orchestra played perfect music that lined up perfectly with the movie. And Orchestral soundtracks can always help any medium. If you don't believe me then I would like to move your attention to the mario galaxy games, where its orchestral sound track created amazing and beautiful works. so for this to be incorporated into a full movie is amazing.\nReferences\nNow this is a quick note as I found a nice little reference to the original infinity war comic where hulk falls into the staircase of dr strange and warns him about thanos. It alligns almost perfectly with the original comics scene where silver surfer falls down onto dr strange's stair case and warns him about thanos.\nCGI\nNow i think the most inconcistent part of the movie was the cgi where sometimes, cgi would make it seem that thanos was powerful enough to throw a moon at iron man while it made it seem like the hulk buster suit was just not that beliveable.\nOverall grade: \nI give this movie a 9 out of 10 due to everything but the cgi, if it could just be a little better than it would get that perfect score of 10/10 but for now we have to settle with what we got.","displayName":"Ethan J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-04T17:40:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-04T18:00:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"977346631","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ethan J","accountLink":"/user/id/977346631"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Different from the rest action every minute, it has you on your feet, you don‚Äôt know was gonna come next, very close to the comic book, two hours long, worth every penny I spent on it.
