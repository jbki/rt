The characters came together wonderfully and they each had their own moment in the spotlight. Great acting, Directing, and Writing.  Not only did Josh Brolin pull off a terrific Thanos, his ability to bring the character to life made you both despise... and emphasize Thanos. Well done!","displayName":"Ryan A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1674454834/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T22:21:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T22:27:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"967374655","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan A","accountLink":"/user/id/967374655"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I don't think I've ever been more surprised by a film. The Empire Strikes back of its time, this movie is dark, full of heart, and never forgets its characters or the endless intricate plots and dynamics it is weaving. It's always taking risks and they ALWAYS succeed. Somehow Thanos is a brilliant villain. They also make all of the past movies matter and bring back so much from the past we haven't seen in ages, and ONCE AGAIN makes them matter. Blown away. I cannot wait to watch this many times over. I had no hope this movie could be great, and I think its easily amazing.","displayName":"Alex G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1479360147/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T22:17:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T22:20:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"784245655","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex G","accountLink":"/user/id/784245655"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is a great movie ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T22:15:40.626Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T01:39:31.735Z","user":{"userId":"954867756","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/954867756"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie have ever seen it is amazing, and incredible ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T22:15:25.471Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T22:15:46.880Z","user":{"userId":"260125344","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260125344"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved this movie from start to finish!!","displayName":"Bonnie C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/776578131/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T22:11:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T22:12:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"881862429","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bonnie C","accountLink":"/user/id/881862429"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Definitely consider watching this movie sometime. 9/10","displayName":"Herr S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T22:10:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T22:12:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"977251836","realm":"RT","displayName":"Herr S","accountLink":"/user/id/977251836"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love it!!
