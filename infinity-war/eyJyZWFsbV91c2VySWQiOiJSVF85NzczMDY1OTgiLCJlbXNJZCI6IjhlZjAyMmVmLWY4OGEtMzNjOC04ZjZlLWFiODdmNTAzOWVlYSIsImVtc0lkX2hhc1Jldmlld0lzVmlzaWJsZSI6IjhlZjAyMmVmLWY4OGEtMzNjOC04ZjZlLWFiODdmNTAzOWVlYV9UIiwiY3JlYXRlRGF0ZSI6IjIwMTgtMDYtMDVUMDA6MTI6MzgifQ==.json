The characters all felt like hey had meaning and Josh Brolin as the villain perfectly portrayed the villain we had wanted for years. The ending was spectacular with the emotional attachment that you had with the characters LITERALLY turned to dust. However, there were so many storylines that they focused on for so long that when they cut back to the other storyline you are like “oh yeah, this is still happening.” Overall this is the best movie that the MCU has put out","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-04T16:18:27.438Z","updateDate":"2018-06-04T16:18:36.603Z","user":{"userId":"974903859","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/974903859"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The ending was trash ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-04T16:07:50.343Z","updateDate":"2018-06-04T16:07:50.343Z","user":{"userId":"260143323","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260143323"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Better than Thor Raknorak","displayName":"Judith S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1015194161823983/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-04T15:46:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-04T15:47:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"970383313","realm":"RT","displayName":"Judith S","accountLink":"/user/id/970383313"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I'd lost interest in the Marvel Movies- this reignited the flame.","displayName":"Eric S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-04T14:24:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-04T14:25:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"976971803","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eric S","accountLink":"/user/id/976971803"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"OW DOWN TO MARVEL THANKS FOR THE BEST 10 YEARS OF MY LIFE THIS MOVIE SO COOL BEST MCU MOVIE AND SHOULD HAVE A WAY HIGJER TOMATOMETER ABSOLOUTLEY MIND BLOWING","displayName":"Adam W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-04T14:08:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-04T14:08:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"977306119","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adam W","accountLink":"/user/id/977306119"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I feel like this might have been the best superhero movie I have ever seen.
