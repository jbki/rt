I must say the movie was really good!!!(#infinitywar) props to the Russo brother to joggling so many characters and plots, and also props to them to making one of their best villain, instead of a disposable character like some movie in the mcu! Definitely worth seeing it you are a MCU fan , and definitely I need to gave it a 2nd watch!
