I resent Disney for their butchering of Star Wars with the Last Jedi. And I typically don't like Marvel movies as much as the general public. But I really enjoyed this film. It is all over the universe and there wasn't a moment wasted. It was fun to see the various Marvel Heroes come together to fight a common foe (vs. each other as with Civil War). And I thought the film makers stayed true to the Comic book characters for the most part. I went in expecting the Black Order to play a small part but was pleasantly surprised with how much screen time they received. I wish DC could make a film that is this fun to watch.","displayName":"Cam T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T09:05:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T18:52:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"976959415","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cam T","accountLink":"/user/id/976959415"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is best think that we could get from Russo brothers","displayName":"Mateusz R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T08:58:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T09:00:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248391","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mateusz R","accountLink":"/user/id/977248391"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":" Best marvel movie yet.
