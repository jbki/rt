I didn't think Thanos would be interesting, but they gave him motivations beyond the simple \" I want to rule the universe.... MWAHAHAHAAHA.\" My only real complaint is that the Hulk was terrible in this movie. Every line uttered by Mark Ruffalo was cringe-inducing, unfunny crap. Overall, Joe and Anthony Russo are the kings of the MCU.","displayName":"James C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-24T16:31:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-24T16:41:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"977315451","realm":"RT","displayName":"James C","accountLink":"/user/id/977315451"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is the best movie I've ever seen, from the CGI, to the costumes, drama action.

It was great for fans who understood the connection to other films; but may be harder to appreciate on it's own without having seen the other films associated with this genre.  The primary villain has great character development throughout the movie; however his supporting cast isn't developed as well.  Dialogue and plot seems solid, only slightly rushed, with narrow focus of scope.  It's a great set up for it's second part and is worthy of 4/5 stars.","displayName":"Tim M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-24T07:40:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-24T07:48:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"977436934","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tim M","accountLink":"/user/id/977436934"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent ready for part 2","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-24T05:52:12.592Z","updateDate":"2018-08-24T05:52:12.592Z","user":{"userId":"931447537","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/931447537"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 24, 2018"}]}
