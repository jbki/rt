The action was great, the CGI was amazing and there was a lot of humour. The whole theatre was laughing at the banter between some of the characters. Thanos make a great bad guy because he truly believes that what he is doing is for the good of humanity. Looking forward to part 2.

It was terrible trying to sit through the whole movie. What a waste of time and money. Who wrote this???? Seriously! Omg! It's definitly not for kids. Way too much intense violence with a dark theme. Over 2 hours of watching our heros get there butts kicked senseless. Depressing even for an adult. Just a very dark movie with a demonic feel and disrespectful sarcasm about Christ.","displayName":"R P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T04:13:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T04:22:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247925","realm":"RT","displayName":"R P","accountLink":"/user/id/977247925"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great, but I hated the ending ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T04:13:27.488Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T04:13:27.488Z","user":{"userId":"927244197","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/927244197"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"}]}
