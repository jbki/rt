I was surprised that the ending surprised so many of the general public, without giving anything away, the source material from the comics as well as the previews leading up to the film kind of hinted towards the end of the movie so much so that once the \"shocking\" ending happened, I would've honestly been more shocked if it hadn't happened as it did. So based on how I think everything is going to be resolved in Avengers 4 I give this one 4/5 stars, but it could raise or lower based on the actual resolution.\n\nI will say that the Russo brothers did an excellent job at balancing all the heroes. Sure, some get less time than others, but the jumps between everyone and character introductions were flawless. Steve Rogers and company probably wins the award for best introduction in the film, with an epic scene that got the first round of applause of the night in my showing. The action sequences are some of the most exciting we've seen in an MCU movie to date. The acting is great as well, with standout performances by Downey, Cumberbatch, Saldana, and Bautista probably the best in the film. Also noteworthy, the humor is great in what otherwise could have just been a straight faced dull epic. The best of the humor is Drax gets some hilarious sequences, Stark still has a few great sarcastic quips up his sleeve, and the first meeting between Steve Rogers and Groot lends a brief funny moment during the film's climax.\n \nOverall, this movie was very well done and everything you could have ever wanted in an MCU film if you're a hard core or even casual fan. I've heard some people say the middle was slow, I didn't feel that way at all. Some characters get less character insight than others, but I suspect that will be made up for in the next film. The only problem with this film is the ending, not necessarily because of what happens, but because there are other movies with already scheduled release dates to come in the future that make you realize that not everything you saw in the last 5 minutes is permanent. Take that for what you will.","displayName":"Peter C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T10:42:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T10:56:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246023","realm":"RT","displayName":"Peter C","accountLink":"/user/id/977246023"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie was epic??","displayName":"Matthew%20 N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T10:40:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T10:47:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245875","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew%20 N","accountLink":"/user/id/977245875"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The only downside about this movie is having to wait a whole year to find out what happens next!","displayName":"Griselda H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T10:36:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T10:37:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246018","realm":"RT","displayName":"Griselda H","accountLink":"/user/id/977246018"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This film was exceptional. Had me gripped from the get go It didn't let up. The Russo's did a phenomenal job managing all these characters in one film. Although the ending wasn't of the happy kind and leaves a lot up in the air it was done perfectly and left me feeling a lot of emotions. It wasn't supposed to be a closed ending. There's still so much story left to tell. I can't wait to see the second film.\n\nThis film is fantastic and maybe after the second part we'll never see a film like this, done to this high standard again.","displayName":"Graham B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T10:31:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T10:38:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246010","realm":"RT","displayName":"Graham B","accountLink":"/user/id/977246010"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excelente la mejor del ucm","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10211755940040944/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T10:31:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T10:32:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246007","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977246007"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"As a Marvel fan, this movie was so breathtaking.
