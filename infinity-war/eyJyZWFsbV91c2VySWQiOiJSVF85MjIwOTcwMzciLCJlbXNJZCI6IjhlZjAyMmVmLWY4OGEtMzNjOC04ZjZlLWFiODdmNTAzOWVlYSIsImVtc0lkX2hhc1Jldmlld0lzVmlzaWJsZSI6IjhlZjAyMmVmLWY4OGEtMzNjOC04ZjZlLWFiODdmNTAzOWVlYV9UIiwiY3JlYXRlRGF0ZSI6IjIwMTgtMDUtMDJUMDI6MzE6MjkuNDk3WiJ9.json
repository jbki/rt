I am a longtime Guardians of the Galaxy fan, too. However, I left this movie with a “ why did I bother to spend the money ?” kind of feeling. I suppose if just one or even two of the cast didn’t make it through and ended up dying it would be a surprise but there would still be more of a purpose for this movie than just special effects and a whole lot of fighting and killing. The acting for the most part was very good.....but the purpose for this movie totally escapes me. Won’t be seeing any sequels especially if they somehow resurrect the characters to make more money off fans.

Having digested this movie for a day now, I can honestly say I'm ready to see it again. From the outset, I knew I wasn't getting a run of the mill Marvel movie. Thanos was really flushed out well. His motivations were able to be understood. He was human enough to be relatable. What I loved the most was the bad guy won. Heroes died. The bold direction taken with charcters some loved, some didn't, and some were like meh about was as well done as one could when involving so many characters at once. I applaud Marvel for subverting us well, with respect to the characters and fans, unlike some directors I won't mention.

In fact, it's one of the best movies of all time. Juggling so many characters so effectively has never been done before. Excellent from beginning to end. Excellent use of humor, without overdoing it.
