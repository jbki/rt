A masterful blending and balancing of several characters, tones, and styles. The sheer scale of this film makes it feel like a historic epic such as Braveheart, Gladiator, or Lawrence of Arabia. A fabulous portrayal of Thanos by Josh Brolin. This film is Thanos' film; he is the main player and star. The film subverts expectations in the end by ending with the villain winning (until the upcoming Avengers film).","displayName":"Patrick L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-23T16:22:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-23T16:26:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"977332312","realm":"RT","displayName":"Patrick L","accountLink":"/user/id/977332312"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 23, 2018"}]}
