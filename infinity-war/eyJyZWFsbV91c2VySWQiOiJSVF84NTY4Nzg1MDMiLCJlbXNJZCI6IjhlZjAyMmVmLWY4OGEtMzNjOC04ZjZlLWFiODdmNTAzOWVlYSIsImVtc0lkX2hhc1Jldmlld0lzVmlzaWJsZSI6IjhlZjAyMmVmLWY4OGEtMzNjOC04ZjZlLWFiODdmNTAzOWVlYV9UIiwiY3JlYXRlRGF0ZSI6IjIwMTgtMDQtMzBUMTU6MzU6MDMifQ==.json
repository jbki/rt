Gripping, devistating, funny all at the same time Kept my attention easily even though it is 2 hrs 40 mins long. Without giving spoilers, I'm hoping part 2 recifies all that happens in part 1.

Bahahaha this site is a complete joke considering they gave Star Wars The Last Jedi above a 90.\n\nThis movie is basically the best movie in history.  It is this culmination of the past 10 years of good to great superhero movies that we've all fell in love with.  The plot was pin point and even if you hadn't seen any of the previous movies, the story was easy to grapple.  Thanos as the main character and villain was a brilliant idea and the movie is better because of it.  I'm going to see it again for a third time later this week, after seeing it the second time the feelings I had were more than doubled.  The emotions one feels after the ending of Infinity War alone are the reason it is by far the greatest movie ever.","displayName":"Shawn H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T15:10:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T15:17:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"917909339","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shawn H","accountLink":"/user/id/917909339"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is probably my favorite movie in the MCU","displayName":"James O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T15:09:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T15:10:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"973180359","realm":"RT","displayName":"James O","accountLink":"/user/id/973180359"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"}]}
