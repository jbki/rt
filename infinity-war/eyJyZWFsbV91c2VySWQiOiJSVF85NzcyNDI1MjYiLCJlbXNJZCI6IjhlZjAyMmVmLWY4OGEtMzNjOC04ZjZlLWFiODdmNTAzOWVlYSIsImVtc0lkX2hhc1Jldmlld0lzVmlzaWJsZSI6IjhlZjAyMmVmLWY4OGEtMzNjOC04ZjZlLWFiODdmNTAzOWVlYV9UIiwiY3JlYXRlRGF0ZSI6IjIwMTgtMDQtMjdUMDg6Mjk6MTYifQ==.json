Somehow they’ve done it. Avengers Infinity War is the best Marvel film in a long long time and as someone who’s not enjoyed them for a quite a while this is quite the compliment. From the outset it’s clear that this is a different type of Marvel film. The stakes are much more threatening, no one is safe. Thanos is a fantastic villain and is given a real backstory that almost makes you emphasize with him at certain points. Well, almost. All the characters are given ample screen time and its is a credit to the writers and directors that somehow it all works. Tony Stark, Thor and the Guardians were all a personal highlight for me but all characters are treated well and fairly. There are twist and turns and truly shocking moments that even brought me to tears. I can’t believe I’m writing all this about a Marvel film but trust me it really is that good. Action sequences are well handled and special effects are on point for the most part. It’s up there with the best Marvel films and is by far as good as it could possibly have been given the weight of expectation.
