The ending was wack AF ! Okay let me break this down. This movie was long as hell and for the ending to be as wack as it was I'm speechless. I am not a Marvel comics enthusiast with the exception of X-men. I came to see this movie because I saw black panther and was intrigued and wanted to see more of the same, but was highly disappointed. The ending made the entire movie null and void!! I wish I could say more but I don't want to spoil. The actors did a good job, and there were many funny moments and sarcasm. The action scenes were good, but so are the action scenes in other films (in other words there wasn't anything extraordinary). I actually paid to see this movie in 3D. If you are on the fence as to whether or not you want to pay to see this movie, then I say save your money unless someone else is paying.","displayName":"Nicole S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T22:50:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T22:51:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"977240534","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nicole S","accountLink":"/user/id/977240534"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Marvel is always the best.Never disappointing the fans.\nThis movie has everything at it's best the plot,cast,vfx and everything.\nCompared to other films vison's power is disappointing to fans.\nThe way the movie ends brings you more curiosity to watch the 2nd part of infinity war.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/767056356838334/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T22:47:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T22:52:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250018","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977250018"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Watching this film was equal to getting beaten to death with a pillowcase full of your favorite items 12/10, would watch again","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T22:46:40.328Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T22:46:40.328Z","user":{"userId":"950819476","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/950819476"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Infinity War es una buena culminación a 10 años de Marvel trayendo esta linea temporal de los cómics a la pantalla grande, o bueno podría decirse gran culminación ya que el final nos deja un sabor amargo pero con mucha expectativa por ver a la Capitán Marvel.","displayName":"Sebastian D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10208724462961800/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T22:46:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T22:50:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"975523980","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sebastian D","accountLink":"/user/id/975523980"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie delivered for me. I really enjoyed the story and the action. They did a great job at progressing the story while keeping up the action without it feeling overboard. I also didn't mind the length which sometimes I do, but this paced well. If you go into this movie expecting anything more than an summer blockbuster with big action, CGI and some laughs then you probably shouldn't bother wasting the time.
