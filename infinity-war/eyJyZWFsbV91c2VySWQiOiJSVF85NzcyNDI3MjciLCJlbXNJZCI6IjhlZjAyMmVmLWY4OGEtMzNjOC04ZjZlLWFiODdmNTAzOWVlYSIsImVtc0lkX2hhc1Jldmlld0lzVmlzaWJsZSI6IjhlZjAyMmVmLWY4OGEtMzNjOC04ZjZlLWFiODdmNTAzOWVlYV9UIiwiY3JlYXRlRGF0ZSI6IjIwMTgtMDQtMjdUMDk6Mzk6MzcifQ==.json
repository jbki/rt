Thanos was expertly characterized and is by far my favorite antagonist within the MCU, they truly granted him a level of depth that is not common amongst any of the other Marvel villains, or in villains within the industry as a whole. However, on the whole I'm not going to be able to give the totality of my feelings towards the film until the second one is released next May. This is because I am unable to judge the effectiveness and awesomeness of the plot devices utilized in this film, until we get to view their endgame in Avengers 4. I feel that on the whole, it is a fantastic film, however, if executed correctly, the second part will blow it out of the water as it will be the culmination of the long time events involved in all 18 prior films, composed with the short term events featured in Infinity War. In my opinion, it will be very similar to that of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 & 2, where the first film can sometimes feel open ended, however, if produced correctly, can provide an element of closure not witnessed within the first part.\n\n- Barclay H.","displayName":"Barclay H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T09:32:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T09:45:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"977242701","realm":"RT","displayName":"Barclay H","accountLink":"/user/id/977242701"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"And I thought BvS was bad... undeveloped fight scenes culminating in fake deaths of characters that didn't really die and are going to be saved before their own sequels all for the sake of setting up the next Avengers movie.

I am not a comic book reader @ all, so I had to do some research on the back story of this, but as a straight up action movie in the Avengers saga, this was amazing. The special effects were on point along with the ever so awesome Marvel quips and such! It was also very serious and dark in some places, so the contrast was great! By far the best Avengers movie so far!
