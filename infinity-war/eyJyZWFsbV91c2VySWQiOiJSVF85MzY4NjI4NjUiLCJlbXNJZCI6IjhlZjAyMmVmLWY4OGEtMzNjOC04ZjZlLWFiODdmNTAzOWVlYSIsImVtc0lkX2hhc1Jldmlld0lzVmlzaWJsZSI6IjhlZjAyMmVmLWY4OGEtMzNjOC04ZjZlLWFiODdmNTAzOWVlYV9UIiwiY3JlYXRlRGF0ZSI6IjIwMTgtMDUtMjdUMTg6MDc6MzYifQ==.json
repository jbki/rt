The twist they put on the Thanos and his reasons for wanting to acquire the power of the stones was a well done as portraying his original comic run reasons would of involved a separate movie in and of itself to setup. Only real complaints would be the Hulk or lack thereof and my fear of what the post credit scene means if handled with the same ham fisted fashion that the Marvel comics industry is experiencing.","displayName":"Dustin C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-27T15:59:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-27T16:05:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"977271167","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dustin C","accountLink":"/user/id/977271167"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 27, 2018"}]}
