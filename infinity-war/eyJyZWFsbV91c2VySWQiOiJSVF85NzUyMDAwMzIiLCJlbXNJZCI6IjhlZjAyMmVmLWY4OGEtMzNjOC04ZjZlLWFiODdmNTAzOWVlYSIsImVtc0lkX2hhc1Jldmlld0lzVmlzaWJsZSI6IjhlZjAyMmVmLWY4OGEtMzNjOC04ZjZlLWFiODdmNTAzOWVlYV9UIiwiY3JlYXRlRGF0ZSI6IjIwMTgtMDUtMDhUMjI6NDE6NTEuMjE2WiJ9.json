It's action packed but the some Guardians scenes still made me fall asleep literally. Spiderman's pleading before he died was really bad acting.

Especially clown jugglers. But, fortunately, while Avengers Infinity War juggles and juggles so many moving pieces and characters, there are no clowns. Although, if they were to throw a clown into the mix, this movie would somehow make it work. It's just that good. This movie rocked and rolled for 2 1/2 hours. I got out of my seat to use the restroom for five and I am sure I missed 5 amazing battles. Probably the best one too... when a clown shows up and they kill it.\n\nThis is the best Marvel movie to date. My only complaint is that it could have used some Ant Man. Paul Rudd could have really saved this movie from failure. Fortunately, it will still make 5 bajillion dollars, even though Paul Rudd isn't in it.","displayName":"Abe Y","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1663685143/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T21:20:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-08T21:20:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"847895886","realm":"RT","displayName":"Abe Y","accountLink":"/user/id/847895886"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"oh my gosh! a movie that's actually enjoyable. so much so I'll go watch it again!
