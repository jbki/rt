Marvel really chose well inviting the Russo brothers back to direct probably the biggest comic book movie ever in terms of scale, they translated their success of Cap 2 and 3 onto a far wider spectrum of characters and locations without losing the same kind of tone the MCU had set up over the preceding 10 years, and the writing as well was just outstanding; they managed to make Thanos the central character in an Avengers movie, whilst not taking the focus too heavily off of the Avengers, despite them essentially being a supporting cast. More than that though, they made Thanos compelling and multi-layered, you can almost empathise with his motivations, despite the misguided manner in which he executes them, and the expectation subversion in the end just makes for a truly great piece of tragic storytelling, leaving us crushed yet simultaneously satisfied and wanting more. Visually the whole film is utterly gorgeous, all of the shots in space and on other planets are all individually distinct, and feel like separate entities to the more familiar setting of Earth, Vormir in particular is utterly breathtaking. And my god does Alan Silvestri know how to write an amazing score, manages to get you pumped, break your heart and make you fear the worst in equal measure, how he didn't get an Oscar nod for this film I will never know! If you're not a die hard Marvel fan there may be elements of the film that'd be slightly lost on you initially, such as who Thanos is, or what happened at the beginning with the Asgardian ship, what Xandar is, how the infinity stones have been woven into the universe, etc, but actually for the most part I don't think you would be completely lost, even if this was your first MCU film, as I feel it does just enough to give new viewers enough information, whilst not boring those of us who had seen the prior 18 films with details with which we were already very familiar. I am still quite surprised that critics are so torn with this film, and I feel like the simple truth is they're spending too long judging it as a standalone movie, which really isn't the point of the film, it had a lot of buildup over 10 years, and also set us up for more, two more films were impliedly the end-credits scene alone. For me whilst Endgame is far more discernible as a three-act epic, Infinity War I feel is a better film in spite of what the critics say, it just has better general pacing, it doesn't slow down too much yet at the same time manages to keep in control despite the gargantuan number of characters in play, and the cliché dodge at the end really makes it stand out amongst other entries in the MCU.","displayName":"James T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-13T22:37:48.076Z","updateDate":"2019-09-13T22:37:48.076Z","user":{"userId":"968002374","realm":"RT","displayName":"James T","accountLink":"/user/id/968002374"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"this is master piece perfectly balanced and thanos deserve Oscar  josh borlin  make this thanos story arc eternal ","displayName":"Ayaz A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/975628905918778/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-13T20:52:26.463Z","updateDate":"2019-09-13T20:52:26.463Z","user":{"userId":"977253394","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ayaz A","accountLink":"/user/id/977253394"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 13, 2019"}]}
