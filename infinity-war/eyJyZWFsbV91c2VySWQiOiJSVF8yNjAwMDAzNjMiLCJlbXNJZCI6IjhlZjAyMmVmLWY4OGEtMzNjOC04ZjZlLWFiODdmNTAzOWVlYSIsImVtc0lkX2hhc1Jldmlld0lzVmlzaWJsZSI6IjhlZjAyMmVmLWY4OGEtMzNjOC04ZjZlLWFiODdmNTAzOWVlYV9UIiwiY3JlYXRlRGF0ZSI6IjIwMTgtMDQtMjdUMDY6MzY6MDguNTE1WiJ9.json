There are definitely some great moments in the movie. Some really good humor and dialogue. The writers tried really hard to give the antagonist a reason behind his “snapping finger”. But it falls out flat. On a movie of such scale, giving screen time for everyone is difficult but the directors did a decent job (although some might be disappointed). It is sure worth to watch one time. But it is a serious movie by Marvel.
