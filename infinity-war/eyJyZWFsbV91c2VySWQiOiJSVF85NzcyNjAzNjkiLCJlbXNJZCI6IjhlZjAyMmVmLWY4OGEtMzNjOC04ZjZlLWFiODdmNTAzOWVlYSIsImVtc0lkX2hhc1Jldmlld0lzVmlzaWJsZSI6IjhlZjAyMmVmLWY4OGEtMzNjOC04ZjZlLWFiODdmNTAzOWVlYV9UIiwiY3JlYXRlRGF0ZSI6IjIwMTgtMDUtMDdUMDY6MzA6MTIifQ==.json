I suppose it is a movie for the playstation/Xbox generation where snazzy visuals are all that matter.  This is basically a cartoon intercut with live action scenes. Tom Holland being interviewed on the Graham Norton show even said that in certain scenes he filmed that he had no idea what was going on and no idea who else was even in the scene with him. That says it all really. An overlong, convoluted mess on a movie. One of the many places we go to on our whirlwind tour of the Marvel universe is a place called 'Knowwhere' which is where this shambles quickly goes.Tripe such as this, Wonder Woman and The Last Jedi prove that the art of great movie storytelling has been lost. Sad, very sad.","displayName":"Bernard C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T05:03:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T05:19:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"914017255","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bernard C","accountLink":"/user/id/914017255"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It's okay and good fun so worth watching. The ratings will eventually settle down around the 60% mark. \n\nBest bit IMO:\n\nThanos: you should have gone for the head\n\nThor: yeeees but this is the world of Disney and as much as that's what I would do in the real world given how nasty you've been, I can't as then we lose the revenue from children's tickets and there'd be no sequel.","displayName":"Professor Zaffer I","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T04:45:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T04:45:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"977260310","realm":"RT","displayName":"Professor Zaffer I","accountLink":"/user/id/977260310"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Not crazy about the movie.

The emotional impact on the audience had meaning and advanced the story. The humor, while hokey at times, works because it's established and the characters have good chemistry and have excellent timing for delivery of the serious and comedic lines. In short, one of the best MCU movies to date. My issue with the movie is simply the ending. It lacks emotional weight and I don't think will stand the test of time because every knows this isn't the end.","displayName":"Jeffrey T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/570970175/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T04:36:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T04:40:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"795605585","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeffrey T","accountLink":"/user/id/795605585"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"}]}
