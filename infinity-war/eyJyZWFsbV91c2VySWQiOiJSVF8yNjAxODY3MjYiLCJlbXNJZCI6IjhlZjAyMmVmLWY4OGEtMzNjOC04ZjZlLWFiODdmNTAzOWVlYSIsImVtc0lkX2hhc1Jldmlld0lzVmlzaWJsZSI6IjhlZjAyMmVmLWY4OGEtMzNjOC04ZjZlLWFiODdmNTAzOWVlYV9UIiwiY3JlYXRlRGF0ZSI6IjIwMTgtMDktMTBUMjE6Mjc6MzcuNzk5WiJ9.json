Marvel tops themselves with every new movie. Superb entertainment! ...BUT..there’s one caveat, no, two...THREE! The Hulk, Vision, and Dr. Strange...First, The Hulk not wanting to be The Hulk on Earth. Also The Hulk doesn’t k own how to fight. He’s just so strong and the more enraged he becomes, the stronger he becomes. Not that he’ll be able to do much since Thanos K.O’d him in 3mins, because Thanos knows how to fight. All Visions’ superior superpowers (flying, mind stone, teleporting, phasing, etc) immediately disabled. And most of all Doctor Strange time stone. The Avengers were neutered. They had to do this for Thanos to win, and the plot, to work, they had to remove/dismantle a chunk of the team.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-10T15:19:35.333Z","updateDate":"2018-12-23T01:44:39.584Z","user":{"userId":"946895768","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/946895768"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Infinity War lives up to expectations and unlike Age of Ultron and Civil War which were mostly filler movies, something meaningful actually happens at the end and the heroes are finally put against a great villain who carries the film on his own.

I think infinity war might be one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. Nothing resembling believability in any second of the film, boring dialogue, a total excess of forgetable characters. The physics is terribly inconsistent, the cgi bad, the characters are boring. The action is just like a transformers movie, just pointless things moving around. Not only dull, but cringeworthy.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1814074048887663/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-10T06:44:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-10T06:44:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"977257379","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977257379"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie was amazing, the actors were fantastic, the soundtrack fit the movie perfectly, and there were some pretty funny moments in the movie.","displayName":"Sunny N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-09T18:33:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-09T18:36:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977461479","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sunny N","accountLink":"/user/id/977461479"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Entertaining enough. Maybe the superhero phase has been too played out for me. Infinity War is a solid entry into the Marvel universe.
