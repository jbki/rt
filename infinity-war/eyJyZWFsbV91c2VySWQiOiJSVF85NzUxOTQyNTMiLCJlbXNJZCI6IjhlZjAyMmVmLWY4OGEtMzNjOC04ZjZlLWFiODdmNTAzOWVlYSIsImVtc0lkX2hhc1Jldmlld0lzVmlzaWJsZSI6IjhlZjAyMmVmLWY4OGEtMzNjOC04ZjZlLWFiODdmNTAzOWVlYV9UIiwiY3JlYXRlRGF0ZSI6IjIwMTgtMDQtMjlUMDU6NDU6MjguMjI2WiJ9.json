Great cast and great actors... really makes huge impact! A tear jerker and enjoyable film all throughout. A culmination of 10 years worth of character development and storyline investment-brings us to one massive film (2-part?). Amazingly done with even screen share for everybody in the film. This is not just an Avenger film, this is very much a Thanos film as well! You don't leave the cinema with hate of the villain but a sense of understanding. A true movie for everyone to enjoy not just for Marvel fans!","displayName":"Michael B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T05:42:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T05:56:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248046","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael B","accountLink":"/user/id/977248046"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I think it was good, I'm no professional critic but the ending was unsatisfying, the fight scenes were ok but had some moments that were bad to me still it was good, I strongly recommend you to watch","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/244220912822449/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T05:40:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T05:44:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248041","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977248041"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie!

It never disappoints. The movie is filled with unexpected twists and surprising moments. Thanos is an amazing villian with a great motive and backstory. The movie is filled with tons of characters and action. The movie didn't seem oversaturated to me because they were able to give enough screentime for each character. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is the best marvel movie in my opinion, and it was able to exceed all my expectations.","displayName":"Mahdi K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T05:27:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T05:40:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248022","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mahdi K","accountLink":"/user/id/977248022"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"}]}
