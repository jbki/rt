Not a great movie, won't win any oscars except maybe a technical one.... but highly entertaining and not full of that SJW crap that thoroughly ruined the Last Jedi.   Prime example of good story telling with strong male and female characters, no gender politics needed, no diversity dogma (that naturally came with the well written character Black Panther and did not feel forced).  Just straight up good fun and ended on a superb cliff hanger.... can't wait to see the next one.","displayName":"Paul T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T08:17:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T08:19:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"977079789","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paul T","accountLink":"/user/id/977079789"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"exelente la pelicula","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/192587538032416/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T08:15:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T08:17:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"977259200","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977259200"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Impressive juggling act with a massive cast, but this leads to unavoidable pacing issues.","displayName":"Brian S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T08:03:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T16:09:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"977259181","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian S","accountLink":"/user/id/977259181"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"happy and sad at the same time. epic ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T08:00:42.900Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T08:01:37.027Z","user":{"userId":"951981395","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/951981395"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":" Fun and one of the better Marvel movies.
