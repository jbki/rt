But when you consider all the factors, it is as good as it could have been. Some great timed comedic lines (a couple not so much), a lot of drama, multiple heroes that each one has its own time and place and a villain that really comes up as unbeatable.\nThanos is an ideal bad guy because of two main factors: He is truly powerful and determined, and as a refreshing feature, his motivation is not to rule the universe. In his own twisted grasp of morale, he believes he is doing a greater good. And if you look at it with a cold scientific eye, he is not wrong.\nHard core Marvel fans had an idea of what would develop by the shocking conclusion of Infinity war, and still have for the next chapter. But even them should have had a couple of mind blowing twists that may require therapy.\nThose that felt that it ended abruptly and that things are not really resolved, they need to realize that this feature was planned as a \"Part 1\" from its conception.\nTo summarize... I loved it.","displayName":"Ricardo Arturo J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/872405176/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T09:18:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T15:53:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"958043548","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ricardo Arturo J","accountLink":"/user/id/958043548"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely stunning and incredible! The culmination of 10 years worth of backstories  exploding into one great action packed flick. Be sure to watch prior Marvel movies (picks up right after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Spiderman: Homecoming, Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Black Panther, Dr Strange, and Thor: Ragnorak), as they waste no time explaining backstories.\n\nDISNEY TAKE NOTE! This is how you put together a blockbuster franchise film! Now please do something to undo that  train-wreck of a film, The Last Jedi.","displayName":"Kelly W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T09:17:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T09:10:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"977030032","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kelly W","accountLink":"/user/id/977030032"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"epic movie ever!..love the trailer to new star wars movie..Bubba fett!... and Shazam starring Dwayn johnson the Rock playing the bad guy!  and Disney live action Aladdin genie will be played by Will Smith! and dumbo!","displayName":"Robert M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T09:17:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T09:17:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"920220622","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert M","accountLink":"/user/id/920220622"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best MCU movies!","displayName":"Danny V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/548159148/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T09:17:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T09:17:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"832052837","realm":"RT","displayName":"Danny V","accountLink":"/user/id/832052837"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely amazing from start to finish.

Thanks is definitely the greatest villain in marvel closely followed By killmonger and Loki. Let's speak about the film,  from start to finish it's one giant whirlwind of emotions, the beggnning 5 minuted starts with 2 important deaths of 2 characters with very important roles in the Thor series. It then continues to move at a fast pace and you get to enjoy each group of characters reactions to learning of Thanos and what they do during this movie. I won't  spoil any more but I loved this 10/10","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2108108919457094/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T09:15:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T09:21:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250828","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977250828"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"In an age where most comic book movies are molded to whatever shape will earn the most money and easy acclaim, Avengers: Infinity War set out to do something different; tell a story. It's the first marvel movie with real stakes and believable dramatic sequences. The characters are allowed to exist within their own context rather than being forced to be what everyone expects. It was truly refreshing, and felt like a genuine pay off.","displayName":"David C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T09:12:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T09:17:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"911289698","realm":"RT","displayName":"David C","accountLink":"/user/id/911289698"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It is a funny yet disappointing film. There are a few good moments between characters that make the film enjoyable being a large Marvel fan. If you have not seen other films of the franchise I would skip this film. The tragic moments don't  work for me and I wish they done the film only through Thanos eyes, meaning more screen time for the villians being this was their movie. Giving the Black Order and Thanos more of an introduction would have helped  create a type of passion for the film. Most disappointing is Proxy Midnight and the Hulk. It is tragic what they have done to Hulk though this entire franchise. True Hulk fans know what I mean how one of the most complex and power heros is turned into a clown in the end. Proxy Midnight the female vilian visually a beautiful and powerful leader in comic is turned into a monstrous lackey in the film. If you want a good laugh and do not really care for comic see the film. If you want to see  a great Marvel film watch Civil War, Winter Soldier, Dr. Strange  or my favorite so far Black Panther.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/595198527511298/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T09:10:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T09:55:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250820","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977250820"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"VERY COOL!!!
