While it's far from the worst superhero movie I've seen, it felt like little more than two and a half hours of hollow, overblown action sequences. The one liners are plentiful, and some are pretty funny, but they grow as tiresome as the rest of the film in a hurry. What's left to this movie when you take away the cheap jokes and CGI?  The stakes are what they've always been, and the characters fall behind to the grandiose spectacle of it all. They all make terrible decisions, and none of them seem to matter to the script. making this feel like it's just more filler until they release the next installment. And the next. And the next.","displayName":"Rin E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T18:05:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T18:33:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"976958400","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rin E","accountLink":"/user/id/976958400"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I honestly didn't think too much of Infinity war, I just thought it was hard to follow. And I felt like it had too many characters and they didn't seem as special or heroic. Also I think that Thanos was not intimidating at all, and his design was horrible compared to the Avengers. Also the C.G.I was fake looking, and forced. Also, I got major Star Wars prequel vibes coming from this movie! But, it was nice to see Spiderman and Doctor Strange return! So, my final review is 3 and a half stars! :)","displayName":"Henry F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T17:56:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T18:00:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977261500","realm":"RT","displayName":"Henry F","accountLink":"/user/id/977261500"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I can't wait a year for part 2 !?!?
