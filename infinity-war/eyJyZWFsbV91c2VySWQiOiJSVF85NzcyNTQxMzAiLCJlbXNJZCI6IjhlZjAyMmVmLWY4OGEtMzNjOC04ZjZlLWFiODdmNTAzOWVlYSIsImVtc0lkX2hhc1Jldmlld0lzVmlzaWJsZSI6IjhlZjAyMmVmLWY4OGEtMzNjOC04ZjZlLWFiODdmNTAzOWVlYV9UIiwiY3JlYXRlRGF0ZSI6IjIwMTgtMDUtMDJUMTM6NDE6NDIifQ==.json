And yet, it does. It's loaded with spectacle, emotionally powerful moments, and signature Marvel humor, all the while developing a suitably compelling and intimidating villain for its penultimate finale. Despite its bloated runtime, almost every scene furthers the plot in some meaningful way. If there is one major drawback to its narrative however, it's that by the end I felt just a little exhausted from all the bludgeoning and explosive action. There is definitely some fat-trimming that still could have been done here, but even so, Infinity War stands tall as yet another crowning achievement for the MCU, truly living up to its grand ambitions and accomplishing a crossover feat unlike any film before it.","displayName":"Phil S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T13:28:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T11:10:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"976258874","realm":"RT","displayName":"Phil S","accountLink":"/user/id/976258874"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"exciting and sad at the same time","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T13:24:25.895Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T13:24:25.895Z","user":{"userId":"976523078","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976523078"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"I'm probably the only person online who walked away from The Avengers movie disappointed. I just don't understand the point of the entire movie. SPOILER AHEAD.  So they failed in their mission. And half the population of the universe is now gone. So the bad guy gets to sit back and smell flowers. What lesson do we learn from that?  The Avengers only when when the odds are stacked in their favor?","displayName":"Jim B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/764426803/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T13:22:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T13:28:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"880353056","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jim B","accountLink":"/user/id/880353056"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"If you'd like to compare this to any recent release, this movie can be compared to Justice League. Both have an awful lot of CGI and VFX work behind them, and as a result the action scenes (which there are a lot of in this movie) seem disorienting, confusing and headache-inducing. However, what makes this movie work in contrast to Justice League are the good characters, and the entertaining scenes we get with them. Developed, interesting and fun characters such as Thor, Spiderman, Star-Lord, basically every character in this movie has their moments. Even Thanos. It's really what makes Marvel so special to most people, including me.","displayName":"Vincenzo D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T13:19:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T13:32:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"977254105","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vincenzo D","accountLink":"/user/id/977254105"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was amazing, and I was afraid of that it wont be able catch up with the hype","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10215266744760464/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T13:18:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T13:19:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"977254110","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977254110"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Just Epic, this movie itÂ´s everything we always wanted and more","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10213689136795040/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T13:08:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T13:09:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"977254101","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977254101"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Saw it.
