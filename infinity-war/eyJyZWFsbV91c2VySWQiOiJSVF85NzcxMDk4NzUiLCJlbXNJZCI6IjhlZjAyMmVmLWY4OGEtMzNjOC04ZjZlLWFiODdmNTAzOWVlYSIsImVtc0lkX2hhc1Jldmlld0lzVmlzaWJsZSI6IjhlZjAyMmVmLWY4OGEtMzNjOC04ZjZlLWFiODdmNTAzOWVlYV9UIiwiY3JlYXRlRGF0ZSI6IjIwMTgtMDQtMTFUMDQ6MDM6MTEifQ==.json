Apart from Thanos, the only characters left were the 4 main Avengers & Rocket, They tried to cram to many plot threads into one movie, and the result was mediocre. Cinematography wasn't the best either, lots of shaky cam. Fights are to overpowered to Thanos, so they weren't the greatest action scenes either.","displayName":"Andrew E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-10T20:00:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T13:48:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"977215289","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew E","accountLink":"/user/id/977215289"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Outstanding!

These type of events are very common in comics (some fans love them, others loathe them). Fortunately, Infinity War showcases the best parts of these events - fun interactions between the different heroes, a compelling antagonist (Josh Brolin's Thanos is now the ultimate Marvel villain), mind-blowing action sequences, and some emotionally powerful scenes that seriously test these characters to their limits with repercussions that will be felt in succeeding movies (and by enthralled audiences) in the years to come. This truly was a movie event worth the ten-year wait! I highly recommend watching it in IMAX 3D for added value!","displayName":"JV T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/524320937/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-09T21:58:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-09T22:39:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"792727162","realm":"RT","displayName":"JV T","accountLink":"/user/id/792727162"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"AMAZING! 13674235777/5!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/303931203472775/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-09T11:08:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-02T11:21:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977213672","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977213672"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It's really really really really really good I just wanted to to see more of the cap, falcon and black widow","displayName":"james k","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-09T08:36:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-07T03:57:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"977213445","realm":"RT","displayName":"james k","accountLink":"/user/id/977213445"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fantastic start to finish.","displayName":"Luciano D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-09T06:09:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-11T06:50:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"977150564","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luciano D","accountLink":"/user/id/977150564"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is one of the best Marvel movies ever made. Avengers: Infinity war is one of my top 5 favorite Marvel movies, one of my top 5 favorite superhero movies, one of my top 5 favorite action movies, and is one of my favorite movies of all time. The acting was stupendous especially Josh Brolin as Thanos as well as Robert Downey Jr., Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Chris Hemsworth, Elizabeth Olsen, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff, Tom Holland, Benedict Cumberbatch, Chadwick Boseman, Danai Gurira, Paul Bettany, and Don Cheadle as well as the entire rest of the cast. The action scenes and visual effects were spectacular. The writing, story, and screenplay play were all fantastic. The emotional weight of the story was beautiful, touching, and sad, I even cried a little when Gamora was killed by Thanos and got teary eyed when Peter Parker/Spider-Man was disappearing. The production of the whole movie was great. The direction in which Anthony and Joe Russo took the movies was amazing. The musical score composed by Alan Silvestri was fantastic. Also I loved Stan Lee's cameo as the bus driver, it was perfect. I loved this movie immensely and I can not wait to see the sequel, Avengers: Endgame. I really was hoping that it would win the Oscar for best visual effects but at least it got nominated. A+.","displayName":"Noah M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-09T00:52:25.000Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T22:38:31.228Z","user":{"userId":"976779657","realm":"RT","displayName":"Noah M","accountLink":"/user/id/976779657"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"\"Avengers: Infinity War\" is the biggest action blockbuster to date for the MCU that manages to balance a huge selection of superheroes with a dark, thrilling, and surprisingly emotional story. While it is flawed, the Russo Brothers have made (again) an ambitiously fun film that has been ten years in the making and doesn't disappoint with its dazzling special effects and heartbreaking cliff hanger.","displayName":"Ryan C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/697788051/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-08T19:57:43.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-15T11:56:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"808875608","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan C","accountLink":"/user/id/808875608"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 08, 2018"}]}
