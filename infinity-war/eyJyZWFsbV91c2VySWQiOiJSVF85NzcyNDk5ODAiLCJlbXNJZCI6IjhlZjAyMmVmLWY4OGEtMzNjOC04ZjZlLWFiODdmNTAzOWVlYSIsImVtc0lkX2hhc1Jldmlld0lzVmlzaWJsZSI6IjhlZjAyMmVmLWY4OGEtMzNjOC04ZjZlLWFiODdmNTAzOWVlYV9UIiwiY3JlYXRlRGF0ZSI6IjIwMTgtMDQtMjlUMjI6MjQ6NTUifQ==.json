The intricacies that they introduced showed the depth of writing and directing. The humor was fantastic and found myself laughing out loud. The interactions and grouping of Avengers on certain missions was refreshing. They brought out the best in each character. I loved this movie and only took a half star off because it ended on the downer note with anticipation of part II and revenge! It was also nice to see the amount of love and camaraderie that was portrayed in this movie.","displayName":"John S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T22:24:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T22:36:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"976974006","realm":"RT","displayName":"John S","accountLink":"/user/id/976974006"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was The best movie i have seen in a long Time!!!!!","displayName":"Samu M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T22:23:15.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T22:24:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"976954731","realm":"RT","displayName":"Samu M","accountLink":"/user/id/976954731"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Mad cause of the people they killed...but it was great","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T22:23:13.576Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T22:23:13.576Z","user":{"userId":"260124633","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260124633"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"first of all Marvel studios it's way ahead of DC, now after saying this is clear that this movie is totally awesome! the only thing that I don't like about is that I have to wait for the second part otherwise this is the best Avengers movie ever ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T22:22:53.045Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T22:22:53.045Z","user":{"userId":"906463243","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/906463243"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was a solid film, the only problem was that some of the comedy didn't fit in at the right times.
