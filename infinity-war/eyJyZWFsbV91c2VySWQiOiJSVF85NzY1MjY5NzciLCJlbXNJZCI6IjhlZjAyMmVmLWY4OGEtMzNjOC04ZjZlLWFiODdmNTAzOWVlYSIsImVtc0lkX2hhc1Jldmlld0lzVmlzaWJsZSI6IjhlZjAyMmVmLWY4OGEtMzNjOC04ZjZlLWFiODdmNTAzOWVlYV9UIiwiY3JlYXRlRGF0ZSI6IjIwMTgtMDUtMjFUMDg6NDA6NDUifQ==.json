Comic relief from the Guardians characters is really the only plus point I can go for.  It's just all so tedious, essentially the entire Marvel franchise has just become a soap opera, with each only existing to continue the story from the previous entry and to set it up for the next.  Every one blurring into the next.  No thanks, I'm out.","displayName":"Matt C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/661760415/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-21T07:46:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-25T01:50:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"785959210","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt C","accountLink":"/user/id/785959210"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"May 21, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"That's DAMN GOOD writing/acting when you turn the VILLIAN into the ANTI HERO!!!

Never would I have though that this could be a reality and someone actually pulling it off.. And making it work with all these characters in a tight plot structure, if only other franchises *cough* have the brilliance of someone like Kevin Feige... This is basically the finale of all the Marvel movies that came before and totally made for the fans. The fight between Iron man & his group with Thanos was so well made and setup I watched the movie twice just to watch it again (that Dr Strange fight was mind blowing).. The only negatives I can say about the film was a certain plot point involving a planet that wasn't even shown in the film and a unlikely character portrayal involving one of the characters of the GotG, and if youre not a fan you prob would have no idea what is going on haha. Overall, one of the best Avengers/Marvel movies ever.","displayName":"Adrian F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-21T06:00:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-21T06:34:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"977280552","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adrian F","accountLink":"/user/id/977280552"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 21, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome movie and good story","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1773205186092888/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-21T05:58:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-21T05:59:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"977280679","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977280679"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 21, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Excellent Superhero Ensemble movie with an exceptional villain. Have a couple of gripes with it and can't say that i stand by some decisions that the Russo brothers took with the script but this is the best time I've had in a movie theater so far.
