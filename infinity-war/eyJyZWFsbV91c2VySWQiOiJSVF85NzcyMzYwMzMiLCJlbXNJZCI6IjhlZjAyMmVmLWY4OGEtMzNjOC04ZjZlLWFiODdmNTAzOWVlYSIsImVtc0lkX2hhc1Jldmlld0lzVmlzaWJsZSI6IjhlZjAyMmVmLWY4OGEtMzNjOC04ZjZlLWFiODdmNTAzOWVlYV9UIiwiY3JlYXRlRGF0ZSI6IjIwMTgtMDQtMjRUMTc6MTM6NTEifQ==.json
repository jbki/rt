Ten years in the making has resulted in a movie full of epic scope, thrilling action, witty banter and genuine emotion. At the center, directors The Russo Brothers, impressively juggle a large array of characters and make it all work effectively. The movie is also full of spectacle, which the Russos stage with a grounded and visceral quality. It's also not without its flaws though, sometimes there is too much spectacle occurring at once. That being said, the Russos always keep the focus intimately on the characters and provide genuine stakes. Thanks to the villain Thanos, which Brolin performs in an impressive and standout matter, ranking as one the best baddies the MCU has had on-screen. He injects the character with a complex pathology, which makes him more interesting than your standard villain. Overall, The Russos, cast, and writers have whipped up a movie full of heart, laughs, action and well-paced entertainment. One of the best movies of the MCU.","displayName":"Cristian B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/723938758/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T16:37:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-04T11:49:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"792909213","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cristian B","accountLink":"/user/id/792909213"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"10 years, 18 films...it's all led to this...and it PAID.
