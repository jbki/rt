And Chopped up into a number of  different movie scenes that  barely achieve continuity.    It didn't flow welll.  And with so many characters, there is little ability to get more invested in anything resembling the genius of development in Black Panther and Iron Man movies.    However, there are a lot of good pieces within.   Dr. Strange and Tony Stark are terrific together and achieve a rare fun chemistry.    Spider-Man and Tony Stark also have great chemistry.    Thor and  Chris Pratt (Guardians of G) are fun together.    The Hulk getting erectile (I mean green growth) dysfunction. Is amusing .   Thanos actually has an interesting back story.    The witch is cool,  but Ultron is one dimensional and boring .   They give Black Panther too little material to work with.    Indeed his young sister comes offf better than he does this film alll in once scene and. One or two lines.   The FX are great.    Grout is cool.   And I actually liked the fact the villain wins in this first installment.   I'd rate it Below about 4other Marvel Movies and below 1pr 2DC movies.    Worth seeing in theaters, but the ending is going to be very disappointing for many.    It won't be a movie that is seen more than once by most fans.","displayName":"Brian P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T22:15:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T22:31:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247441","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian P","accountLink":"/user/id/977247441"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"By far, my least favorite Avengers film to date.
