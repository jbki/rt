Thanos is well present as a mad Titan as he is one of most powerful marvel movie villain till this date and is the only villain that breaks Marvels bad villain curse because you can see during the movie what chaos he can actually bring to the universe.All the characters are given as much of screen time they can get but truly own each scene they are in, unfortunately, All of the characters split up into teams for the majority this film but the meet up at one point or another.\n\nI would highly recommend this movie to everyone, please bring a box of tissues to Avengers Infinity War because this is truly a culmination of the 19 films that came before.","displayName":"Branden b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T11:18:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T11:52:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"976727460","realm":"RT","displayName":"Branden b","accountLink":"/user/id/976727460"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"An epic half to *hopefully* a great whole.
