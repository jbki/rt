This is not a perfect movie; however, the Russo Bros. pulled off a feat that is merits commendations from both the film industry and cinema-goers.  In a nut shell: fantastic action; incredible usage of IMAX cameras for shots/scenes; WONDERFUL character development (Thanos); timely and appropriate humor and very satisfying end that leaves the audience wanting, re: The Empire Strikes Back.  Cannot wait to see again and again.  I highly recommend.

Overall, the detail included is outstanding, the care that went into making this film stands out. In the end, it amounts to a lot of smashing and breaking, but I question whether it was an all-timer. \n\nPositives\n1. The work on Thanos - the detail in his face was the best CGI yet. \n2. The return of Red Skull was the biggest shock to me.\n3. They didn't get carried away with love stories. \n4. Pepper Potts back as a hero, carrying over from Ironman III?\n5. They did not get carried away with jokes. \n\nNegatives\n1. Star Lord not being able to hold it together for 5 more seconds. \n2. The story is constantly shifting to this planet, then this planet, then this planet over here. Starts to feel very redundant. \n3. Not sure what the heck Vision was doing in this movie besides always needing saving. Complete dud.","displayName":"Brian S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T23:21:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T01:09:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"976944107","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian S","accountLink":"/user/id/976944107"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"captain america winter soldier still the best marvel movie","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T23:17:59.263Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T02:10:51.295Z","user":{"userId":"260115059","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260115059"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wow!
