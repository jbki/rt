It gives every character space and time to join in their well matched pairs and develop together (Strange and Spider-Man / Thor and Rocket / etc). Marvel has also supplied audiences with, finally, a meaningful villain who we have all waited patiently to see. Suprisingly watching him in some gut wrenching scenes (we all know which one) and almost relating to the character as he slaughters each of our beloved hero's, even this might all change in part 2.","displayName":"Ron B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-29T13:28:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-29T13:41:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"977386436","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ron B","accountLink":"/user/id/977386436"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I agree with Thanos and I’m glad that he won.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-29T04:53:05.474Z","updateDate":"2018-07-29T04:53:05.474Z","user":{"userId":"260116206","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260116206"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great movie with great superheroes!
