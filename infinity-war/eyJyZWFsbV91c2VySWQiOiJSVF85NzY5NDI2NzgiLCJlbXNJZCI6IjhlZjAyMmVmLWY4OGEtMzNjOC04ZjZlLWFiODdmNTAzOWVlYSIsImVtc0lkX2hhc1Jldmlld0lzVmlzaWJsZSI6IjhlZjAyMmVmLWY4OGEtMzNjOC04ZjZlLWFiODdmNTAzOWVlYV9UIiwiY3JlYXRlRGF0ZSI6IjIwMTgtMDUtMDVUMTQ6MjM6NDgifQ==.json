If you have not been following the previous movies then you have no business seeing this release.  \nInfinity War is not \"USA for Africa\", never once are all heroes on screen at once doing their hero thing.  There are not \"too many characters\".  In the tradition of Star Trek: The Next Generation we get to see the chemistry between characters that don't normally interact in other stories.  And they don't waste time providing every possible character combination in check list fashion, there is no scene with Black Panther and Dr Strange or team up with Gamora and Black Widow.  \nThe main character is the villain Thanos.  He is not a two dimensional comic book villain that just wants to kill and rule over everyone.  He believes that what he is doing is for the good of all life.  He left a life of comfort to pursue a selfless mission and returns to humble seclusion after the work is done.  This is what makes him scary.  \nThe negative critics from Salon & The New Yorker are just snobby idiots that want accuse the masses of having unsophisticated pallets.  These critics are just a bunch of used anal probes.","displayName":"Brian B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/587900381/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T13:53:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T14:06:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"894998365","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian B","accountLink":"/user/id/894998365"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"top movie 5 out of 5","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2000492546635052/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T13:52:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T13:53:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"976959717","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976959717"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Brilliant , class action from start to finish and fantastic special effects  10/10","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10210761204762024/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T13:49:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T13:52:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"976949349","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976949349"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great emotional roll coaster ride.

At last a CGI villain you can truly love and hate, perhaps for the first time in th genre. Best of all, real stakes, actions with actual consequences, all combined with drama so well-played by the entire cast that only the perfectlyt-timed, now-classic, retrospective, tenstion-breaking humor of Marvel  really matched. The crown jewel of this film however is its innumerable plotlines and sublots that are so masterfully writen and interwoven with one but defining another that for a moment you realize that  10 years was not only worth the wait, but essential to comprehend the gravity, meaning and story of what is by far the most complex and entertaining Marvel movie to date. 5/5","displayName":"John Z","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T13:43:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T13:50:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"837702033","realm":"RT","displayName":"John Z","accountLink":"/user/id/837702033"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great ride, well done, although a bit darker.
