This film with its numerous heros may seem pretty challenging to follow if you're not a hardcore Marvel fan.  However, even though there were 19 movies before this one, Infinity War did a fantastic job of bringing all the movies together into a plot that even a first time Marvel movie watcher could understand and enjoy. As said before Infinity War, movie number 19 of this connected movie franchise, has brought all of their heros and movies together seamlessly into an all out war against one very powerful super villain named Thanos. It's very entertaining to see how the groups of heros interact with one another. Black Panther and Captain America gives the viewers someone to look up to and respect. Dr. Strange and Tony Stark's egotistical outlook on themselves really make a good comedic relief between the many intense fight scenes. The biggest comedic relief however comes from the Guardians of the Galaxy ranging from their old music classics, to their funky way of running their operations really gives the audience something to laugh about amongst the chaos, the chaos of course being Thanos. There is so much background to this villain's rise for power so I'll sum it all up for you. Thanos is on a quest to find 6 gems. Each gem, even though they look like something out of a bedazzling kit you got when you were eight, hold very powerful and specific powers that ultimately will let him kill off half of the universe's population. This is the biggest, baddest, and scariest villain yet, not just because his goal is to wipe out half of the universe's populace, but because he is convinced that he is the good guy. He believes that he is doing the universe a favor by making the hard decisions for it. By killing half of the universe, it makes room for more people to have resources and food to go around ultimately leading to the survival of millions of different species. Obviously the Avengers and all the other heros don't agree with this, and tirelessly try to keep the stones away from Thanos. I will not spoil the movie for you but the ending is much more grim than you would expect and leaves you with more questions than answers. That fact may leave some people metaphorically with a bad taste in their mouth, but we must remember that this is the Marvel universe and not everything is as it seems. So in the meantime appreciate the fact the Marvel's Infinity War has the biggest wow factor in the Marvel Universe so far.","displayName":"Andrew N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T01:07:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T01:12:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"977254712","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew N","accountLink":"/user/id/977254712"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome movie with some nice effects, great story and sad moments.","displayName":"Bo J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T01:07:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T01:07:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"977039925","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bo J","accountLink":"/user/id/977039925"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Avengers Infinity War was Awesome, it went beyond my expectations.
