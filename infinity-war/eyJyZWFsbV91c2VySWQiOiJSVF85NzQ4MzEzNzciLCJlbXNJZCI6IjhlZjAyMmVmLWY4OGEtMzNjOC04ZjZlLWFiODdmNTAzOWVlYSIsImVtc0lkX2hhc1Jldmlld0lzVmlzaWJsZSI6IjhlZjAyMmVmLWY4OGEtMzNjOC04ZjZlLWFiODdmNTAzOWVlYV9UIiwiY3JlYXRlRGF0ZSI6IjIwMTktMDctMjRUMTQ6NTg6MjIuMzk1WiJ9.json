I saw this in the cinema twice and then once again recently and it only get better with each viewing. There are several standout moments and although there are so many characters to fit into one film, it all still comes together beautifully. Endgame is this week and the hype is real. 3 hours to conclude the Infinity Saga.

This film shook up the Marvel formula and it was amazing, that isn't to say that this film isn't without its problems. The film tries to use your emotions as a viewer to make certain scenes in the movie more impactful but it never works and honestly gets annoying. Other characters in the film are under-powered compared to how they are in other Media, and certain female characters like Black Widow are strangely over-powered. Great move, but Endgame has to step it up and improve.
