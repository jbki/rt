Heavens no! Gaping plot holes along with too much humor and some cheese-tastic dialogue keep the film from being spectacular. Is Infinity War the perfect comic book film? It's still a no go on that, but it's fairly epic in its scope and achievements. The positives majorly outweigh the negatives to the point where they couldn't possibly be listed here. With hat said, Infinity War gets a solid 4 out of 5 (for a popcorn flick).","displayName":"Eric A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T19:29:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T19:39:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"561947790","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eric A","accountLink":"/user/id/561947790"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Best Movie of the year!!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2078615589089676/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T19:28:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T19:29:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247126","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977247126"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I'm still left speechless ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T19:28:17.398Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T19:29:29.227Z","user":{"userId":"971993906","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/971993906"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"mighty heroes with mighty unwise minds.
