Despite the number of main characters, the plot structure succeeds in allocating enough time to each well but the tone of the movie is a little all over the place.

It was emotional, thought provoking, well performed, well written, well edited, had great visual effects, and it was unique (the most important quality for me personally). I’ve become bored with most marvel films because they’ve become a bit derivative to me, but this felt like something new. My only gripes with the movie is that the score and soundtrack were hardly noticeable and did little to assist in the emotional appeal. Also there is glaring logic problem in the movie a little bit before the big climax regarding a reckless decision made by one of the characters. It was completely foolish and I have a hard time believing that this person would do that, nor do I believe that the companions of the individual wouldn’t have the foresight to restrain him even if he couldn’t control himself. I’m surprised that many had issues with the ending, because I found it satisfying whilst also intriguing with the knowledge that a Part II is on the way. There have also been complaints that there were too many characters for this movie to handle, but I found that it actually accomplished this masterfully. I can’t say that I didn’t see too little or too much of any character throughout the reasonable 2 1/2 hour runtime. I’ve also noticed that some dislike the ultimate tone that the movie utilizes, which is admittedly depressing, but what else could one have expected? This is the tone the film was marketed under and the tone it needed to be in order to set up the next film. Speaking of the next film, one of the largest arguments people have made about this film is that with the other movies marvel has already announced and is planning on making being in the public eye, the ending of this film will likely be reversed and mean nothing. I say that this statement is closed minded, the kind of thing someone would say if they went into the movie already planning on not enjoying it. These people are projecting their judgments about a movie that hasn’t come out yet onto this one and that isn’t fair. The ending had emotional impact, it set up the motivations for the characters in the next film perfectly, and it did something marvel has never done before which I believe is very commendable. I enjoyed my time with this movie and I recommend seeing it.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T18:43:55.342Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T19:04:27.093Z","user":{"userId":"973722380","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/973722380"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing!!!

We all knew that it was going to be an exhausted with so many superheroes. You can't expect everything to be perfect. The lack of character developmemt was justified due due to the sheer scope of this fun ride. I had my doubts about Thanos but he turned out be MCU's best villain yet, though Loki and Killmonger are not too far behind. There are so many scenes which jolt you to your core. This movie had that X factor which I think was missing from movies such as Black Panther and Spiderman homecoming. Will definitely be watching this again!
