Definitely not the worst MCU movie but certainly not the best. Some of the acting was cringe worthy most notably Mark Ruffalo. Speaking of him why was Hulk not in the movie for more than 12 seconds??  Tom Holland  may look young which is what a lot of fans wanted for Spider-Man but a better actor should have been cast.  There were so many bad jokes.. Only two things that were surprising and interesting were the use of Stombreaker as Thor's weapon and the post credit scene. Overall this movie is overrated.","displayName":"D P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T21:58:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T22:10:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"976952504","realm":"RT","displayName":"D P","accountLink":"/user/id/976952504"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fantastic! Marvel just keeps getting better and better in my opinion (they’re getting right what Star Wars is failing with - building a great extended universe). This movie was great from beginning to end. The ending leaves you speechless. The character arc of Thanos is complex and enjoyable. You may tear up more than once in the film. Oh, and stay for a scene after ALL credits.

I thought it was really good the special effects and just the movie in general I thought was pretty good. But following it from the original comic book series. Mmmm not so much. My fiance is a die-hard   Marvel fan. And he was just disappointed mainly because it didn't follow the original comic book series story, but liked it for being a movie. But I would definitely recommend to watch.","displayName":"Ramon V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T21:46:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T22:03:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"928027791","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ramon V","accountLink":"/user/id/928027791"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Ótimo roteiro.. colocando cada personagem em um ponto congruente na história(mesmo que uma minúscula parte da história seja forçada) atores e atrizes fantásticos, assim como os efeitos sonoros, visuais e especiais.

I just totally disagree with it.  There are plenty of movies which focus on the harsh realities of the world... movies about superhuman beings flying around and defying the laws of nature are not amongst them.\n\n\nThis movie did an excellent job of jolting me out of the preconceived notion that I was going to the theatre to watch the good guys win, and the bad guys lose... and maybe see some cool action scenes and hear some funny jokes.  Unfortunately, that is what I was going to see!\n\n\nI'm looking forward to the next Marvel movie... so I can decide not to watch it, and instead go to a grown up \"real movie.\"  Thank you Marvel.","displayName":"Dustin W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T21:44:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T20:10:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"899879327","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dustin W","accountLink":"/user/id/899879327"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"}]}
