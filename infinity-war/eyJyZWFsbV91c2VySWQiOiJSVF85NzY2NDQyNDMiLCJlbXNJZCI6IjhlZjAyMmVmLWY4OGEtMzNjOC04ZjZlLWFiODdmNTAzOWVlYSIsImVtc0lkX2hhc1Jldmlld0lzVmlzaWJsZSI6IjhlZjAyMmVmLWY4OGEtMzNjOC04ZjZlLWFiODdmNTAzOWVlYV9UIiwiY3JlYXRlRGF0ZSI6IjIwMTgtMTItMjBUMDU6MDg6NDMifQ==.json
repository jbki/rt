This film is a true monument of film making, it has been built up for over 10 years and it pays off, the chemistry between the Avengers (the heroes) really works and The time most films would use to develop their heroes is used to develop Thanos making him a villain you can understand and sympathise with. Each characters actions and motivations are easily explained by how the are developed in previous films within the MCU. This film also has some of the best action in any comic book film and has many breathtaking visuals including Thanos himself.","displayName":"Sam C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-19T17:28:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-19T17:34:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"977296121","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sam C","accountLink":"/user/id/977296121"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Just when I think Marvel movies are starting to become too formulaic, they drop this gem that brings back all the characters we know and love for an entirely different kind of story.

Balancing this large cast of characters/stars can be incredibly difficult, but somehow they made it look easy here.","displayName":"Brad H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-19T16:19:32.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-19T16:25:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977670248","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brad H","accountLink":"/user/id/977670248"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The Russo Brothers did it.
