Anymore than that I won't say cause it would require spoiling some of the surprises in the movie.\n           just be aware you are gonna be shocked and made to laugh in this well balanced movie.

But I never had to check my watch once to see the total time, and even found myself wondering at the very end if there was any more. More character development than I thought in a jam packed action movie than I thought there would be, especially in regard to Thanos. I could see some very casual MCU fans being upset about having missed a movie or too that left them confused. But as a not casual Marvel fan it was fun to see things I've read in comics or small things in previous movies. I do need to see it at least twice more and let a week go by to let it all sink in properly.","displayName":"Brian D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T11:03:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T11:53:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"977251008","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian D","accountLink":"/user/id/977251008"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"More than many emotional","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1027515117404752/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T10:54:02.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T10:56:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"977251001","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977251001"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best movies I had seen all year","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/302167270319483/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T10:52:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T10:53:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250999","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977250999"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Rating an Avengers Movie out of context of the MCU is pretty ignorant. If you like the MCU or not, it managed to put together a universe on a larger scale than any TV Series and you wouldn't start a TV Series in the last season and expect not to be confused. It's kinda sad that Infinity war gets criticised for being the cumulation of everything that happened before, when that is what makes it great. Infinity War gives its Fans everything they wanted. It's full of Action and humor (that doesn't feel out of place, like in the otherwise great Thor Ragnarok, and therefore doesn't take any impact away from it). It meets our expectations while still surprising us and you actually feel like something's at stake. The Marvel movies are way beyond the point, where you can rate them as standalones without knowing context, especially The Avengers. We don't need build-up and character introductions or development, we got 18 movies of that. It's a great finale and that's what it's supposed to be. In fact, I'm extremely happy that they spared us all these things some critics miss, it would've ruined the whole movie. IMO the best movie of the MCU so far.","displayName":"Fritz S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T10:48:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T11:14:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250990","realm":"RT","displayName":"Fritz S","accountLink":"/user/id/977250990"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"There isnÂ´t much to tell without spoiling the movie but I loved it","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/859091620943878/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T10:47:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T10:48:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"977149255","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977149255"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie as long as you have seen the rest of the series.

We applauded together. We laughed together. We gasped together. We had a lot of fun, for a long time. Then, we saw the credits begin to roll. We sat there in stunned silence, until the post-credit scene played. We filed out of the theater like we were leaving a wake - like we were leaving a battlefield, shell-shocked.\n\n\"I liked that less than I hoped,\" I said to my wife, on the way home. \"I think I feel about this, the way a lot of people felt about The Last Jedi.\"\n\nOn Sunday, I saw it again, with some of my family. We sat on the very back row of a standard theater. The chair was uncomfortable. It was too hot. The sound quality was poor. There was candy and popcorn strewn about from the start - like the staff failed to clean up between screenings. There was a cockroach behind my head, at one point. I killed it with my ballcap. There was less laughter, and no applause. I cried at the end, this time, because my niece cried.\n\nI LOVED the movie, after that screening. I still do. It may be my favorite in the MCU series. Go figure.","displayName":"Dylan N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T10:45:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T10:46:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"905546712","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dylan N","accountLink":"/user/id/905546712"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"}]}
