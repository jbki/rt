I'll make this quick.  It is a cliffhanger, a big one! You might come out of this unsatisfied, but I knew it was coming so I had a great time.  Definitely worth seeing, I only really had one big problem with it but oh well, (Spoiler) They made the Hulk a huge coward, you see him for about two seconds and then poof he is scared of Thanos and never shows again... Seriously Planet Hulk is supposed to be the strongest iteration of the Hulk like he takes out everyone on earth when he comes back and Thanos is supposed to actively avoid fighting the Hulk unless he has to do it but they made him a huge  coward and that annoyed me greatly.  \n\nOther than that I loved the movie and definitely suggest going out and watching it!","displayName":"Jesse M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T20:01:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T20:03:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"928085148","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jesse M","accountLink":"/user/id/928085148"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Comedy was great in in but little to gory for children and  didn't even have Hawkeye in the movie.","displayName":"Aaron C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T20:01:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T20:01:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"977240832","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aaron C","accountLink":"/user/id/977240832"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Glad I did a little homework on the story before going.

Quick climax to action moments where you truly feel as overwhelmed as the events going on. Overall satisfying, pushes you to ask what is next as answers are far from being answered.\nA notable comment is point out how this movie tries largely to patch up Taika Watiti's mess in Thor: Ragnorak with regards to Thor's losses. Would have rathered not hearing the non-sense  of Ragnorak to start with especially it ultimately it is to come undone.\n\nAnyway, one thing is certain, in Avengers 4, the Avengers will go back to the roots and....Assemble.","displayName":"Khalil C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T19:57:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T20:05:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"933140228","realm":"RT","displayName":"Khalil C","accountLink":"/user/id/933140228"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Avengers Infinity War is the best in the MCU.
