It feels kind of half-finished -because technically it is, as the first half of a two-parter- and there are a few minor quibbles and logical flaws. But, seriously, to blend the varying styles of the previous movies, to balance all the characters, to make an over two-and-a-half hour movie that is tightly paced and doesn't drag, has well shot action and humor, and a worthy villain? It is kind of a miracle that this movie is even watchable, let alone good. Well played Marvel, well played.","displayName":"Daniel D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1194862034/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T11:28:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T11:38:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"849041570","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel D","accountLink":"/user/id/849041570"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A compelling storyline, complex villain, and incredible ensemble make for an entertaining and enjoyable ride. This film is packed with jaw-dropping visuals, exciting action, and surprising twists that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats from beginning to end. The film masterfully balances its numerous story arcs and characters to create a true spectacle that has never been done before. One of the true character standouts of the film is Thanos, portrayed by Josh Brolin. Brolin gives a compelling and heart wrenching performance as the film explores the trials and sacrifices Thanos must undergo as he travels the galaxy, hunting the six Infinity Stones. Other commendable performances in the film include Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Tom Holland as Spider-Man, Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, and Chris Pratt as Star-Lord. Alan Silvestri's incredible score adds a deeper layer to the film's story and is truly one of his best yet. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is filled with heart, humor, and sacrifice that help redefine what a hero should be. The Russo brothers have crafted an epic of galactic proportions that will have fans contemplating long after the credits roll","displayName":"Brock A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T11:28:35.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-30T08:49:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"977251036","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brock A","accountLink":"/user/id/977251036"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Ummm.  Pretty underwhelming. (Spoiler Warning!)\n\n1. The pacing was just not good. I get that it must have nbeen difficult to juggle so many characters, but it just didnt work for me. Felt really slow because of the scene jumping without any real overall sense of the passing of time. \n\n2. Superhero levels. A common problem with these superhero meet ups is that individual power levels are so inconsistent. If Thanos boxed up Hulk in the first scene without breaking a sweat, then why would he have any trouble with Starlord, Spider-Man and Iron man when he has MORE infinity stones?\n\n3. No stakes. The \"emotional\" ending of the movie just didn't land for me. I mean, there's no way all those people are really dead for good. I mean there are some of the most popular characters that already have signed on for sequels in the coming years. So, how am I supposedly to really feel a sense of sadness or loss?\n\nOverall, this just isn't that great a movie. Definitely not top 5 in terms of Marvel films.","displayName":"Duke G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T11:25:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T11:25:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"977014682","realm":"RT","displayName":"Duke G","accountLink":"/user/id/977014682"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love this movie canâ€™t wait for part 2!
