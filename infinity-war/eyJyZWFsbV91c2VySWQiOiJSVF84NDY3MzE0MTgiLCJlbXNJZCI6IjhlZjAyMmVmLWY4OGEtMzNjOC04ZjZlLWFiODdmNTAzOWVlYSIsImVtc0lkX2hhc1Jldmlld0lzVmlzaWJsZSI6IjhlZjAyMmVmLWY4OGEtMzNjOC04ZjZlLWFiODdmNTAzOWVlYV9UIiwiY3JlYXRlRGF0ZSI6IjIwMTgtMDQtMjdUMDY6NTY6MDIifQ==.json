Because of the cliffhanger ending i am giving it 4 stars","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1577397009036124/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T06:54:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T07:08:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"977242289","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977242289"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I’m still trying to process the movie but damn it’s so good....","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T06:54:12.845Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T06:54:54.198Z","user":{"userId":"903535530","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/903535530"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wow..  awesome movie..
