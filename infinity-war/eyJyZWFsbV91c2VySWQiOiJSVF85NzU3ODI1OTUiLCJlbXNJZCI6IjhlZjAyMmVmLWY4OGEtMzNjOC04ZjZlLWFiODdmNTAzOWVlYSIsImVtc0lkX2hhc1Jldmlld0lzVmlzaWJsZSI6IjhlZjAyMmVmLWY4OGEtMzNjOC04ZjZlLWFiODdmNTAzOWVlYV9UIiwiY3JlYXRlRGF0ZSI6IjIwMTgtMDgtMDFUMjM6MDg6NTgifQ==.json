And it is interesting, making his journey to conquer the universe the focal point. So, who does one root for? There are so many heroes, 10 years of investment, no, that I, for one, felt a bit conflicted. There was enough excitement to keep me dialed in though, and I thought, \"this is like a fancy meal, and this is only the set-up for the grand finale.\" It better be one hell of a grand finale. And if the Infinity Stone that controls time is used (ala Superman flying around Earth to bring back Lois from the dead) to resolve matters I will feel so cheated.","displayName":"Kevin M.

Seeing all those characters interact with each other is very interesting and the effort and time that Marvel has put into crafting the MCU has really paid off. \"Infinity War\" doesn't feel like 150 minutes crammed with characters and plot threads and that's definitely laudable. I gotta say though not only was the end a shocker but I feel we need to see more before we can truly evaluate it.","displayName":"Petros T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-01T14:05:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-01T14:05:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"904514452","realm":"RT","displayName":"Petros T","accountLink":"/user/id/904514452"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Brilliantly crafted comic book cross-over movie.
