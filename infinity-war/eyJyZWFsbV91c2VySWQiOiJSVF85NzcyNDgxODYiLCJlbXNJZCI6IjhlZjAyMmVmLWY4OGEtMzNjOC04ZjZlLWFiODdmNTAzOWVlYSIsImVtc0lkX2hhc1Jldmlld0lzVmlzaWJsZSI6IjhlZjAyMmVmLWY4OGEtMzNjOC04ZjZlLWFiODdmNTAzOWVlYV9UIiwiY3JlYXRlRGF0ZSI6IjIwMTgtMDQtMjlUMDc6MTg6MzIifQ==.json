Finished Thanos it gives something new to a specifically new marvel villain you dont see in others with of course the unrealistic higher calling and god complex, illogical, disillusions.Which seems to be the only appropriate antagonist for these avengers films.However this movie seems to thrive solely off of character interactions plot purpose and mcguffin conveniences at times leaving it to fall flat in protagonist motivation other than the copy and paste \"we have to save the world\".But solely what keeps this film from falling below in quality is its every accomplishment in a congruent story assembled by cast performances character ability which isnt a new avengers formula but that being said what infinity war does what age of ultron cared not t.That's largely due to character development and improvement or critical decline which were the deciding factors in this film.This movie is a 8.8/10 or 4.6/5 or an 89/100","displayName":"Terra F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T07:04:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T07:33:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"973927544","realm":"RT","displayName":"Terra F","accountLink":"/user/id/973927544"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Wonderful movie.
