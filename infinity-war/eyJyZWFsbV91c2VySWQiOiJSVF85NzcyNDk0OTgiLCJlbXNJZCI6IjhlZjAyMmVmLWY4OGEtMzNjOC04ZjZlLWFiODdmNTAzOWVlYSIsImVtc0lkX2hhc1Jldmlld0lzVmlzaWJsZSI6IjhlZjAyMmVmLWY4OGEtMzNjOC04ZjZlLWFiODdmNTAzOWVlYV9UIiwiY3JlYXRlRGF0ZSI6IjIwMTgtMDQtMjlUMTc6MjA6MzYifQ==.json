The action, humor, and characters are all fantastic. However, the ending ruined the movie. SPOILER ALERT!!! The movie ends with everybody disappearing and Thanos sitting on a throne watching the sun rise. The ending made me realize that the movie is a 2 hour advertisement for the MCU and a 4th Avengers movie. I can't wait for the HISHE about this movie. I hate the movie the more I think about this ending. If you give Disney your money for a ticket, leave before the ending. \n\nP.S. Chris Pratt is the reason the avengers lost.","displayName":"Eric F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T17:19:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T17:22:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977121403","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eric F","accountLink":"/user/id/977121403"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Infinity War delivers the thrills of the first Avenger's movie and balances the action, humour and emotional elements to create a film that is thoroughly enjoyable from the start to the climax of this episode.

It delivers in literally every way. The emotional gut punches are intense, the battle sequences are incredible, the character interactions are hilarious (especially between Tony, The Guardians, and Doctor Strange) and it sets up Avengers 4 to be one of the best endings to a story and one of the best films of all time.

This deters a bit from the comics as Thanos is trying to kill half the universe to balance life itself instead of killing everyone to impress last Death. The humor was well placed and not forced like Star Wars Last Jedi. Many might be upset at the ending but it left me wanting more Marvel.
