The tone is set very early on with the introduction of Thanos who was made into the most intimidating villain in the MCU within the first few minutes. The movie does a great job of balancing all the characters and tones while still fitting in humor and tons of CGI action that doesnâ€™t feel out of place or soft, it still feels dire for the heroes. Overall the best MCU movie to date. 8/10","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T22:32:51.356Z","updateDate":"2019-01-04T07:43:26.186Z","user":{"userId":"976653529","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976653529"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"You will leave the theater with an empty yet satisfied heart.","displayName":"Link L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T22:26:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T11:09:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"919657855","realm":"RT","displayName":"Link L","accountLink":"/user/id/919657855"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Infinity War is a mesmerizingly giant party of superheroes with everything is balanced in writing and acting.

As a whole, this is truly the beginning of the culmination of the last 10 years of Marvel. It excites me to see where Avengers 4 will go, even though I have many theories and also believe that Infinity War setup the end for their first run of Avengers whether that be retirement or... death. Either way, this first half is more like a whole then any part 1 before it. The story has a complete arch and does a great deal to ground Thanos and even make his cause sensible allowing you to feel a bit sympathetic towards it... A bit. All the heroes throughout the passed 10 years have enough time to shine with the exception of a few. But, overall, if you are a fan of the MCU, this movie is everything you've ever wanted even though nack in 2012 we never even saw Avengers coming! How far things have come.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T22:15:21.581Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T15:31:12.682Z","user":{"userId":"842028089","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/842028089"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"}]}
