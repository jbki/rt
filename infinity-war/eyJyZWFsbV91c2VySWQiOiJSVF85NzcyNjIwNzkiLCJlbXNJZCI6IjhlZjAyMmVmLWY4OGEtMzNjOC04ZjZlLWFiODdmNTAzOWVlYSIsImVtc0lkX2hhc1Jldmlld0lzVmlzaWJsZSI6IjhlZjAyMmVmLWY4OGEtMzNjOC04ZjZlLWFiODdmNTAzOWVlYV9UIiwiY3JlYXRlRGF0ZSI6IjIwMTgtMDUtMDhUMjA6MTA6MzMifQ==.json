Why the red herrings by way of superheroes dying was not believable? When did Wanda and Vision start a romance? Why could not Vision with the most powerful stone obliterate Thanos? Yeah yeah I know they had to make the drama move along and sacrifice marvel universe logic for there to be a story to the film but seriously you can’t assume your audience won’t know or understand its Avengers universe lore.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T18:32:44.488Z","updateDate":"2018-05-08T18:32:44.488Z","user":{"userId":"972653330","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/972653330"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"}]}
