Spends so much time bouncing around between characters that no one gets enough screen time despite it being 3 hours long. Thanos is a weak villain, at best, being far less threatening than even low-tier villains in previous movies. All while oscillating wildly between super tough fighter and weaklings with a toy.","displayName":"Jason P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/149145252119863/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-16T20:12:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T20:15:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"972699466","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jason P","accountLink":"/user/id/972699466"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"good character moments.

It was full of surprises and averted my expectations at nearly every turn, the antagonist was interesting and engaging, and I felt an emotional connection to the story and characters like I've never felt in any other MCU movie before it. By far the best MCU movie to date in my opinion.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-16T19:41:51.388Z","updateDate":"2018-05-18T15:40:51.551Z","user":{"userId":"838127785","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/838127785"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome plot development and villain development..Thanos was hard to develop with the time allotted in this film with the many character arcs but it worked out fine.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2004963073124992/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-16T19:37:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T19:39:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"976986643","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976986643"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Best Marvel movie to date","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-16T19:27:02.618Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T19:27:02.618Z","user":{"userId":"260133060","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260133060"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 16, 2018"}]}
