It was a triumph to witness the culmination of a decade of MCU films come together. Main concern being that some chracters didn't perhaps get as much recognition as others. Overall however, this was a Thanos movie no doubt, seeing both his origins and motivations come to light. Definitely worth a watch.","displayName":"Nathan P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-11T20:01:40.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-11T20:05:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"977914573","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nathan P","accountLink":"/user/id/977914573"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Only as good as it is because of what came before it. Like nothing Marvel has put out yet IW is more of an event than an Avengers movie. 2nd to Thanos, the Avengers are mere set pieces in Thanos's character arc. Far more meaningful deaths than i imagined, and sadly more than can be reversed. The first marvel movie with stakes, most of their jokes are out of place here and miss their mark, there are noticeable missing characters, and a few too many shoehorned in. While it has my second favorite moment is the MCU behind Hulk assembling the Avengers in 2012, IW can't avoid feeling like a disappointment despite being everything Age of Ultron should have been. That being said there's not a dull moment in the movie, entertaining from start to finish it cements itself as one of the best in the MCU.","displayName":"Craig F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-11T19:01:46.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-11T19:22:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"907233324","realm":"RT","displayName":"Craig F","accountLink":"/user/id/907233324"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"La trama tiene agujeros muy graves y en ocasiones es ilÃ³gica.","displayName":"Oscar L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-11T17:25:58.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-11T17:27:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"977914099","realm":"RT","displayName":"Oscar L","accountLink":"/user/id/977914099"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Maybe a bit too much thrown into the mix but maintains the high standard of the series.","displayName":"Bill C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001882170581/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-11T17:17:09.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-11T17:18:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"959140737","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bill C","accountLink":"/user/id/959140737"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 11, 2019"}]}
