Im glad they chilled out on the humor. They learned their lesson from ragnorok. I think it was ballsy and very emotional the way it ended. Thanos was a really good villain.

His actions are truly evil, but there's a logical conviction about him that is so endearing.\n\nObviously this is superhero pop at it's finest, but the weight of the events of the film as well as the interpersonal moments with the characters are what sets it firmly among Marvel's best.\n\nThe film isn't without minor details I wish were added, but the sum of it's parts as well as that ending are what earns it 5 stars for me.","displayName":"Justin B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1278187710/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T19:46:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T19:50:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"829896243","realm":"RT","displayName":"Justin B","accountLink":"/user/id/829896243"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Almost perfect in every aspect","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/812557502249666/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T19:44:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T19:45:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"976941651","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976941651"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I guess The MCU and GoT have more than I thought in common.... they both, now have their-own Red Wedding!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T19:41:43.402Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T19:41:43.402Z","user":{"userId":"905120846","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/905120846"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"When I came out of the cinema, I was still wearing the awesomeness glasses but as I started scrutinising the movie more. The flaws became evident. The movie feels rushed and they got alot of the things wrong in it. Thanos is never humane. He doesn't cry and they made the Black Order look like some bunch of cheap villains whereas they are strong enough to take out the Avengers alone. The action was good in some parts but it feels rushed. It tries so hard to be a part one of a movie that it fails to live up being a good movie. Most of the characters are there just for the sake of being there when they don't serve any purpose. It established itself as a spectacle and a spectacle it was and yet when you walk out of the cinema, you feel extremely underwhelmed.","displayName":"Rana S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/514657240/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T19:39:32.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T19:43:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"863208850","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rana S","accountLink":"/user/id/863208850"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"}]}
