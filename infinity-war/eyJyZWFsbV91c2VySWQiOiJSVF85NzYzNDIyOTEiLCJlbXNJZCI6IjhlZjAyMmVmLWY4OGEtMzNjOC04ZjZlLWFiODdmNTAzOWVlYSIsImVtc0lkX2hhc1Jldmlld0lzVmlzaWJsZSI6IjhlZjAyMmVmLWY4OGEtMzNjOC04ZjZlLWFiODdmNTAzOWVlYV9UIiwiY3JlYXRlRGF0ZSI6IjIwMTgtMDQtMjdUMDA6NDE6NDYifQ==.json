I have never felt such an emotional impact from a movie in a long time. Congrats to the Russo Bros for navigating such an emotional weight with this film. It is such a great film that it feels and looks (great cinematography) like a much deeper film (not a comic book movie) with Marvel characters in it. I can't wait for what's next.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10100524560972664/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T00:26:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T00:30:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241443","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977241443"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Avengers: Infinity War - 5 out of 5 - This is a superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. It is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers and 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, and features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Josh Brolin, and Chris Pratt. In Avengers: Infinity War, the Avengers work with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop Thanos from amassing the all-powerful Infinity Stones.\nI gave the film this rating because the story telling and the way the movie brought out the emotions of everyone in the theaters as events were unfolding you would hear collective \"oh my gods\" or people yelling at what's going on. Normally this would be a bad thing, but it just made it even better, made it like everyone were friends hanging out. It is very hard to write this review without giving anything away but this is a film I have been waiting 10 years to see the culmination of the first three phases of the MCU and it did not disappoint.\nI have already seen this film twice I will most likely watch it a few more times. You definitely will want to check this out at your local theater such as your nearest Goodrich Theater. When it is released for home view I would recommend buying it as well.\nFor anyone who has seen this movie let me know your thoughts in the comments below but please remember no spoilers.","displayName":"Matthew R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T00:25:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T22:24:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"977231836","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew R","accountLink":"/user/id/977231836"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's a amazing movie.
