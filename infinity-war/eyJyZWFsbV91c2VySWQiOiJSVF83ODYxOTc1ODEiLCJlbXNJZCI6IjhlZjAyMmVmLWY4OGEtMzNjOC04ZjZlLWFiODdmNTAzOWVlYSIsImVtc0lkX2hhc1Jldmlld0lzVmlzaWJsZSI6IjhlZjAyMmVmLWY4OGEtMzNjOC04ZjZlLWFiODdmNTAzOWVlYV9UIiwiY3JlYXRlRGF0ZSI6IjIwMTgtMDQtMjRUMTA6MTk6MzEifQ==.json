The problem is, of course, that a movie is different than a comic book. With a running time of over 2 hours and 40 minutes, I found myself alternating between boredom, impatience and frustration. Sure, there were bright spots, like every time Bruce Banner fought with his inner demon (Hulk). And all my favorite characters made an appearance. But, overall, I kept waiting to be entertained and constantly disappointed. I wanted something good or interesting to happen. Instead, key characters kept dropping at the hands of Thanos, who could have easily been stopped if someone had simply cut off his arm.\nMovies plots based on such flimsy logic are never my favorites. There simply wasn't enough good stuff to offset all the idiotic plot holes that would allow me to forgive Infinity War for all its flaws. There were a few bright spots, like when Groot helps Thor reforge his hammer. And anytime the Guardians of the Galaxy were on screen I was a happy camper.\nIn my mind, though, I kept imagining what I would have done differently to make Infinity Wars a better, more enjoyable experience. For one thing, I would have split it into three 2-hour movies and ended on a lighter, more fun note. The ending sucked, and I knew it wasn't for real. I felt manipulated. I felt like the movie makers were being nasty and taking the audience for granted. I may not be able to forgive them. They stole three hours from me that I will never get back watching this junked up mess of a film. I ended up liking most of the characters less as a result. And since a whole bunch of them are \"gone\" now, supposedly, I'm not sure whether I care if they ever come back.","displayName":"Scott S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/701208455/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T10:10:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-09T10:30:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"802677598","realm":"RT","displayName":"Scott S","accountLink":"/user/id/802677598"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"\"Avengers: Infinity War\" is both awesome and flawed. Wonder still arise in its imperfection. \"Infinity War\" is The Avengers' catharsis. The visuals dazzle. The battles have never been more spectacular or costly. Despite having way too many superheroes in this 2 hour and 40 minute epic, what compels is villain Thanos, played by powerful sad Josh Brolin.\nGalactic warrior Thanos is the hulking man-like creature, Son of Saturn's Moon Titan. I got what Thanos is about. As a child he witnessed his vibrant Titan die, because of over population. Thus, exhausting its resources. That was his epiphany, his cause. \nHe \"adopts\" daughers Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, and Nebula, played by Karen Gillan, on his merciless conquests across the universe. \nThanos possess the Infinity Gauntlet, the golden mechanical glove with powerful Infinity Stones. When he finds all 6 Infinity Stones, he can wipe out half of humanity in the universe with a snap of his finger. In his own delusional way, be truly believe this is for the greater good. \nAlthough \"Infinity War\" is not greater than \"Black Panther\", it is great. \"Infinity War\" is Act 2 of The Avengers heroic morality play.\n\nChris Hemsworth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Zoe Saldana, and Chris Evans rock as Thor, Doctor Strange, Gamora, and Captain America. Hemsworth is super badass as Thor, who is fueled by vengeance upon Thanos. Cumberbatch is strong and wise as Doctor Strange, who may hold the key to this \"endgame\". Evans is all conviction and earnest idealism as Steve Roger's Captain. Saldana is very powerful in the humanity of her love and hate for her father Thanos.\n\nThat Father-Daughter dynamic resonates above the distracting number of Superheroes and the splintered narratives. So was it worth it for Thanos in the end? Did he get what he truly desired? \"Infinity War\" does surprise in great ways. So it was worth it at least for me. Even with the totally WTF conclusion, I still hold hope. We'll all have to wait for may 2019 to see...","displayName":"Jon O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T10:09:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T15:11:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"952155927","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jon O","accountLink":"/user/id/952155927"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Now i can proudly say that the  10 years wait was worth it .","displayName":"Rahul P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1321234227973080/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T10:05:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T02:26:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"976492099","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rahul P","accountLink":"/user/id/976492099"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Amazing culmination of ten years worth of movies","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T10:00:33.130Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T02:16:19.141Z","user":{"userId":"784270869","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/784270869"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"In my opinion, the worst Marvel movie to date.
