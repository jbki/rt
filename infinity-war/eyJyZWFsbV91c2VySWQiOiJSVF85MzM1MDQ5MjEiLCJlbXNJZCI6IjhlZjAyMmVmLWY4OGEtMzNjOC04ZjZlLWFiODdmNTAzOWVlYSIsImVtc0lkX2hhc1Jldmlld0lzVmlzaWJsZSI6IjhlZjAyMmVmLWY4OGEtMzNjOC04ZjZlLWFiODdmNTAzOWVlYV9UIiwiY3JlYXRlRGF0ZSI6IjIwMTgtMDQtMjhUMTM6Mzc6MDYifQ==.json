The inevitable problem is that the wider it goes, the shallow it gets. The characters' arcs are obvious from the get-go, and we end up with plenty of repeated beats, jokes and themes (even if some are quite funny and emotionally resonant). Although there are exciting set pieces, they often run long and offer little we haven't yet seen. Still, most troubling, is how unimaginative the outer space worlds are. When a studio has hundreds of millions of dollars and produces visuals that are anything less than spectacular, something's amiss. Despite these glaring and disappoint flaws, it's impossible to deny Infinity War's scope, something that will be very hard to replicate.","displayName":"Filipe C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1628943418/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T13:35:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T13:35:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"876741169","realm":"RT","displayName":"Filipe C","accountLink":"/user/id/876741169"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What an amazing display of story telling and actions packed together.

If you don't get it then you don't know the comics or you haven't been watching all the previous films! Or you clearly don't  have the intelligence to watch this kind of film.  \nIf you want to watch a drama go watch some crap like Dunkirk or if you feel more comfortable with being spoon fed reviews that have been bought watch wonder  woman.  This is a good film but you have to know the history to appreciate it and once you do you'll appreciate that they have been working  towards this film series for 10 years!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/171455330347299/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T13:27:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T13:33:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246414","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977246414"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
