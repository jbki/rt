If I have to criticize any part, I would say it seemed a little rushed in the 1st half. That's however understandable given all they had to cover. They still did a good job with it...and the 2nd half was outstanding.\nThe comedy was well placed, there was genuine emotion like the last scene with Peter Parker, and there were cheer-out-loud moments like Thor arriving on earth. Character interactions between avengers that had never previously met were perfectly written.  Right off the bat, Thanos was made out to be a villain that had to be taken seriously, while at the same time, given a bit of background and story arc - cough snoke cough-\nLucasfilm needs to watch this movie a dozen times and take notes. Yes, you can be different and bold while still staying true to previously established characters and movie lore to give fans a movie they like. It CAN  be done. You don't have to destroy everything that came before. Yes you can have strong female characters that are well written(Gamora, Scarlett Witch, Black Widow, etc) and given good character arcs without having to shoehorn them in.","displayName":"Greg J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-09T16:36:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-09T16:36:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"977029950","realm":"RT","displayName":"Greg J","accountLink":"/user/id/977029950"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Avengers: Infinity War is a full emotional ride, with majestic visual and action pieces, as well as a varied and well-balanced mix of tones. It also involves great storytelling as the story forces the characters to take hard decisions that affect the plot.

It had that rare blend of humor and being serious.There are parts in the movie that I think would be better to not have or change. For example, the length of the movie.
