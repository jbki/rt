This is by far my favorite from the franchise as it shows the potential that all of the heros have even with their fatidic ending. The Russo brothers once again delivered a great film that is very much worth watching.

Not one beloved character is overlooked, and they all manage to blend together will excellent humour and pacing. Each moment makes sense to the story and is properly done in the overall appeal of things. The end tugs at your heart strings. The perfect setup of the finale of twenty two movies.","displayName":"Parker W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-05-25T22:33:14.864Z","updateDate":"2019-05-25T22:33:14.864Z","user":{"userId":"978073258","realm":"RT","displayName":"Parker W","accountLink":"/user/id/978073258"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Surprisingly an actual good superhero movie.
