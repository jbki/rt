The  performance of Josh Brolin is what made this movie possible.  Sure, out favorite characters do not disappoint, and the teaming of Rockit /Thor,  and Starlord/Srange/Spiderman is worth the price of admission alone.  But it is Thanos who is the glue that binds them all in their heroism, sacrifice, pain and despair .  Although the unparalled cgi and action scenes serve as a reminder how poorly formed Justice League really was, I found myself hanging on the \"slow\"  scenes where Brolin brought Thanos to life.  At times I found myself sympathizing, even rooting for him.  I went back to the \"ant-boot comment in the first film: ants will fight to live but sometimes they just need to die, and so it was with my heroes.  My only complaint is the ending because I fear some sort of \"magical  resurrection\" or time reset vis  a vis  the comic world that will render it meaningless.  We can only wait for the arrival of Capt Marvel in  to find out.  See this movie again and again, revel in it because it's a moment in movie history that we may never see again.","displayName":"Joseph L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000025117603/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T18:57:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T19:34:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"882234096","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph L","accountLink":"/user/id/882234096"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Actually pretty funny","displayName":"Finn M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T18:55:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T18:56:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"977153158","realm":"RT","displayName":"Finn M","accountLink":"/user/id/977153158"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Felt like I was in a 3 hour DC movie-- under delivered.
