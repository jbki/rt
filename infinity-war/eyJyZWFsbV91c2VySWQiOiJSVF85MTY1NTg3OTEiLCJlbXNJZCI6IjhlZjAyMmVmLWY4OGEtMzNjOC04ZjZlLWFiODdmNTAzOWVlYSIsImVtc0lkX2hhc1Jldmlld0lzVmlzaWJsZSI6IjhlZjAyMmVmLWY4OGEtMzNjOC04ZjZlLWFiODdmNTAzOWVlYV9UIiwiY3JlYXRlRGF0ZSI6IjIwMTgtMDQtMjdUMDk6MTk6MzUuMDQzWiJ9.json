Los planes fallan, el personaje falla, incluso los sacrificios fallan. No es exactamente refrescante, pero es vigorizante e incluso gratificante.\" Quizás sea la crítica en un aspecto cinéfilo que más se acerca a lo que pienso.\nMarvel por fin da al público lo que llamamos una muy buena \"adaptación del cómic\" a la pantalla grande, un toque de realidad y que no siempre se va a tener un final donde todos ganamos. Un final que un fan sólo del UCM no se esperaría. \nAl ver la película sentí la gran esencia del cómic de The Infinity Gauntlet, ver la presión, los sacrificios, las forma de pelear, los diálogos entre los personajes y la manera en la que empiezan a entenderse es algo que no veía desde Avengers. Ese tipo de emoción o \"hype\" no lo sentía desde la primera película de Iron Man e incluso Avengers. Simplemente un gran éxito el cuál me hace admirar y reconocer a Marvel tanto como lo hago con DC. ¡Joyón de película!

His character development is absolutely incredible.  Never in a million years could I possibly imagine that a CGI character could be this compelling.\n\nNot only was his CGI flawless, and above reproach in terms aesthetics, but his character development ranks him as one of the best MCU villains of all time.\n\nSome of the most memorable MCU villains popping into my head right now are \n\nLoki from Avengers.  \nErik Killmonger from Black Panther.\n\nJosh Brolin as Thanos, despite being a CGI character ranks up there with the best of the MCU villains of all time, in my humble opinion.\n\nI also love the fact that the most beloved heroes of the MCU were given the opportunity to shine as well.  I didn't feel like any of them were upstaged.\n\nThis movie is 2 and a half hours, and it doesn't feel like it at all.  It goes by fast.  No pacing issues.  Every single minute of this movie either serves the plot, or the character development.  Not a single minute wasted.\n\nI'm utterly amazed at how Marvel never seems to drop the ball..... ever.\n\nI was so glad that Roger Ebert was alive long enough to give a review for the second installment of the Christopher Nolan's trilogy: \"The Dark Knight\"\n\nRoger Ebert felt that the Dark Knight transcended the comic book movie genre.\n\nHis exact words:\n\n\"Batman\" isn't a comic book anymore. Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" is a haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy.\n\nThe Infinity War kinda makes me wish Roger Ebert was still alive.  I wonder if he would feel the same about the Infinity War transcending the comics as well.","displayName":"Voltaire A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T09:11:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T10:40:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"909099701","realm":"RT","displayName":"Voltaire A","accountLink":"/user/id/909099701"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best marvel movie to date","displayName":"Eduardo G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T09:11:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-27T22:49:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"910751062","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eduardo G","accountLink":"/user/id/910751062"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
