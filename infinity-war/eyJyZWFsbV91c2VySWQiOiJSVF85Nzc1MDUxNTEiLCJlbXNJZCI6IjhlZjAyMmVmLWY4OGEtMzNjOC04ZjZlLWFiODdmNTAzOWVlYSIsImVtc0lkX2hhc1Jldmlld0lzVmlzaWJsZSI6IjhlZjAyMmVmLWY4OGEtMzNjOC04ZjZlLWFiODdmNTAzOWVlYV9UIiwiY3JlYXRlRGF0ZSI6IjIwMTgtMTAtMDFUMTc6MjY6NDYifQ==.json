Juggles multiple story arcs incredibly well, with a good dose of entertaining, sometimes slightly forced humor. The only complaint being to fully understand the film, you must have done your research on the previous films and the meaningless superhero films with no purpose are not my cup of tea, however, I was pleased to find that Thanos is a 10/10 villian, who introduces topics relevant and thought provoking, wrapped in a fun, super powered package.","displayName":"Alexia R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-30T21:45:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-30T21:50:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"977503907","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alexia R","accountLink":"/user/id/977503907"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"it is the best movie i have ever seen i love the battles and i loved the villain his cause was understandable and i liked that he would do anything to get all the stones","displayName":"Cooper C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-30T07:48:41.000Z","updateDate":"2019-07-14T12:56:47.749Z","user":{"userId":"977502570","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cooper C","accountLink":"/user/id/977502570"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Perfect in all aspects","displayName":"Bob B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-30T07:10:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-30T07:11:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"977432544","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bob B","accountLink":"/user/id/977432544"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Highly engaging, great performance delivered over a highly loaded storyline with more subplots then a normal Marvel movie of any kind! It was a hard one to pull of but they did it. I look forward to the 2nd part fo this 2 parter given its main storyline's ending setting up the part 2. Its a must see for a Marvel fan and entertaining for just about anyone else who remotely likes Sci Fi or Fantasy genres of movie making.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1985695065031328/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-30T04:57:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-30T05:00:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977004331","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977004331"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Awesome f**king movie, very emotional at the end, still wish they didn't kill Spider-man.
