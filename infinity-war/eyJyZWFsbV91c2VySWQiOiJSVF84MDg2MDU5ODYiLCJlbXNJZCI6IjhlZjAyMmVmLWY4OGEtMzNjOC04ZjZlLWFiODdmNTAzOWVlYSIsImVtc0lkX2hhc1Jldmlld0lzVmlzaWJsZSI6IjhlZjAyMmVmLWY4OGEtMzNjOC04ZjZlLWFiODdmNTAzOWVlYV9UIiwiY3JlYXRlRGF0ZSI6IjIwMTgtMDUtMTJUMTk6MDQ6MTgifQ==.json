Yes, I fucking loved this movie that much. This is basically everything a Marvel comic book fan could hope for in a crossover movie this size. Fuck...the fact that this movie exists should be an achievement in itself! How the fuck does anyone produce a movie with 20+ characters from different branches of its universe and have all their stories somehow tie together? The Russo brothers are fucking geniuses. They need to be awarded some kinda achievement award for this 'cause the Oscars sure as hell wouldn't give this best picture or screenplay. This movie had me go through all kinds of different emotions - it's a fucking roller coaster ride if you're hugely invested in the MCU characters.\n\nThat said, this isn't a flawless movie though. There were times the CGI was pretty obvious and with this many characters, a few get the short stick in this - although I am confident they'll get to shine in A4.\n\nIf you haven't seen this movie, wtf are you doing???
