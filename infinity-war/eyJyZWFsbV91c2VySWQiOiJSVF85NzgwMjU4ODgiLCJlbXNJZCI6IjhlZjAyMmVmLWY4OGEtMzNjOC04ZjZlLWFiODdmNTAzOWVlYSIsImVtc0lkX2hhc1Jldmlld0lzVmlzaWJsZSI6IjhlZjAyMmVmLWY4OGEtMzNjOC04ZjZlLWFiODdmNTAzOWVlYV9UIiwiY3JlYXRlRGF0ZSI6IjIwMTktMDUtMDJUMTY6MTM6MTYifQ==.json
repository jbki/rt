We get a good villain with a noble goal but horrifying means to achieve it and some very nice action sequences. However except for the villain the entire movie has almost no depth it is an action sequence after another action sequence with a few fillers. The ending of the movie was extremely predictable. The decision making of some of our heroes was so stupid i almost left the cinema back in 2018 and i had to pause the movie when rewatching it. Vision is absolutely useless, even though he's comopsed of  2 great minds vibranium and an infinity stone. Sadly these flaws ruined the movie for me.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2118797008236616/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-05-01T03:43:39.000Z","updateDate":"2019-05-01T03:50:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"977934670","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977934670"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It does very well for itself even though this is basically half of a movie. It smartly splits up the heroes up to create humorous and emotional groups while building it up for a dramatic finish.
