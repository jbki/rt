Thanos was first introduced to us six years ago when the first Avengers film hit theatres in May of 2012. It's hard to believe that time has gone by that quickly, but it has, and Thanos is here. Six years of build up and this movie not only lived up to the hype, but it surpassed all expectations. This movie was full of laughs, fun, action, and quite a few emotional gut punches to go along with it. From the get go the audience comes to realize that Thanos is the biggest baddest villain to ever face the Avengers in the MCU. This movie will have you cheering, laughing, and possibly even crying. The ending was phenomenal. It will leave you frustrated and satisfied at the same time. This movie was built up for six years and well worth the wait.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1796968723940106/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T11:57:02.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T12:04:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"976928799","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976928799"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Very Depressing Movie.  This is not a feel good movie.  Gave it 3 stars for the acting, great special effects, etc. but part of the movie rating is if you liked the movie or not.  I did not.  I watch movies to get away from all the bad news in the world, lol.  Last thing I wanted to hear was more bad news, even if it was make believe.  First weekend should be good box office but time the word gets out this is an incredible downer movie, it might fall off quickly.","displayName":"John B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T11:56:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T12:00:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"976938223","realm":"RT","displayName":"John B","accountLink":"/user/id/976938223"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"10 years of hype and totally delivered","displayName":"Falah H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T11:55:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T11:56:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"911311367","realm":"RT","displayName":"Falah H","accountLink":"/user/id/911311367"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Storyline is atrocious and all over the place.  They appear to disregard the build up of some of the characters and the ending is terrible.  They kill 1/2 of the cast only to let you know they are coming back.  You don't even want to emotionally engage with the movie.  Have tried to post this review multiple times and it won't let me.  Wonder if that is because it is not a high review.???","displayName":"Re W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T11:54:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T12:00:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248792","realm":"RT","displayName":"Re W","accountLink":"/user/id/977248792"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely amazing movie","displayName":"Callum S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T11:49:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T11:50:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248784","realm":"RT","displayName":"Callum S","accountLink":"/user/id/977248784"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Having collected and poured over Marvel comics throughout my young life I have been blown away to see one of the most pivotal Marvel stories brought to the big screen, nearly seamlessly tied to the previous 18 Marvel MCU films and come through the experience only wanting MORE!
