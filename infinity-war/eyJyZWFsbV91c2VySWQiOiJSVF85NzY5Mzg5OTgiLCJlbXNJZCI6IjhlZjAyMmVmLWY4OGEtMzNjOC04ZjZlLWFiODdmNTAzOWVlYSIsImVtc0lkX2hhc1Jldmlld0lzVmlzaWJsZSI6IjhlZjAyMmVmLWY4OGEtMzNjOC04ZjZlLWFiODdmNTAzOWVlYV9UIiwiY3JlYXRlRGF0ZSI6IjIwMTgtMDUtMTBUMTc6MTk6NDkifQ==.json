First off, I don't dissect every scene as much as I just look at the big picture. And, man oh man, is this a big picture. \n\nIn seeing Thanos' few cameos in the previous MCU films I felt he was way too cartoonish. Thanos looked more like the father of the California Raisins more than a big bad villain. \"Infinity War\" ended that POV rather quickly. This is one dynamic escape from the hate filled world we live in today. I have very little to snivel about. I felt The Guardians were made to look like clowns more often than not but that just gave The Russo's more to work with when it came to the comic relief. The balance between action, SciFi & humor is well balanced. When I watched it the first time I thought the ending was an \"over the top\" cliffhanger. Upon 2nd viewing I realized the ending simply gives us so much more to anticipate in Av4. It also gives the directors somewhat of a blank canvas to work with in the next movie.\n\nI use to think that by killing off some of the original heroes would be a terrible idea & I'd need a little therapy but with each new hero they introduce to us, they rarely disappoint. Sadly we may be saying goodbye to some of our current heroes but I see now that simply means a new hero is waiting in the wings to take us a on new thrill ride.","displayName":"Chuck I","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-10T16:12:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-10T16:59:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"977263921","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chuck I","accountLink":"/user/id/977263921"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"THIS IS THE BEST MARVEL FILM IVE EVER SEEN SINCE CAPTAIN AMERICA CIVIL WAR.üëç","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-10T15:53:52.666Z","updateDate":"2018-05-25T19:17:22.751Z","user":{"userId":"260129983","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260129983"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Some are saying this is the best movie, ever? Meh......bigger doesn't mean better. Way too unfocused; far too mamy characters to actually care about most of them.
