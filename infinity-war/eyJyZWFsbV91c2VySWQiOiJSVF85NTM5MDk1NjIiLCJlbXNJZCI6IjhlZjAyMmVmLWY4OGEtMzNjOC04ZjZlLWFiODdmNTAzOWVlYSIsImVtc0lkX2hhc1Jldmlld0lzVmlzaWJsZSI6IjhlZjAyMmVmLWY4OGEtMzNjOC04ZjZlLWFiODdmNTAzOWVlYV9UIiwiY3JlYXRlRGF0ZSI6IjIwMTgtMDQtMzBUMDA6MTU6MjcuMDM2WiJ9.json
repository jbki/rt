Stan Lee and his comic book universe has now replaced Shakespeare, Tolstoy and Sophocles??? Instead of a fun filled - which the first half was- I got a lecture (and a lame one at that ) delivered in a disturbingly non-entertaining way. Go back to the childrenâ€™s superhero story that got you here in the first place.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T00:13:01.097Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T00:13:01.097Z","user":{"userId":"914012899","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/914012899"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"sadly I can only do just 5 stars NEED MORE STARS","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T00:10:10.702Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T00:10:10.702Z","user":{"userId":"260105605","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260105605"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Something you could never imagine...","displayName":"Kamila B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T00:08:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T00:09:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250141","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kamila B","accountLink":"/user/id/977250141"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Completely shocking and satisfying.

I loved the movie, the story was paced well, and the connection between some characters was amazing. I am slightly angry due to the ending, but I did see it coming. This was Thanos's arch and was his story. It only made sense. Tom Holland did an amazing performance as Spider-Man, as well as Robert Downey Jr as Iron man. But I have to give it to Josh Brolin who was just perfect as Thanos. His presence in every scene was heavy, his voice showed subtle emotion, while his face with the cgi just brought the titan to life. Honestly this is my new favorite movie even beating my all time favorite... the original Jurassic park.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/435232863567332/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T00:00:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T00:07:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"977179894","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977179894"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Movies that are hyped up  at this level  usually end up disappointing the viewers. Infinity War is one of the few movies that live up to the hype. The movie does an amazing job at building Thanos' personality.  After all, Thanos is the only new main character you see. So, most viewers already have a connection with the other characters. The movie makes good use of this connection most viewers have to the protagonists.","displayName":"Ananthan N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10207435230894064/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T23:59:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T00:05:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"974528188","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ananthan N","accountLink":"/user/id/974528188"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Probably one of my favourite movies ever.","displayName":"Agastya B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T23:57:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T23:58:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250126","realm":"RT","displayName":"Agastya B","accountLink":"/user/id/977250126"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"this movie was amazing while having it's moments of humor it was still a very Intense movie.
