It is long, but doesn't feel as long as it is.   \n\nThere is a LOT going on -- tons of characters and lots of plot lines going on simultaneously in multiple places.  It actually felt a bit like some of the Star Wars movies in this way.  But it never felt confusing or like too much.\n\nI really applaud them for having the courage to make some hard decisions in the movie (no spoilers here), but it definitely isn't the typical movie you'd expect.\n\nOne of the things that I hate about a lot of super hero movies (like maybe the Transformer movies) is that you have basically infinite power people combatting infinite power people and it just isn't interesting.   They did a good job at making the Avengers mortal and able to be defeated\n\nI also really applaud how they were able to bring so many different franchises (Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers, Black Panther, Thor, Spiderman, etc.) all together into a single coherent plot line.\n\nOverall enjoyable.","displayName":"Eric R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T15:01:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T15:05:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"888746527","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eric R","accountLink":"/user/id/888746527"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"7 out of 10...

This really sucked. The huge campaign against spoilers was not to protect some huge epic story line, but rather overused tropes and a lack of heart. And their attempts of making Thanos sympathetic were pathetic and endorse abusive behavior.  And btw Marvel, you don't kill off one of your most iconic and popular characters in the first ten minutes after two minutes of screen time.","displayName":"Katie M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10153151143726424/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T15:01:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T15:03:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"972513342","realm":"RT","displayName":"Katie M","accountLink":"/user/id/972513342"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"i really liked the movie because everyone excpected the good guys to win","displayName":"govand r","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T14:59:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T15:00:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246585","realm":"RT","displayName":"govand r","accountLink":"/user/id/977246585"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A must see for all marvel fans.

There was only one piece of character development I could spot and that was from Doctor Strange but even then it couldn't be considered as character development as he obviously had some ulterior motives. And there was the plot holes. So many plot holes. Why not remove Thanos's arm? Why didn't Thanos just use the Power Stone to wipe out half the universe? And another thing about wiping out civilastions. Why did he destroy the Asgardians? Couldn't he have just done the thing that he did with Gamora's planet and save half of them? Honestly, I found it a complete mess but the acting and effects did make up for the plot in my opinion.","displayName":"Quinn A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T14:57:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T15:03:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246582","realm":"RT","displayName":"Quinn A","accountLink":"/user/id/977246582"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great movie with action, great story line and the way of telling it.
