Thanos is played wonderfully and is extremely likeable. So much so that you actually feel understanding for his plight which upon further consideration is rather idiotic. The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy meshed together nicely and the film was fast paced and entertaining. Besides the villain's reasoning the only thing bad that can be said about the movie is not enough Loki.","displayName":"Bret H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/780748877/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-29T09:07:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-29T09:13:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"897719561","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bret H","accountLink":"/user/id/897719561"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"So Good! awesome movie, funny, amazing action scenes I loved it.
