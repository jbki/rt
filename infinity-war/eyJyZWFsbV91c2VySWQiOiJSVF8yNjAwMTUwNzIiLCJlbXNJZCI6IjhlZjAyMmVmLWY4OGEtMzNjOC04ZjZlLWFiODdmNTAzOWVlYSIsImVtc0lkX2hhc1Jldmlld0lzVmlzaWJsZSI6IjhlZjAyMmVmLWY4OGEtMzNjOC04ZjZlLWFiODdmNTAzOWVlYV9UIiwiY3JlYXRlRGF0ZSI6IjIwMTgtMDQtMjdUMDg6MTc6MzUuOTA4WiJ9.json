The different heroes and worlds come together beautifully, the character chemistry works most of the time, and it manages to be comedic, without feeling light hearted, cheesy, or taking away from the brooding  atmosphere. Unlike any past MCU movies, this film was unafraid to take risks, and throw the unexpected at you, which truly made it great.","displayName":"Alex C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T08:17:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T15:00:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"917183155","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex C","accountLink":"/user/id/917183155"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wow!

The movie is more of a Thanos movie rather than a Avengets movie but the screentime each characters has is truely amazing and gets the best out of everyone.

Evident in Winter Soldier and Civil War. Here they took on the mammoth task of not only a new Avengers movie, but including all members in the current MCU from Spiderman, Black Panther and the Guardians of the Galaxy with only a few previous members omitted, but mentioned in script.\nThe directors cleverly gave all the Avengers their own time to shine without having everyone fighting on screen in the same battle together. This shift really helps the film speed along without slowing the pace. The 149min runtime flies by. Anyone checking their watch has clearly wandered into the wrong film\nI recommend that people who are yet to see the film should avoid anything that would spoil things. The films biggest impacts should be left for the surprise and shock you won't see coming. This is easily the best Marvel film to date. I could not recommend it anymore. 10/10","displayName":"John G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T08:13:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T08:13:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"976862835","realm":"RT","displayName":"John G","accountLink":"/user/id/976862835"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"very epic movie, it`s awesome","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1915458028745285/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T08:12:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T08:13:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"977242485","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977242485"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
