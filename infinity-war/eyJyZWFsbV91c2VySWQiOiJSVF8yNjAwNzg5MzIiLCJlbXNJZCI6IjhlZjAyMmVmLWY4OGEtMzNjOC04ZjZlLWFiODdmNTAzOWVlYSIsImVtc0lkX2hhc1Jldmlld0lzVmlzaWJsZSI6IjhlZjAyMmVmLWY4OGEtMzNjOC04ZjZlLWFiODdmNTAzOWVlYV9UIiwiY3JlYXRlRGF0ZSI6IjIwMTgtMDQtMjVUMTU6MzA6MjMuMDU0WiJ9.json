This movie has a lot of action and intense scenes but the story telling could been a little better but it's worth to watch with the family!\nIt connects all the marvel movies to one! I got to tell this to the cast and everyone who is involved in this movie did a really great job in this movie and I'm glad I went to see it!!\n\nLOVE YOU MARVEL, KEEP IT GOING!!","displayName":"Ryan H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100003881796338/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T14:54:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T20:40:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"941036478","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan H","accountLink":"/user/id/941036478"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The past 10 years paid off.

They have succeeded. This movie feels like a marathon, it hits the ground running and doesn't stop for a breather until \"that thing happens\" in the final few minutes. The only downside to this is that moments where there should be pause, there is very little. Some breathtaking visuals. Some unexpected throwbacks to previous instalments. There were some seven where my 14 year old self was completely thrown back to the source material. The Russo brothers must have the infinity gauntlet because they bought he comics to life.\n\nAfter the multiple disappoints of the DC franchise I allowed myself to buy into the hype. I was not disappointed this is better than any comic book movie that's come before.","displayName":"Danny G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1225630180/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T14:32:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-25T14:42:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"875811217","realm":"RT","displayName":"Danny G","accountLink":"/user/id/875811217"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I caught this opening day and for some reason my review disappeared from the site. This film has that epic scope but never hits the heights predicted by the millions of fanboys in the world. The idea Thanos was going to overcome every single comic book hero was a tough task, they manage to make the threat real by alienating characters but in the end it's a giant tease, the sequel was already announced for May 2019. It was nice seeing all the characters sharing the screen and phase one managed to create a lot of groundwork for this very film to exist. I will reserve my verdict until video but this film was good but far from great for me. The film has that cliff-hanger moment that is going to be solved in the next film, you just know that leaving the cinema. My biggest issues with Marvel are the lack of sacrifice, a film of this scope feels like everybody will be around for the next film. Was it worth the 10 year build up? In some ways yes but ultimately no, it's just another solid action film. I'm now waiting for video before reviewing again. 25/04/2018.","displayName":"Brendan N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T14:29:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-04T15:04:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"909990449","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brendan N","accountLink":"/user/id/909990449"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My new favorite movie this one was a blast the coolest thing ever. The movie had a perfect balence of jokes, action, diolog, dramma, and romance. almost everything in this movie was an awsomely well done unpredictable suprise. Gammora dieing was sad due too the fact that she is an esential part of Gaurdians of the galaxy and she is my favorite femmal super hero, and even her death was done perfectly and helped make the story better. Thanose was the best Marvle villian of all time and maby even the best Superhero villian of all time he was so cool and Iso whanted him to have a one on one with the hulk and he did. This movie was defenatly the combination of tbe last 18 films, from referances to places, characters, and relationships. I was suprised and happy that pretty much everyone died except for the original Avengers, Tony, Thor, Cap, Black widow, and   Bruce Banner, ect... Why I was so happy for this is because we know most of the Gaurdians have to come back to life for vol.3 Spider-man has a sequel, and odds are Doctor Strange and Black Panther will have sequels as well. So now we get all the original avengers in the fourth Avengers movie where they will most likly die and the new characters will be resurected. I cant wait for Captian Marvle and Avengers 4 .","displayName":"Luke R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T14:29:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T13:27:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"977238077","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luke R","accountLink":"/user/id/977238077"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie all the way threw, laughter, action, and also great story.....","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T14:24:34.263Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T23:21:01.199Z","user":{"userId":"918352687","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/918352687"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"so sad but amazing in the top best too sad ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T14:21:27.581Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T00:15:16.531Z","user":{"userId":"976266976","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976266976"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The entire movie I was ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜­","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T14:04:29.059Z","updateDate":"2018-08-06T00:51:37.652Z","user":{"userId":"976394963","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976394963"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"}]}
