As a fan of Marvel movies, I was nervous that it would not live up to expectations, but I am so pleased to say that not only did it meet my expectations, it exceeded them.\nHaving so many strong personalities in the Marvel movies, from Tony Stark, to Peter Quill, to Stephen Strange, I was nervous that they wouldnt balance the personalities well and it would just be a big mess. But part of what makes Infinity War so great is the success in balancing these interactions, making it feel like theyd always been together. Every member of the Avengers, along with Guardians get their own time on screen to shine, whether its in a great action sequence, or making the audience laugh with one liners. \nThe action takes center stage in the movie, but they have balanced it perfectly with humour. With 3-4 different storylines going on at some points too, it would have been very easy for the film to be confusing but they all follow each other very well and the directors have done a fantastic job with the flow of the movie. \nSpoiler Ahead. Some people will likely complain about aspects of the movie, for example the lack of the Hulk being present in the movie, but this was a perfect addition to the movie since it shows the power of Thanos in his capability of besting the hulk, something the hulk has never experiences and shows fear of fighting again. This is something I am sure will be addressed again, or even if the hulk can be presumed dead, the fight with Thanos is certainly an epic way to go out.\nAvengers Infinity War is full of action, humour and sadness, with likely the best MCU Villain ever portrayed, I have never experienced a silent movie theater at the end of a movie before, everyone was simply speechless and at the end of the credits applause showed that it was for the right reasons.  Will definitely will be seeing again in the theater and eagerly awaiting the release of BluRay.","displayName":"Lee A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T16:22:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T16:37:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243801","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lee A","accountLink":"/user/id/977243801"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Even though this is “Marvel” this isn’t a kid movie by all means ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T16:21:53.335Z","updateDate":"2018-06-29T22:22:24.403Z","user":{"userId":"260053240","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260053240"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best marvel movie so far","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/393575567714842/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T16:21:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T16:22:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243797","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977243797"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Still processing the movie.
