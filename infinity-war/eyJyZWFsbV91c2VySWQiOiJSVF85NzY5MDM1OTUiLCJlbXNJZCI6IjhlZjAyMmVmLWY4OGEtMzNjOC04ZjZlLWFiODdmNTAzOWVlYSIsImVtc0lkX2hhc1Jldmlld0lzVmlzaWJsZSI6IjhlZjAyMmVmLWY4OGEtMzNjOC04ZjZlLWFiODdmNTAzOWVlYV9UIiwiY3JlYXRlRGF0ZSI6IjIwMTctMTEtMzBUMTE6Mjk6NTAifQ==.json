The comedy feels natural and not out of place. It also makes a different experience by making a movie about a villain (yes, this is actually Thanos's movie). It is also very dark, unpredictable and it has great writing. It is very well directed, the score is great, the actors are fantastic and don't even get me started on the special effects. It also gives most of the characters their own moment. This is the culmination of 10 years worth of movies, experiences and success. As I stated earlier, in my opinion this is one of the best movies ever made and anyone should watch it,","displayName":"Andres R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-11-30T11:20:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-21T10:55:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"976903579","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andres R","accountLink":"/user/id/976903579"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it! can't wait for pt2!

But other than that, I really enjoyed infinity war. The film did a great job balancing out the many characters that were in the film, and they were all just as great as they were in previous films, the action is plentiful, and a lot of fun to boot, and the film is very suspenseful and had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. It's definitely worth checking out. But it's very clear that it's part 1 of a 2 part film.","displayName":"Michael P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-11-29T13:29:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-02T12:02:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"976902250","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael P","accountLink":"/user/id/976902250"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2017"}]}
