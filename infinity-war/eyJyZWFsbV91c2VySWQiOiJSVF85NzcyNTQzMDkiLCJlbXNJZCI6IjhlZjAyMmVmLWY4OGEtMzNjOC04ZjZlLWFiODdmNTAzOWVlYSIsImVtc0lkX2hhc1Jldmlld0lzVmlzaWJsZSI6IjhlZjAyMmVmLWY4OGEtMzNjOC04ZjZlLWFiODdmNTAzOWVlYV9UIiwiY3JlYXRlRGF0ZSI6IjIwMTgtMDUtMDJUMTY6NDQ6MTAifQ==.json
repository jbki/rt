Thanos was done well, finally a Marvel villain who has more character depth than just sheesh one liners and jokes. Was hoping it'd be as epic as everyone says but it didn't quite live up to the hype. Some moment we're really great and heavy but majority of the film was underwhelming.","displayName":"Joshua S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/873495352781616/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T16:29:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T16:32:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"975124314","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joshua S","accountLink":"/user/id/975124314"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"not funny but still a damn good movie","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T16:13:07.628Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T16:13:07.628Z","user":{"userId":"974891960","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/974891960"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Avengers Infinity War   4/5  Stars\n-No Spoilers Here-\nTHANOS.

Saying that a lot happens in this movie is an understatement! Aside from a few pacing issues, I loved it! Marvel took a huge risk trying too cram so many characters and situations into a 2.5 hour movie! I felt like some of the characters didn't get quite enough attention compared to others, but it was still really fun to watch how different heroes interacted with each other. This film was an emotional roller coaster by providing some of the funniest jokes from the MCU so far while also upping the stakes for some truly emotional, heart-wrenching losses. Thanos is definitely the strongest villain from the franchise, both in strength and in characterization. And the fight scenes are absolutely epic! The entire film is full of non-stop action that leaves you full and overwhelmed by the end, but it also leaves you wanting more after a finale that completely changes the superhero movie formula!","displayName":"Chris S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T15:50:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-30T16:34:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"547461616","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris S","accountLink":"/user/id/547461616"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Striking and entertaining from start to finish.","displayName":"Kevin M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T15:40:00.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T15:40:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"977254245","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kevin M","accountLink":"/user/id/977254245"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"By far the best Marvel movie yet.
