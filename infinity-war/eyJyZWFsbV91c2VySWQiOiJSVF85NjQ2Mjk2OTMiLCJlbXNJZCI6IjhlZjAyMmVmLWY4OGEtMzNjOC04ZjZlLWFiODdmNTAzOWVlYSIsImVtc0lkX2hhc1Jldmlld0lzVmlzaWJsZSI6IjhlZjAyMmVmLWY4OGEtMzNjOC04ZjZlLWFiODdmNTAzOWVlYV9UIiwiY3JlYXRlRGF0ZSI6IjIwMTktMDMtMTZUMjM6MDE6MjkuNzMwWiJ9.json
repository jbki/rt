Movie has good action scenes and the team up with the Guardians and the Avengers was epic! Thanos is definitely the biggest and baddest villain of the MCU, and his motivations are believable. Although all the heroes were hard to keep up with, the movies plot moved forward and got straight to the point without wasting too much time.
