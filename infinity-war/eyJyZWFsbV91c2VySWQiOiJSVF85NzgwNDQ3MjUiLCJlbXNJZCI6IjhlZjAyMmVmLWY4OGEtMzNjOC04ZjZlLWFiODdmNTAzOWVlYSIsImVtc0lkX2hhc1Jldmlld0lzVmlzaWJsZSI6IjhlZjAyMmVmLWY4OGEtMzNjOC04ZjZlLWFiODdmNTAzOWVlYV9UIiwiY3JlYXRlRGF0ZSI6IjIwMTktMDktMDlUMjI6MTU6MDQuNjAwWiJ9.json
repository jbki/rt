I like most of the single hero marvel movies and they are better as long as they concentrate on their hero. You get an idea about their drivers and motivations. But lately the Marvel just throw in what they got forgetting that quantity doesn’t mean quality. Every single hero is replaceable here, even their special powers don’t matter anymore as all they do is brawling...and if someone dies? Who cares? Maybe if the writers let die enough of them the movie will get better. Waste of time. P.s. who needs dr. Strange and Spiderboy in any movie anyway?","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-09-07T08:06:41.437Z","updateDate":"2019-09-07T08:06:41.437Z","user":{"userId":"913618115","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/913618115"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Hands down the best Marvel movie out there. The departure from the classic bad guy just to be a bad guy act to an empathetic villain is what makes this movie so outstanding.

So many characters in a single movie, and it is still able to tell a coherent, engaging and impactful story. This movie needs the last 10 years of MCU to work. I do not ever see another movie of this magnitude being made in our generation. A movie that got everything right. The music is great, the acting of the entire cast is fanatstic, the views are breathtaking. This movie feels like a gift. A reward for all those that stuck around with the MCU for all these years.","displayName":"Gimnei M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-06T07:25:36.453Z","updateDate":"2019-09-06T07:25:36.453Z","user":{"userId":"978243071","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gimnei M","accountLink":"/user/id/978243071"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"It's amazing, I love it.","displayName":"Dutch Van D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-06T02:39:27.165Z","updateDate":"2019-09-06T02:39:36.246Z","user":{"userId":"978241719","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dutch Van D","accountLink":"/user/id/978241719"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"\nThis movie is really good because the plot shows you a lot of good things, they start in a perfect world like we know it but after this everything change, with a war and a villain who wants to ending with half of the world to save the humanity... and when everybody thinks that it's a bad idea he just wants to save our planet in a different way and that is not a good to nobody. Then the heroes try to fix all and save the people who could die in the war, the heroes join forces then start the team work but this is more than war; they can show us the world in a different way to see everything, like how the humans are ending with all of our nature, with all what we want and we believe in a past that it will be forever, but that`s only the start of this, the heroes try to save what we know, I think that the message it`s really clear and we have to take care about the world, we have stop to think only in war, stop to think in bad choices, and start to make the change.\nFor the kids it is going to be really interesting and appropriate, in my opinion everybody has to see this movie to understand the good action, the soundtrack makes you feel in the story and you are going to feel a really hero after see this amazing movie. THE BEST MOVIE OF ENTIRE WORLD.  \n","displayName":"Tania  G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-05T17:44:24.910Z","updateDate":"2019-09-05T17:44:24.910Z","user":{"userId":"978240204","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tania  G","accountLink":"/user/id/978240204"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 05, 2019"}]}
