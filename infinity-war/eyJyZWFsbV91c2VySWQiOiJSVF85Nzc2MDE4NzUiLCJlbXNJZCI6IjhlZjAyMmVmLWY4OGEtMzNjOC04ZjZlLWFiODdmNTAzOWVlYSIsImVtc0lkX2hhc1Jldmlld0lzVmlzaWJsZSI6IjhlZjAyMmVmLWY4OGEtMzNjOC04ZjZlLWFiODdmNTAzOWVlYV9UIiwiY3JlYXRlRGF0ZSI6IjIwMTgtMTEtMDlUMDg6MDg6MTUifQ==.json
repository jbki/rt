I absolutely love this movie. You get chills throughout almost the entire movie, so suspenseful. In the end scene. The snap scene, the silence in the cinema's audience, the movie, it's all surprising and makes you want to cry. The villain won, the heroes lost, completely unexpected (unless you read the comics). If you have not watched this movie yet, I  recommend you to, even if you don't like superhero movies or if you're a fan of DC, this one is just something else.","displayName":"GREEN T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-11-04T23:54:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-17T09:27:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"976911423","realm":"RT","displayName":"GREEN T","accountLink":"/user/id/976911423"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was so good.
