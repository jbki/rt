Should I say \"Spoiler Alert\": The bleakness of the ending is unusual for the modern comic-based movie and it is a welcome change to the vast swath of campy superhero movies. Though it may spoil itself in its own way, Infinity War creates Thanos as a compelling supervillain that commands your attention throughout. Easily 5 stars.

With that being said I still dislike Infinity War not because of the storyline but because of the time they decided to stop the movie. I cannot accept that kind of ending this isn't suppose to be a tragic horror movie ending. Thankfully there was plenty of clues that this isn't the final conclusion thanks to Doctor Strange.  I'm disappointed there is more interest in surprising the public than there is keeping a traditional moral value towards the good always having the ending. I understand it is following the comics but it would be a good change that a majority would like.","displayName":"Giovanni R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T18:12:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-08T18:25:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"977262012","realm":"RT","displayName":"Giovanni R","accountLink":"/user/id/977262012"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"The Movie overall was quite good the bad parts are when they overall sad music to make things much sadder but I say it's not needed since the scene of SpiderMan dying is insanely sad and has no music but that ending was Ape Shit just awful","displayName":"Billy M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T18:09:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-08T18:12:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"977262010","realm":"RT","displayName":"Billy M","accountLink":"/user/id/977262010"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great movie from 10 years till now EVERYTHING pays off in this movie!","displayName":"Bam G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T18:08:14.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-08T18:10:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"965691164","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bam G","accountLink":"/user/id/965691164"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best cliffhanger ever....","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T18:04:30.524Z","updateDate":"2018-05-08T18:04:30.524Z","user":{"userId":"919838396","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/919838396"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Awesome!

This movie was, by far, the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was hideous from the beginning. It seems the directors do not care for performance in any way, shape or form, rather instead, how many 'wowee's' they can get from overblown CGI stunts, which by the way, were equally horrible and poorly executed.  This movie is just another in the long line of crappy overrated Marvel movies which undoubtedly will carry on because people cannot see how horribly written and acted these movies are. Stop now Marvel - you've done enough to tarnish modern day film making. Simply HORRIBLE. Why anyone would ever continue to support this line of God awful movies baffles me.","displayName":"Ferny H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T17:49:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-08T18:07:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"977262001","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ferny H","accountLink":"/user/id/977262001"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best movies I have ever seen. Villains can sometimes be a bit odd or weird in the comics but my god is Thanos an amazing villain in the marvel cinematic universe. He makes sense and never comes across as over the top or cheesy or odd. He is honestly the best thought out villain I think I have ever seen in a movie.","displayName":"Brock N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10155358000513788/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T17:32:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-08T17:34:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"976479664","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brock N","accountLink":"/user/id/976479664"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"BEST SUPER HERO MOVIE EVER THANOS WIN'S AND I SUPPORT HIM.","displayName":"Bobby B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T17:21:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-08T17:21:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"943929281","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bobby B","accountLink":"/user/id/943929281"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"}]}
