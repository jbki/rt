However, the fact that they kill the film's more diverse characters andeave us with a massive cliffhanger is definitely a negative aspect of the film.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/178031006350290/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T20:23:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T20:28:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249805","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977249805"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Just watch all 18 other movies before watching this one.

Yet, they will give credits to an average joe movie. Despite the fact that no matter how good you are, you will never be able to please everyone. If this isn't the future than I rather dumb down back to the basics. Hollywood has not offered us anything new lately but with MCU breaking new ground in filmmaking. I believe it will set a new tone for foreign CGI.","displayName":"leon v","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T20:19:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T20:34:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"537007144","realm":"RT","displayName":"leon v","accountLink":"/user/id/537007144"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Everything was great until the end. Another predictable ending where all is lost and in part two everybody comes back and they save the day. Need to get more creative.
