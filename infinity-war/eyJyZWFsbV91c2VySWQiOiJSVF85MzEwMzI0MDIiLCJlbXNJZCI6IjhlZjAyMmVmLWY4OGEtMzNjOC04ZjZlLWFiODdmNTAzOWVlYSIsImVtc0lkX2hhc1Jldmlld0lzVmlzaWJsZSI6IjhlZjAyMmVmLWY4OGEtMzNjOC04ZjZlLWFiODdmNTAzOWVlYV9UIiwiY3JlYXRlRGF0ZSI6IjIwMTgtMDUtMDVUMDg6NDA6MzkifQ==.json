They needed to happen though, and I LOVE how the Russo brothers bring everything together in a funny, dramatic, and endearing way that still, somehow, leaves us wanting more-even though we all know what they will probably bring us is more heartbreak. The vfx and cinematography are amazing and keep getting better and better in each movie. I love how they put the one post scene at the very end (though we almost didn't get one at all) because the people who do the behind-the-scenes work are why we even have these movies look the way they do. It's a great scene as well, so there's that payoff. Go see it and make plans to see it at least twice because there's just too much to take in just to see it once, especially if you're a fan of the comics.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10213412198992074/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T08:36:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T08:42:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"977257780","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977257780"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Avenger movie by far.

Good action and good humor peppered throughout as the movie develops and reveals the plot. I think what holds this back from perfect is, in my opinion, a contrived massive action/battle scene in Wakanda precipitated by an odd love connection. The battle scene is somewhat entertaining though afterall....it's more Superhero action!  The ending will disappoint many and in fact, it's sort of a double ending that being the scene after the credits is troubling. The ending prevents me from giving it a full five stars.","displayName":"Tony R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T07:04:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T07:37:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"975595581","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tony R","accountLink":"/user/id/975595581"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"}]}
