Many have recreated themselves or changed what it means to be a hero or a villain. Some villains were dull stumps of matter while others were masterful weaklings with controll. Some heros were super powered with little to intrigue till four or five movies in while others were low powered gems. It is this narrative that has brought the best and the worst out of the MCU.\n\nAlong  comes ten years of grinding through the best and the worst of cinematics and here comes something that brings the culmination of a ton weight of feathers the writers of this glorious universe have gently placed. \n\nInfinity War brings the rainbow down to the pot of gold. It dazzles you with every color in the spectrum before it blinds you with pure white. You are dumbfounded by the conclusion of emotions must neckbeards never knew they had. They give you the most beautiful rose to ever be stomped on and it is that very stomp that makes it so much more perfect.\n\nYour tears and regret fuel the heart of this movie. The stakes are higher then the ever have been and this is something you are not prepared for. So when it hits you like a ton of well placed feathers you are crushed. It is just an ant or hawks eye light of a masterpiece.","displayName":"Miguel V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001011641872/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T22:19:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T22:20:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"942306663","realm":"RT","displayName":"Miguel V","accountLink":"/user/id/942306663"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie, subverted my expectations in a satisfying way, managed to juggle a huge cast, but didn't make it a cluster f*ck.

Ever since the first Avenger hit the theaters, the makers have created a new uncharted territory for the superhero films. The comic elements, the casualness displayed by these superheroes got only sharper and crisp in the recent years viz. Thor Ragnarok is an excellent testimony to this style.\nIn Infinity War, it starts from the end of Thor Ragnarok and how easily the Mad TItan Thanos gets each of his infinity stones. Doctor Strange and Iron Man delivers a good partnership in their efforts to save the Universe. Bruce Banner as Hulk has given life to the vague characterization on paper with his own unique style. Funny and refreshing team of Guardians of Galaxy adds interesting angle to the twist and turns the film wants to explore.And in a film with 27 superheroes, others have small and significant parts to display their efforts and face the mighty Thanos.\nAs the end nears, Thanos becomes mighty strong with multiple stones inserted into his gauntlet and as Doctor Strange visualizes maybe the team Avengers have just one in 14 million alternatives to destroy Thanos. Film is well poised for its sequel to be released next year (May 2019); until then #ThanosDemandsYourSilence","displayName":"Vignesh I","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T22:10:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T22:25:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"977260059","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vignesh I","accountLink":"/user/id/977260059"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"For anyone who has been interested since Iron Man in 2008 then Infinity War is a massive pay off. Sure it assumes you've seen at least a number of the films in between but it would be hard for someone to see this with no background and not be confused. That said, Infinity War stands out largely due to how well created Thanos is as a character. Everything you've come to know and love about the Marvel MCU films is there, the witty humour and big action scenes and plenty of shocks if you manage to avoid spoilers. Definitely has a bigger impact without knowing the secrets but stands up to a second watch. It's a big film, and everything Marvel promised it will be. Downside, we have to wait 12 months for the next one!","displayName":"Ray H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001165660388/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T22:03:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T22:08:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"903961612","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ray H","accountLink":"/user/id/903961612"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"}]}
