You have to be familiar with all the numerous previous movies and SHIELD in order to know what these characters are and what happened. And this movie seems to have no climax, so when you walk out of the cinema, you sort of feel \"what? That's it? What's the point?\" The answer can only be got from the next movie (so it's really a \"movie series\" by its plot architecture...) .","displayName":"B J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-11T19:41:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-11T20:36:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"976289821","realm":"RT","displayName":"B J","accountLink":"/user/id/976289821"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Avengers: Infinity War is probably my favourite superhero movie, Marvel movie, and maybe my all-time favourite at the moment. It's dark, light, funny, intense, action-packed, and heart-warming all at once. There are so many brilliant moments, and I have no complaints apart from the very minor one of that Captain America doesn't have as much screen time as I'd have liked. 10/10!","displayName":"Floyd M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-11T19:32:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-11T19:35:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"977265142","realm":"RT","displayName":"Floyd M","accountLink":"/user/id/977265142"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was the best movie to me the only this that i am waiting for now is the 2nd one","displayName":"Josh G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-11T19:28:14.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-11T19:35:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"977265138","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josh G","accountLink":"/user/id/977265138"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best movies I've ever seen.
