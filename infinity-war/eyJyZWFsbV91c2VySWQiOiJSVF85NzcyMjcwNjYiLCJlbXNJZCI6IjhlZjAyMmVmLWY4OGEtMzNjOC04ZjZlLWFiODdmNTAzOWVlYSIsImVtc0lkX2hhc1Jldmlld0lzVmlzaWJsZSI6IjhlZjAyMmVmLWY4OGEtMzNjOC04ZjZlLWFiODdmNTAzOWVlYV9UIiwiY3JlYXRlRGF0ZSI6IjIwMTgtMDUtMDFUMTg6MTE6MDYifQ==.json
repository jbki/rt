The reason for this is that on his home planet Titan he long ago suggested that the solution to their overpopulation problems and lack of resources was to randomly kill every other person in his civilisation.\n\nUnderstandably, the people of Titan weren't entirely down with this plan. They ignored him, and later on the impending doom came and the planet was left a wasteland. From that day on, Thanos knew that the only thing to do was to kill half of every populated planet in existence.\n\nWhat the hell, Thanos?\n\n The idea that these people (or anyone) would thank him for using the stones to kill half of them is utter bull.\n\n#BadStoryline #OverpopulationFactor #AvengersInfintyWarSucks #Rushed","displayName":"Piyush S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100005126940621/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T17:59:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T17:59:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"960875837","realm":"RT","displayName":"Piyush S","accountLink":"/user/id/960875837"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"one of the best marvel movies out there, didnt feel as long as it was and left me wanting more.

The real problem is just how the first half paces this very contained structure of storytelling. There's no sense of building the film. It's more of just a sequence followed by a sequence followed by a sequence. Once the second half begins, or around the third act, the movie becomes a more focused building of story and events that culminates into a brutally epic finale and a shocking ending that closes the story but leaves room for the sequel/finale in 2019.","displayName":"Jay S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T17:53:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-17T18:51:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"976646506","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jay S","accountLink":"/user/id/976646506"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Well worth the wait.
