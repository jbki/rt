The pace doesn't slow for a second from start to finish and all the fan service that is required after a TEN YEAR period of killer Marvel Studios movies coming out is fulfilled...and then added to.

Marvel Studios promised a movie worth 10 years of building a cinematic universe. And, worth it, it sure as hell was. This IS Thanos’s movie. There are surprises no one is expecting. There are character interactions that will make people giddy. But, as much as the humor isn’t lost, darkness isn’t abandoned. Because when Thanos shows up, consequences there are. Trust me when I say no one is prepared for what they see. “Avengers: Infinity War” is indeed worth the hype. One of the best Marvel movies ever. And, Thanos is the best Marvel movie villain ever. Josh Brolin NAILED him. And, that’s why this movie succeeded. Well done, Disney, Marvel Studios and Kevin Feige. You did it. I give “Infinity War” a 5-Star rating. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Also, there is one surprise in this movie the anti-Disney trolls hopefully failed to spoil. And, that’s why I say to them when they try to spoil the movie: #NotTodayZurg.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-04-30T14:49:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T02:15:35.605Z","user":{"userId":"966126226","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/966126226"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The culmination of 10 years of Superheroes fighting Aliens, Machines, Demi-Gods, and even other superheroes.
