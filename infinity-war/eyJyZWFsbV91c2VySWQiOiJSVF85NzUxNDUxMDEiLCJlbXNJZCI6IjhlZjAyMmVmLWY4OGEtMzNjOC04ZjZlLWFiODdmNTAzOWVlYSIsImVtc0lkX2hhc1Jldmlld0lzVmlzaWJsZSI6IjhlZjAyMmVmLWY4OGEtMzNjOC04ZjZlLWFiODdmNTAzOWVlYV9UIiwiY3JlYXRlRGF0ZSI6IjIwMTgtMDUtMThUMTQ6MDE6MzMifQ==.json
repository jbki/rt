I also feel that the russo brothers are one of the few filmmakers who could have pulled it off and they were successful with what they were given. That being said, the movie had some very noticeable issues. I was surprised with the slow pace of the movie, the fact that it also a lengthy movie does not help. Some of the action sequences felt like a Micheal Bay movie, that could be due to the amount of characters. In the early parts of the movie, transitions felt nice but, transitions from one event to another was getting rougher as the movie was passing. The usual mcu problems like poor cinematography, score, and making jokes in the wrong time was present (they have improved on this issue but still present). For those who are not familiar with the literature of the past 10 years from iron Man, comprehension might be little tough, but even isolating the film from the MCU, it's a watch. Even with it's problems, the film is fun, action sequences are grandeur and exciting. It's visual effects are also remarkable.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/349998268743580/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-18T10:06:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-18T10:09:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"977002444","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977002444"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 18, 2018"}]}
