The different story lines throughout the film are (for the most part) neatly tied together. Thanos is a tremendous character, but his intent is sometimes confusing. The movie also fails at times to accurately portray how powerful Thanos is really supposed to be. \n\nOverall, this is a great film with a high level of re-watchability. 4.5/5 Stars","displayName":"Dirty J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-27T11:57:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-27T12:00:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"977337090","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dirty J","accountLink":"/user/id/977337090"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The directors did a wonderful job balancing the multiple amounts of superheroes in the movie, but it doesn;t have the same spark as the the first Avengers movie, which, contrary to popular belief, is better than Avengers: Infinity War. But still, this movie is a great movie, as it balances emotion and humour very well, and I definitely will watch this movie again . I encourage everyone to not only watch this movie, but to watch the movies that come before and after it.
