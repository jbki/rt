First killmonger and now Thanos! Both relatable villains who were trying to do good and simply had a different world view. I rarely consider a movie 5/5 but this movie was awesome start to finish. It was intelligent while having the appropriate amount of humor. It left a lasting impression on the Marvel universe with consequences carry massive weight on the characters. Considering the massive cast everyone seems appropriately placed and not thrown in just to satisfy fanboys. This movie will live in my memory for a long time!","displayName":"Julian B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/6309519/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T07:15:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T07:19:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"784526263","realm":"RT","displayName":"Julian B","accountLink":"/user/id/784526263"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The mark of a great film is that it makes audiences not notice the time passing by. I did not know how long the movie was, so I was surprised to see it ran for more than 2.5 hours. That's 2.5 hours quickly passing by. Another great mark of a great film is that at the end, audiences are usually silent. These two things happened when I watched Infinity War. Time quickly flew by, and the audiences remained sitting in the theatre, shocked and silent even after the post-credits scene finished. It was that heavy and powerful. Watching the ending and looking at Thanos, I was like \"That's how you make a villain in the likes of Nolan's Joker.\"","displayName":"Jao R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/649394249/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T07:15:09.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T07:41:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"803789442","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jao R","accountLink":"/user/id/803789442"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is hands down the best marvel movie ever!","displayName":"keramii p","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T07:13:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-04T13:26:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245532","realm":"RT","displayName":"keramii p","accountLink":"/user/id/977245532"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"An incredible work of art, juggling so many different characters and personalities effortlessly, whilst also giving a full character to barely seen before Thanos.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/198794870910170/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T07:12:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T07:13:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245527","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977245527"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE THERE IS","displayName":"Juwan B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T07:12:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T07:16:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245528","realm":"RT","displayName":"Juwan B","accountLink":"/user/id/977245528"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
