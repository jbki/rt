Nothing has been so ambitious, or on a scale this big. To see it all come together and pay off in the way that it did was unbelievable. It is going to take until the second half of the movie releases for me to get all of this straight in my brain. I guess I can't really say till the sequel, but when considered as a whole, this may very well be the greatest series of movies ever made. Individually there are certainly better movies. But no series of movies has told a story this big so well. Also, Thor is the best avenger. ?????????? 5 Stars.","displayName":"Bobby L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/575565893/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-13T19:37:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-13T19:37:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"810434043","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bobby L","accountLink":"/user/id/810434043"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Iron Man survived.

With a diverse cast of familiar heroes, there has to be an unstoppable and challenging villain. Thanos fits this role perfectly, living up to the established hype created by fans. The CGI is on point, the score is orchestrated beautifully, the plot is complex yet engaging, and the famously resilient Avengers are aged into their prime. Even if you have seen a few MCU films I highly recommend watching this. You will have a great time at the theatre.
