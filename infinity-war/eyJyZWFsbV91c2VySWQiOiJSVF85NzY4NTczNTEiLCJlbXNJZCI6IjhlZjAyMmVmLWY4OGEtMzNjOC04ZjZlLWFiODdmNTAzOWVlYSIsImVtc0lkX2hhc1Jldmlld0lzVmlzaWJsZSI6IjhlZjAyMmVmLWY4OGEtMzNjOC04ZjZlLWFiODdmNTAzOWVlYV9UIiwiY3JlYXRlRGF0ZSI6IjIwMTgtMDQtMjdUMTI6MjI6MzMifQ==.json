Close to the ending I was waiting for something to magically change like it always does... But nothing. Then spiderman's heartbreaking part and I almost shattered. The overall ending and close ending was extremely depressing. I was constantly worried about wether they could fix this. When the screen went black in the cinema and people gave that groan against the incompletion of story I couldn't stand for a while. I was  literally stuck. It didn't feel normal. All I want is for it to be okay again. Please Marvel come up with some thing like you always do. Overall it was worth watching. The ending makes you want to watch all Marvel movies again . To cherish last moments. It was beautiful.But because of you I'll probably have increased insomnia for the next two weeks . Lol great movie y'all it was like analysing art but fun??","displayName":"Lisa S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T12:21:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T12:22:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243202","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lisa S","accountLink":"/user/id/977243202"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The best Avengers movie to date.

Or both! This ends giving you a feeling of satisfaction. But at the same time, it puts you at the edge of your seat and in anticipation for part two.

It's basically a 2 Hour & 40 Minute sequence of 3rd acts. Theres great fan moments that will have audiences cheers right before shattering their heart. The movie is not a complete film as advertised. It is a set up for the next movie which did leave me a bit disappointed.","displayName":"joshua h","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T12:19:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T12:32:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"414523899","realm":"RT","displayName":"joshua h","accountLink":"/user/id/414523899"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"the less you know the better, just go and see this film now, take money out of your savings account, eat plain rice for dinner, sell your couch on eBay. do what you need to do to see this movie. it's capekino end of discussion.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10210870468060228/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T12:17:32.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T12:18:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243188","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977243188"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is the first movie of its kind honestly and man am I excited to see it again.
