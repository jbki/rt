I personally feel like the kids of Thanos didnt do much in the movie and they also didn't have any type of backstory as they were killed off stupidly. The whole time while I was watching the movie I was excited to see what was going to happen and learn more about all the characters. Overall it's a must see movie as I also watched it twice. I recommend watching it in 3D it makes everything feel more real!","displayName":"Julian C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-14T20:08:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-14T20:12:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"977319775","realm":"RT","displayName":"Julian C","accountLink":"/user/id/977319775"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"It's an ok movie but its all confusing.
