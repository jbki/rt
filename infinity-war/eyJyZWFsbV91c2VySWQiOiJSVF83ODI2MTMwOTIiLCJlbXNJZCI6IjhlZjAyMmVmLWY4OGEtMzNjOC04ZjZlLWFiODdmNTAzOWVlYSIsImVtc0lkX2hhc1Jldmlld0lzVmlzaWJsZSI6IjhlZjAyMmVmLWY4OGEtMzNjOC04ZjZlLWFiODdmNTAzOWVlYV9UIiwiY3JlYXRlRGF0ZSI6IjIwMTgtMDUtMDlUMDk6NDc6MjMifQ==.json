This was an amazing story.. it's nice to see how Marvel has really stepped up and listened to it's fans and made an amazing movie for there fans. To bad the folks over at Lucas film can't seem to or just plain don't care to listen to there fan's. With the success of this movie we can easily say it's NOT a Disney problem.. it's a Lucas film Kathleen Kennedy/Renial Johnson problem... Well at least we still have Marvel to help us threw these dark times..
