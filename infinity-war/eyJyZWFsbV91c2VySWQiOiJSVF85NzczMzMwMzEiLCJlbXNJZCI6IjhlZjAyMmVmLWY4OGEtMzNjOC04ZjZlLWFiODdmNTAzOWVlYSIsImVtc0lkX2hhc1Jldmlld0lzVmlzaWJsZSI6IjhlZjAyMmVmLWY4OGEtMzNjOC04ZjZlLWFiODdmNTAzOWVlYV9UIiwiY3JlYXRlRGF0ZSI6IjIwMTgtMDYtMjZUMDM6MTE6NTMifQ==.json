I know there is a great lead from this movie... there must be. This was very entertaining and way full of energy. Just not what I was expecting. Gotta put it to ya Marvel this one was certainly a surprise. I cannot wait to see what you have up your sleeve for the next Avenger Movie. Unexpected but Yes!!! Still 5 Stars... and sad (very emotional ending guy's).

Avengers infinity war has so many super hero's and still evenly splits screen time between them all. The movies main villain Thanos is probably one of my favourite movie villains of all time, he doesn't just want to kill half the life in the universe because he's a villain, he has a reason and a tragic past that fuels his ambition. When Thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe, the scene that fallows is sad and well acted. The fight scenes are legendary (especially the fight on titan).This movie is great and almost perfect.","displayName":"Jake A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-25T17:23:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-25T17:40:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"977335081","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jake A","accountLink":"/user/id/977335081"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"too much CGI. story was too confusing and difficult to follow without all of the history of competin characters. still entertaining though.
