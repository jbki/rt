This movie is a pure genius, handling so much heroes in the entire 2++ hours, the russo brothers did a remarkable job in making this movie. Thanos is on an entirely different level than any villain/antagonist/foe we have seen on the big screen. The best Marvel movie so far. I say the 10 years in the making and 18 movies before this, it was worth every money spent.","displayName":"Josef S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/620367856/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T03:37:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T03:45:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"878363949","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josef S","accountLink":"/user/id/878363949"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"#thanosdemandsmysilence :D","displayName":"Bhagyesh B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/545740146/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T03:35:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T03:38:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"867097294","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bhagyesh B","accountLink":"/user/id/867097294"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the greatest movie I've eve ever seen. The action is awesome. Sometimes there are too much CGI but apart of that is great. Thanos is a great villain, the best of all MCU.

It’s the moment fans have been waiting for. It’s the big one. It’s the big ride. It’s a dazzling movie. It could have been a mess, should have been a mess! There’s no reason this many characters at this scope should be handled so well but they are. It delivers on all levels action and laughs and emotion.

The evil Thanos wants to collect all six infinity stones in order to control the universe and kill half of all creatures as part of a cruel conservation plan. His formidable power is shown in the opening scene where he bests the Incredible Hulk and incapacitates Thor. The story has many major characters to juggle and successfully achieves a balance of integrating them all and developing a story. Once again Marvel brings their trademark special effects that are worth the price of admission by themselves, and action sequences with exciting twists and clever moves. Brace yourself for the heaviest of the Marvel movies yet. It's going to be a whole year before the next Avengers hits theaters.
