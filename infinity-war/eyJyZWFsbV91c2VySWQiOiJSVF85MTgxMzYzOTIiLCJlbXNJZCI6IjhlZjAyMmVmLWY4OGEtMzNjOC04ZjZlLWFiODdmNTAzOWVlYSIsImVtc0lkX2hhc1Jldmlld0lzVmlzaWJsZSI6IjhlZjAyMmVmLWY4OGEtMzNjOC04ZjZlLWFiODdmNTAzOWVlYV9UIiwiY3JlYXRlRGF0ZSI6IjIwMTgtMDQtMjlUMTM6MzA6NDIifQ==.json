Where it may not have been marvels best piece it was still a very captivating ride & up there with one of the best I have seen. it makes you feel every emotion & people are just complaining because it didn't go the way they had pictured in their heads. thanos is probably the best villian the mcu has seen, he makes you root for him but also hate him at the same death. yes there was many character deaths but ultimately that was always going to happen given the tone of the movie. people wanted to see this movie & are now complaining that it was too long, you just can't win apparently.\ncharacters will be back in the next movie we know that but those complaining that it's too depressing obviously were not listening when thanos said half of humanity would die. you honestly think this was gonna be all sunshine & rainbows. honestly I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it made me mad, made me cry basically I felt every emotion which I what this movie was intending to do.","displayName":"Denis F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T13:21:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T13:30:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"930433349","realm":"RT","displayName":"Denis F","accountLink":"/user/id/930433349"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was AMAZING!!!
