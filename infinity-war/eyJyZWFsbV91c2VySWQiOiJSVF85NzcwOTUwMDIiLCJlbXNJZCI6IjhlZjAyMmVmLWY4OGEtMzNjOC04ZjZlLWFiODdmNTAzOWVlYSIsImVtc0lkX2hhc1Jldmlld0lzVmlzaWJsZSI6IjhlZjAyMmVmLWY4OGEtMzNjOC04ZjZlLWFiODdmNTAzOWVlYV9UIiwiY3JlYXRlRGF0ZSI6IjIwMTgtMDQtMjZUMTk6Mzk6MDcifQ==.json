Now the long awaited follow up is another year! Russo Brothers did it just right but can't wait for the Blu Ray for all the extras! Much detail to check out again to watch a second time before Deadpool 2 hopefully. Don't share any spoilers until enough time passes. Too many actors to give kudos to with some special surprise team ups and appearances! What a way to celebrate 10 years of the MCU and glad to see this now before people talk about it!

They replace his compelling comic STORY LINE with an non-COMPELLING history. \n\nLacks Compelling heroes\n- All the heroes do for this entire move is shoot things and throw things. Only Tony Stark is ever GIVEN a valid reason for wanting to survive Thanos' proposed ANNIHILATION. The other JUST seem to be there. This is not to mention that there seems to be a lack of impact from Civil war, and no hero seems to hold any residual grudges. They also never formally resolve their differences in regard to the civil war.\n\nPoor Humor\n- In the THEATER I attended, most of the intended humor went unnoticed, with only a few being big hitters.\n\nNo Narrative Plot\n- The narrative is incomplete, with the only conceivable climax taking place at the end of the film, meaning that there is no resolution. The secondary narrative of Bruce banner takes place over a 15 minute period, and also lacks any sort of resolution.\n\nThe CGI is good (except Thor's lightning is not so stellar) and the action sequences are stellar, but I didn't watch the movie for these.","displayName":"Evan A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/860584737425550/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T19:33:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T19:44:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"976426458","realm":"RT","displayName":"Evan A","accountLink":"/user/id/976426458"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Excellent movie there were some problems with the end but i expect something satisfying enough in the next one","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1941526669252241/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T19:32:32.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T19:34:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"977240760","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977240760"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Spectacular, Immersive & Incomplete: Movie starts off on a darker note than most Avenger movies but also immediately gets funnier.
