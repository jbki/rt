Tony Start is witty and great as ever. Doctor Strange is refreshing to have featured so heavily. Thanos is a top notch villain. Not to mention the action, which is bar none some of the best super hero action sequences you’ll see in film period. Where this movie runs into problems is in its pacing and shallow dives into its characters (which was to be expected). The best way to describe the pace of the movie is that it has one speed, all out sprint. And for the most part it works, every sequence is fairly satisfying and fits nicely into the film. The only place where it shows problems with this pace is near the end, where the audience feels like there are too many things yet unexplored not to mention the ending which runs up on you and Bam! it’s over. It was one of the few movie going experiences where the film ended seemingly so quickly (the run time is long, I’m referring to pace) that everyone was left stunned and somewhat angry. The other area of concern was the shallowness of the movie. The viewer just doesn’t get as much time with each character as they would like. This is also tied to pacing, and granted this film was going to be impossible to get perfect with so many characters, but the decisions that were made to include two lines for some characters and give others a much larger role feels like it was only half followed. As a viewer I felt at peace with the decisions they made to give some characters large roles and other not, but then they didn’t fully follow that. It still forced the larger roles to be shallowed out and it felt me unsatisfied. At the end of the day it is still an impressive accomplishment to juggle this roster of cast members and the verdict is, it mostly worked. Infinity war feels like a movie that won’t truly receive its judgement until its sequel comes out next year. Like the Forbes review stated, it feels incomplete and I would have to agree. That being said I think the Russo brothers were going for that, as hard as it is for us, the viewers, to swallow.
