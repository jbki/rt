What a film this is!! The Russo Brothers had delivered once again... The cast is best than ever prior to this, especially Josh Brolin as Thanos, this man brings his A game in this film and his performance is easily the best by a mile. People are going to complain that this isn't a Avenegrs movie its a Thanos movie, and I agree because it set out to be that he is the main Character, but I don't have any problems with that, and besides the Avengers are split up into 2 groups, space and earth which brings the storytelling to another level as its shows the effects of the Avengers not being together to stop the incoming threat of one Thanos. Thor has the best story arc in this film as he is suffering from the (SPOILER) death of Loki at the beginning and the fact that he is out for revenge so he needs a \"Thanos killing\" weapon..... Stormbreaker. Plus his entrance into Wakanda... is a YES moment, will also gives you chills. The banter between Tony and Dr. Strange is great to see throughout the film. And it ends on the greatest Cliffhanger in film history since Empire Strikes Back........ this had everything, action, humour, suspense, and ending on a chilling note....","displayName":"Martyn K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-22T19:36:08.544Z","updateDate":"2019-10-22T19:36:08.544Z","user":{"userId":"968357867","realm":"RT","displayName":"Martyn K","accountLink":"/user/id/968357867"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Far far better movie than endgame.
