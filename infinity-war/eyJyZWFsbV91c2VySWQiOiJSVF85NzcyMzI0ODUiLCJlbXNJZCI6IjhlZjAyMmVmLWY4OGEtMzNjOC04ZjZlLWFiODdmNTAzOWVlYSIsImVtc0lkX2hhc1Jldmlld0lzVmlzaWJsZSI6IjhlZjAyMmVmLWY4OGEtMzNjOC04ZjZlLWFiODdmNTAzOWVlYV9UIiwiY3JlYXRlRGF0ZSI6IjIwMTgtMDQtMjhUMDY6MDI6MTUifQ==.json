I can without a doubt say that it will keep you at the edge of your seat the entire time. It is unlike the other “Marvel Studios” movies. Very dark and targeted towards an older audience. It is more of a “heist” film rather than a “war” but that was expected saying as it’s all been leading to him collecting the stones. Don’t get me wrong though, there definitely was a war. The start of the movie was very intense and really sets the tone of the movie as a whole. Thanos was a really great villian and in my opinion, the best villian of the MCU. I did have a bit of a complaint on the The Black Order(the cull obsidian) as they did not touch on them much and they felt more like more like slot fillers yet, I still believe they did a great job using them with the time period they had. The only other complaint I have with the film is just a bit of pacing problems here and there. You really have to pay attention to understand what is happening also (WATCH THE OTHER MARVEL STUDIO FILMS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT LED UP TO THIS AMAZING FILM). Paying attention shouldn’t be a problem though because the movie will keep you at the edge of your seat the entire time as I stated earlier. Over all, I believe the Russo Brothers did a really wonderful job directing the movie and it will leave you wanting more when you finish it. I’ve never seen more people stay after the movie finished. It was really well done and very exciting and sad. It was so much things to process and it leaves you really wanting more! Thanos is a solid villian and I’m definitely coming back for the untitled Avengers 4!!!
