It should be said that in a film with a cast this big, certain people are going to shine more than others, but even people in supporting roles did a good job. It was long though and intense almost too much, but still as good as it could have been.\n\nIt was good to see Thor at his best, probably the best he's ever been on screen, his story his motivations,  all were well done. If you are a thor fan, you will like this film. The same could be same of Iron man, peter park er and vision. It was a shame that the hulk had so little screen time and that bruce banner was stuck using the hulk buster which he clearly was inexperienced in using, but that didn't detract that much from the film.\n\nGood to see Wakanda play a pivotal role in being at the forefront of the battle.","displayName":"Joshua-Daniel S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-12T12:17:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-13T11:32:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"920126270","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joshua-Daniel S","accountLink":"/user/id/920126270"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Very good movie was highy impressed","displayName":"Luke%20 E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-12T12:05:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-12T12:06:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"977265947","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luke%20 E","accountLink":"/user/id/977265947"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Nailed the Epic part of it.

The pacing is fantastic with non stop action that I was hoping to see. As well as the fact that Marvel decided to go beyond expectations and let the villain win spectacularly. This is Thanos' story and they make him believable and relatable as good as it gets along with how done to Earth he really is, and not just pure evil. Thank you to the directors for a film movie history will never forget.","displayName":"Tyler M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-12T11:23:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-12T11:28:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"977265904","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tyler M","accountLink":"/user/id/977265904"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"As a Marvel fan, I enjoyed the first part of Infinity War. I can see why non Marvel fans struggle to understand the multiple storylines and how each character figures into the whole. Good one liners, especially the name Thor has for Rocket.

Interesting villain, more back story would be awesome..","displayName":"Tara M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/697317724/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-12T11:00:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-12T11:04:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"864115605","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tara M","accountLink":"/user/id/864115605"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Exciting and enjoyable popcorn blockbuster with characters in which, collectively, we've been invested in for decades.

A big applause to the visual effect supervisors. But the end of the movie was really a whole lot of mess. The movie should have end when Thanos snipped with his finger, while Thor tried to stop him. Then it would have ended with a cliffhanger and the audicence was more interest in watching the sequel.","displayName":"Emilia G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-12T10:31:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-12T10:34:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"977261579","realm":"RT","displayName":"Emilia G","accountLink":"/user/id/977261579"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Truly the best of the MCU movies ever.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2332885513604867/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-12T09:07:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-12T09:08:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"977265756","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977265756"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 12, 2018"}]}
