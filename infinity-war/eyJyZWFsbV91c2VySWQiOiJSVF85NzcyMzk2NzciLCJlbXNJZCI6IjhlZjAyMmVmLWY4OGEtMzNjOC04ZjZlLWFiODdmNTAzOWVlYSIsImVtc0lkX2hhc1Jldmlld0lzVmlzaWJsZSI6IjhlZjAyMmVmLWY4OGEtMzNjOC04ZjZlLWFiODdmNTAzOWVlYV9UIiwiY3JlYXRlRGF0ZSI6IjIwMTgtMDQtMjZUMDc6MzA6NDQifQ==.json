Marvel fans will go mad for it and first timers will still feel emotional when leaving the cinema as this movie leaves you with questions and anticipation for its sequel. Incredible action scenes throughout the movie with comical dialogue from all characters involved who all get a fair amount of screen time needed to bring this film together and keep the plot rolling. Thanks as the big bad of marvel will leave you satisfied a villain that has a goal to make a better universe before it destroys itself, his quest for the infinity stones gives you fear for the heroes but also somehow manages to make you feel sympathetic at times for the big bad titan. Just an incredible film which satisfies its audience but also leaves you excited for the MCU's next big films.","displayName":"Jason D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T07:12:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T14:43:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"977239650","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jason D","accountLink":"/user/id/977239650"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Action, story, audio, visuals... this film did the impossible.

An excellently crafted story, portrayed flawlessly by the case of each story arc right up until the climactic cliff hanger and one of the best post credit scenes yet from Marvel. Miss this at your peril, should go down as the best Marvel, if not super hero film in history.","displayName":"Lex B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T06:54:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T07:37:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"977239629","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lex B","accountLink":"/user/id/977239629"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Although the length of the film is quite long you will soon forget that and be driven in the amazing story characters and humour. the relationships were well played out and i am EXTREMELY satisfied.amazing movie","displayName":"Kwadwo a","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T06:43:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T06:45:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"977239608","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kwadwo a","accountLink":"/user/id/977239608"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"one of my favorites avengers movies","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T06:31:21.511Z","updateDate":"2018-07-24T18:56:03.530Z","user":{"userId":"941581827","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/941581827"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"this film has a storyline like a roller-coaster and has a natural humor","displayName":"zain m","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T06:29:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T14:52:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"977239582","realm":"RT","displayName":"zain m","accountLink":"/user/id/977239582"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"}]}
