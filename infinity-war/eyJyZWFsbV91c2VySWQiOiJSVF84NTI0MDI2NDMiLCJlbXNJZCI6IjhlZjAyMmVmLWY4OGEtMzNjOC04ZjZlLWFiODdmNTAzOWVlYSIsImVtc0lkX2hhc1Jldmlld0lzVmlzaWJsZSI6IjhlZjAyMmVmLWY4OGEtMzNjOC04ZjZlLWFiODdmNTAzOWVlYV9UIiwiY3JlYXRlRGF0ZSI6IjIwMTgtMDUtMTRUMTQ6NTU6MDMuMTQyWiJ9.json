Shameful. Should have read some comics as a kid.  I thought this HUGE movie was some kind of wonderful.  My only complaint is that it wasn't quite long enough.  It's ok if you make a 3 hour movie, which is about the length of time of a boat tour with Gilligan.","displayName":"Brian E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-14T09:29:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-14T09:33:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"964416380","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian E","accountLink":"/user/id/964416380"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I like this movie because it had 60 characters","displayName":"Max C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-14T08:58:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-18T21:36:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"948468453","realm":"RT","displayName":"Max C","accountLink":"/user/id/948468453"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It is a masterpiece but at the same time one of the hardest movies to ever watch a doesn't help that my wife of 13 years left me a week before this came out so I was devastated twice in 1 month","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-14T08:43:03.830Z","updateDate":"2018-05-14T08:43:03.830Z","user":{"userId":"969942275","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/969942275"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie punches you right in the feels","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-14T08:22:00.325Z","updateDate":"2018-05-14T08:22:00.325Z","user":{"userId":"942417004","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/942417004"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"As somebody who loves the mcu enjoys comic and understood how significant was. The only reason why it lost half a star was because it didnâ€™t take advantage of how Hawkeye and ant man both had a family to lose, a little girl. I get that when certain people died it was a shock to most people and it was done really well but they could have instead of just showing people fighting in the battle show more people around the world including Hawkeye with his kid as he promise to not let anything happen to them and ant man loosing his ex wife or kid or both something that will push them into a very pissed off situation. Everything else was awesome super funny","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-14T08:07:00.692Z","updateDate":"2018-05-14T08:07:00.692Z","user":{"userId":"965509191","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/965509191"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"We've all loved Marvel. Despite the concerns of elitists who think cinema is all about auteur projects set in former Eastern bloc countries starring actors you've never heard of, the superhero genre has made cinema something to be cherished again and put bums on seats right across the board, not just in these movies. But, watching this I'm beginning to think that, stand alone projects aside (Deadpool 2 I can't wait to see), it's time we had an end in sight., not least before the older actors start to become infirm. It's a spectacle, for sure, albeit a slightly disappointing one. The script is a bit silly at times and the action is too diluted, both in duration and because it is spread all over the fictional universe. The most exciting scenes in Wakanda got me all revved up only to fizxle out again. Thanos is a great villain played superbly by Josh Brolin and the ensemble cast put their usual shift in with the exception of a disappointing Mark Ruffalo who, frankly seems to have had enough. It doesn't help, of course that his alter ego barely makes an appearance. Of all tje movies in the series, itself the one that has the least stand alone status and asks more questions than it answers. My guess is it will all get there. It needs to before too long, that's for sure. Great fun and well executed but needs to end with a bang and on a high.","displayName":"Tim W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-14T07:53:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-14T08:07:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"976618354","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tim W","accountLink":"/user/id/976618354"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 14, 2018"}]}
