Would not recommend, if you thought you were going to have fun. THINK again... This had potential to be a great movie of 2018 and centuries to come. But it was missing two very vital characters to the story... and to think that this is a Marvel movie, without Korg or Meeks?! I think this is an absolute atrocity and a slap in the face to all Marvel fans.

My eyes were glued to the screen the entire time. I loved the villan. Thanos's back story is as rich and powerful as the Infinity stones themselves. Almost to the point where you sympathize with him. Unlike other Marvel movies, here there are loses, there are sacrifices, there is pain and anguish, but no avail. The ending of the movie was nothing short of a Shakespearean masterpiece, which I can garantee will bring out the crying little kid in you. This movie is a must watch. Do it as soon as possible, before someone spoils it for you and you miss out on one of the biggest emotional rides you ever get on. 5 Stars all the way!!!","displayName":"Juan R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001649382984/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T20:41:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T20:57:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"960636383","realm":"RT","displayName":"Juan R","accountLink":"/user/id/960636383"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Marvel movie yet.

With too many characters to count and a villain that has twisted motivations I don't know how the Russo Brothers could have done it another way. However, my gripe is the same as any 2 part film. It just feels incomplete. I'm fully aware that is the point, but I just hate the feeling of walking out of the theater feeling unsatisfied. The film simply cuts to black when a conclusion is still needed. Other than that the visuals, sound, acting, and writing all are on point. There are a few characters that didn't get the shine they deserved, but that comes with the territory of such a large film. Thanos is certainly terrifying and has justified that he is the one in the right. When hearing him out it is hard to find the major flaw in his plan, outside of all the death. He has seen his strategy work to his desired effect and it's hard to argue with the results. The surprise cameo that came was welcomed and put a smile on my face when this character showed up for the few minutes he did. All in all an enjoyable film with characters we all love. Just has the flaw of feeling unfinished and leaves the audience leaving in a bit of a funk.
