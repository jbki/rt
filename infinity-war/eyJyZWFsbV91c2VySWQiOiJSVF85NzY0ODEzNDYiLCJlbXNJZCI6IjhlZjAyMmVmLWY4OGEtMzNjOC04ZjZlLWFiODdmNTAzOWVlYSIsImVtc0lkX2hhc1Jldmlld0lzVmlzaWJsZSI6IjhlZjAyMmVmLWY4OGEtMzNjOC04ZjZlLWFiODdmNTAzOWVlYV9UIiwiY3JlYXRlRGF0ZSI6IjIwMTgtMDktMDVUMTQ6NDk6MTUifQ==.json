It manages to juggle the humongous cast by centering the movie around Thanos, yet still gives most of the characters their own arc. It does have some flaws, especially relating to the ending, but on the whole it is a stellar movie.\n\nFull review on my blog: https://vaderfan2187.wordpress.com/2018/05/07/avengers-infinity-war-spoiler-review/","displayName":"Vader F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-04T13:18:09.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-04T21:53:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"977457076","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vader F","accountLink":"/user/id/977457076"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Everything was leading to this. \"Avengers: Infinity War\" offers enough emotional weight and action to overcome its overwhelming cast and slow pace to deliver a film that will shock and entertain audiences for years to come.

If you had seen the other movies and were familiar with the whole \"Infinity Stones\" story line, it was enjoyable and easy to follow.  My problem was that I was TOO familiar with the Marvel characters to ignore the SJW changes Disney made.  *** WARNING SPOILERS *** Disney turned the Hulk from one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat.  Disney also changed the Hulk's alter ego, Bruce Banner, a world renowned genius, into a stupid comic relief sidekick the intelligence of whom is mocked by the Black Panther's little 12 yr old sister.  Spiderman is still \"Spider Boy\" ... Tony Stark's little \"golly gee, Mr. Stark\" comedy relief side kick.  A great plan to defeat Thanos before he arrives on Earth would have worked but for one meat-headed male character's blind machismo.  \"Captain America\" now wears all black, no shield, and goes simply by \"Captain\" so as to remove any and all reference to \"America\" from the movie (other than being the villianous gov't of white males that broke up the Avengers in the first place).  Of course, the ordinary female characters like Black Widow and the Wikandan female guards w/o powers are now somehow plowing through alien creatures with super speed and strength as if they were tissue paper.  btw ... we're supposed to believe that the \"enhanced intelligence\" of Captain America leads him to conclude that they'd fare better fighting off the alien horde with about 2k guys and gals carrying spears than the U.S. military ... o.k. ... and, of course, every powerful male character goes up in a puff of smoke to make way for Ms. Marvel to waltz in and save the day in the follow up movie.  THIS is why Disney is ruining everything with their SJWing ...","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10203709102283620/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-04T07:23:32.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-04T07:40:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"976648079","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976648079"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"its a LONG movie and frankly if you weren't following the Marvel Avengers series you'd get lost quickly as one character after anothe enters and gets killed off.

They did a phenomenal job juggling all the characters, it had plenty of humor while keeping a decently dark tone. All the fight scenes were amazing it had so may emotional moments and a few controversial ones too which are key to a good movie. Bu the absolute best part, has to be Thanos himself, we really are able to see the jolly purple giant for what he truly is. His reasons, his backstory, his love for Gamora, his pride, and his empathy for others. Rarely do I ever feel bad for bad guys, but i did for this one.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/310712929694553/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-03T17:22:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-03T18:28:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"977455777","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977455777"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"THE VILLAIN PLAN IS STUPID IF WE ACTUALLY USE LOGIC AND COMUN SENSE.
