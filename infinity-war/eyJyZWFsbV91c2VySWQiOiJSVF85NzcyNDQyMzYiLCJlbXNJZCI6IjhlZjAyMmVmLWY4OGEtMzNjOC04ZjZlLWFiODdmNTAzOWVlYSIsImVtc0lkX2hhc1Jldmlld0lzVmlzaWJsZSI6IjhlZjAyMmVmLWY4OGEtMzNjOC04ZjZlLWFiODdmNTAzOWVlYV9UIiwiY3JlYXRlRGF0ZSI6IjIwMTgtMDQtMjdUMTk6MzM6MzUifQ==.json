Not a great movie like \"Captain America:  The First Avenger\". but good.  The cast is, as usual, terrific.  All do very well in their respective roles as they have done in the past.  Despite the two hour and forty minute running time I was never bored which is a good thing.  However I do have some criticisms of the movie.  The script felt rather formulaic.  It could not be more obvious that everybody who \"died\" in this film will be resurrected in the next chapter in the Avengers series which will be released next year.  Also, the look on Thanos' face at the end of the movie just bleeds that tired old cliche that he finally won, but he wish he lost.  Still, I think this movie worked and I look forward to seeing next year's follow up.  See you then.","displayName":"Michael C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T19:29:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T19:46:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"901197331","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael C","accountLink":"/user/id/901197331"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This is the worst Marvel movie ever.","displayName":"Bri C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T19:28:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T19:29:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"931653961","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bri C","accountLink":"/user/id/931653961"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Not a dull moment in this Marvel masterpiece, and it'll make you feel too.

I do hope they go more into the backstory of a couple of characters, but I understand with so many characters and plot lines to stick to this makes it hard, but for characters like hulk who really hasn't got any stand alone movies coming up I believe they should go into his backstory some more. But overall great movie and I know I'm going to watch it in cinemas more than once","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/445142312587630/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T19:22:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T21:53:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"977244220","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977244220"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The Infinity War that decades of Marvel fans have dreamed of.
