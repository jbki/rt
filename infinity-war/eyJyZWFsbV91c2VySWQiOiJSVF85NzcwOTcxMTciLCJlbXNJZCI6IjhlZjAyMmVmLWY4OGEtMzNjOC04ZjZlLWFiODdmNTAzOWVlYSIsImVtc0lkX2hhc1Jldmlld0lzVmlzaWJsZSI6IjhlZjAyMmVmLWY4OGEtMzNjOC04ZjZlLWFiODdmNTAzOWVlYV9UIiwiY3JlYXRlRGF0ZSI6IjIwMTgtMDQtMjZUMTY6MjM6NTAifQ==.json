This is definitely a movie about Thanos, the Avengers just exist in his world. The movie’s 2 hour and 30 minute run time is hardly noticed, as the movie takes you from location to location, apocalyptic event to apocalyptic event, at breakneck speed. You will leave the theatre mouth agape, heart racing, and tears streaming. The guts of this movie can not be overstated, Thanos is the real deal, and you can not prepare for it. I will definitely watch Infinity War again, you can not take it all in properly with one viewing. Marvel has really outdone themselves with this gem of a movie!

The battles, the visual effects, all the fucking references to the comics are incredible, the jokes are completely balanced, what makes this movie a fresh and enjoyable one.
