Not complaining too that it was too star studded as it's a given and the culmination and divergence of all the Marvel Universe substories. Probably the only complaint we had, completely minor, is that the characters were wisecracks almost every minute of the film whenever there's a dialogue. Overall though, still worth the trip to the cinemas, which we seldom do nowadays.","displayName":"Marco Antonio L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/565184887/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T23:04:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T19:54:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"818314593","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marco Antonio L","accountLink":"/user/id/818314593"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"My name is Phillip and my dad is really rich so he got his hands on a video copy of infinity war.
