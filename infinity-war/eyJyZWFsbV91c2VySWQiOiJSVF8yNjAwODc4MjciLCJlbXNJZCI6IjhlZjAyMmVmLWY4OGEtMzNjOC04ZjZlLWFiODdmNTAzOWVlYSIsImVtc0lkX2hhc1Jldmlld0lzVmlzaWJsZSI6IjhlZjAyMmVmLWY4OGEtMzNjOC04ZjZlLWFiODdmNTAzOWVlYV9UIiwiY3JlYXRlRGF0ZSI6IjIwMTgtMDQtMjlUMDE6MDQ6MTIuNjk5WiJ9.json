It is superior to its predecessors on several fronts, boasting a powerfully developed villain and a plot with genuinely surprising twists and turns. Unfortunately, it still suffers from some fundamental flaws that shall be discussed later on.\n\nInfinity War's story is one that serves as a two-edged sword. On one hand, it is bolstered by the fact that--unlike previous Marvel outings--it is entirely unpredictable. It does a tremendous job at changing expectations as the plot progresses. However, there are several times throughout the movie where characters will make completely illogical decisions that completely violate their principles that they have claimed to stand for throughout the story up to that point, and there is no explanation for why this happens. The characters' stupidity thus is the only thing that causes Thanos to succeed at anything he plans to achieve. It's hard to talk about it without spoiling it, but there are so many unforgivably lazy choices made by the writers of Infinity War. The plot's originality is thus bogged down by these logical flaws.\n\nJosh Brolin's performance as Thanos is by far the best thing about Infinity War. He brings the character to life and gives us the most excellent, fully developed villain in a superhero film to date. His motives are clear, he's persuasive and decisive, and above all, he's scary. That being said, everyone else delivers performances that are by no means bad, but just do not stand out at all. The fact that so many characters are present really makes everyone involved come across as though they are just phoning it in, offering half-hearted delivery with half-baked emotion. The script is better than the acting, but once again isn't anything out of the ordinary. It's perfectly serviceable for a superhero film.\n\nI was more impressed with Infinity War's visuals than I have been with recent Marvel films. The action sequences in this new Avengers installment feel very original for the most part and set a new standard for the franchise.\n\nIn the end, Avengers: Infinity War is a good start to the long list of summer films ahead. It feels like the fresh blood that Marvel has been needing for the past few years. If you can get past the frustratingly inconsistent and lazily-written plot points and just enjoy Josh Brolin stealing the show as Thanos as well as the pleasantly unconventional ending, this will be a great viewing experience.\n\nStory: 5.5\nActing: 7.5\nScript: 6.5\nVisuals/Sound: 10\nEntertainment Value: 7\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 7.3/10","displayName":"Benjamin H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T01:00:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T01:00:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"898593371","realm":"RT","displayName":"Benjamin H","accountLink":"/user/id/898593371"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Many scenes which can make you go ballistics and it also have a cool storyline.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2064262313830137/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T00:59:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T01:01:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247684","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977247684"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"10/10 Without giving away spoilers, itâ€™s just a beautifully crafted film that is both light funny and sweet and then dark, full of depth, and heartbreaking.
