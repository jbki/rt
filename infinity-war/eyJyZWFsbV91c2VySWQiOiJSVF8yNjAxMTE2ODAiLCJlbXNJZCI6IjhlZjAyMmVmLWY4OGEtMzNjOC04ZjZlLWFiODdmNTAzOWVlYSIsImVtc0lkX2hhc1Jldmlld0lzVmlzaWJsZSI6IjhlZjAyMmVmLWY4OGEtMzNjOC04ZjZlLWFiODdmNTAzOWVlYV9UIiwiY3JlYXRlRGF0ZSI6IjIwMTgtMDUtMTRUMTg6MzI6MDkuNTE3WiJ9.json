Repetitive and twists are grouped up too closely. (Hint: Time Gem usage). It really takes away from the awe factor. Ending helped the rating to a 3.5, maybe a 4 star. I expected some more from the film, it felt like it didnt deliver a lot in theaters (hopefully when it comes out on 4k a lot of the holes will be filled). Death scenes could use more awe factor.","displayName":"Carlos E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/661712335/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-14T17:45:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-14T17:48:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"795318465","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carlos E","accountLink":"/user/id/795318465"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Thanos is your classic anti-Hero ...and the remaining ensemble gives an excellent performance.","displayName":"Mike S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-14T16:44:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-15T13:27:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"910853735","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike S","accountLink":"/user/id/910853735"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Movie was enjoyable, beautiful and effects were great!

A large part of the the Marvel manifesto is it's one liner humor between characters, as the dire action is moving forward. In Infinity Wars the writers have taken the hunore and the byplay to a new and frenetic level.. Yet, the jokes seem to  be a better propellant than the somewhat mundane and mediocre plot movement.  That movement seems to fool the viewer into thinking that the plot is moving forward, when in reality , there's a lot of fury without, forward motion. There seems to be an endless amount of lengthy, and at times unnecessary, physical conflict and violence, almost gratuitous at times.  That's because the producers decided more duplication in the form of continued redundant fighting is better to fill the time. After two hours of watching the continual giant fists, pounding people intot he dust it almost becomes tedious. That brings me to another point. The CGI makes this film a computerized cartoon with live action figures inside of it. The actors int he film must have had great motivational moments expressing them selves in front of a green screen. That any of the actors had even a modicum  of excitement in doing these roles is extraordinary.. In the final analysis, the film is like Lord of the Rings on steroids.  on a roller coaster. And like a roller coaster when you get off you might need to lay down for a while.","displayName":"Harry S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-14T15:37:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-14T15:57:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"906527863","realm":"RT","displayName":"Harry S","accountLink":"/user/id/906527863"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 14, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Hands down amazing!
