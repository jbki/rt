Avengers: Infinity Wars debut on the big screen this past weekend, in theaters all across the globe. Bringing in over $250 million domestically and 380 million internationally, making history at the box history. The film gets you right into the story as it begins where the post credit scenes of Thor: Ragnorak left off. Chaos, power, and destruction from Thanos as he boards the Asgardian ship. Movies goers are instantly given a sample of the true power of Thanos. The film is intricately put together with a well thought out story arc and dialogue characters. The Russo Brothers were able to shed light on Thanos' history, the infinity stones, new worlds, and bring them all together for the Battle for Wakanda. Avengers Infinity War is dark, action- packed, light- comedic tone, and the superhero team up that most could only dream only. \n\nStarring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Josh Brolin and Chris Pratt. Avengers Infinity War comes at what is the best movie of 2018 thus far.","displayName":"Lamont D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T09:40:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T09:41:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"977201432","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lamont D","accountLink":"/user/id/977201432"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing, truly breathtaking from start to finish","displayName":"Nick B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T09:39:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T09:48:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250868","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nick B","accountLink":"/user/id/977250868"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Very good.

Maybe a little violent for kids under 11.  Character's get the \"Phil Coulson\" treatment multiple times during the film.  It was incredible how the pieces string together and the action moves really pretty seamlessly from location to location across the galaxy so to speak.  Thanos is believable as a character.  Everything fans believed would happen going in, happens, sort of, in the sense that the Russo's flip expectations upside-down.  The realization hits you at the end when Cap sorta sums it up with his \"Oh...God...\" sentiment.  The people in the theater left without speaking.  Stunned silence, like a funeral, is the way I would describe it.\n\nThe original name of the movie, a few years ago, was IW: Part I.  We might never see a movie again in our lifetimes that is a direct sequel to 3-4-5 movies simultaneously.  Not just \"Age of Ultron\" and \"Civil War\", but \"Ragnarok\", and both \"Guardians\" movies.  Less-so, \"Spiderman\" and \"Dr. Strange\" in terms of the character arcs.  Usually, you get a three-act type of thing, like \"Lord of the Rings\" or the original \"Star Wars\".  This is 3-4-5 movies collapsing into one sequel which will, in turn, spiral out into 4-5-6 or more additional movies...not counting IW: Part II.\n\nYou have to really love the subject matter to do this good a job on something so incredibly complicated.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10216376637314388/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T09:36:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T09:54:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249720","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977249720"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome movie!
