After 10 years of character development, franchise building, snarky attitudes, and space adventures we made it to the big one (at least the first half). And this movie was...great! And definitely seemed to pay off! Never before has a studio taken its time and earned it's climactic (19th!!) feature. Infinity War juggles a crazy amount of characters so effortlessly. From its jaw-dropping and emotional opening scene, we are taken on a gut-wrenching journey as our favorite superheroes take on Thanos (Josh Brolin), a threat not only to The Avengers but to the entire universe as well. \n\tWith its grandiose score, the new Avengers installment is a non-stop thrill ride to the end, leaving only about two minutes of breathing room in the first act. The direction by the Russo Brothers shows that they know exactly how to make a Marvel film, and they stick in the sweet spot for the entirety of the film. The way they frame each shot helps to add depths to the scenes and establishes their mastery of the craft. \n\tThe actors of course shine throughout the film as usual, with the highlights really being Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Peter Parker (Tom Holland), of course Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), and Benedict Cumberbatch finds his strengths in Dr. Strange. Even though all the performances are pretty great, Josh Brolin's Thanos is what really progresses the film. Never before has Marvel been able to establish a villain with such power and looming threat, while almost being sympathetic. While of course Homecoming and Black Panther have done a tremendous job in establishing their villains, Infinity War is able to do this on a galactic level.\n\tUltimately, Infinity War has established itself not only as the best and most shocking MCU film to date, but has entered itself into the top tier of superhero films and into the upper echelon of all genres. Marvel Studios' and Kevin Feige's gamble has paid off in the form of an emotional, hilarious, badass film that, while still falling into some clich√©s with all the CGI henchman fodder, has cemented itself has a fantastic watch.\n\n9.5/10","displayName":"Seth S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-16T08:23:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T08:41:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"936384035","realm":"RT","displayName":"Seth S","accountLink":"/user/id/936384035"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"While everyone will want to see more of their favorite characters, the writers and director do a great job balancing and managing everyone without making it feel like a mess. The scene in which Starlord ruins everything is a very weak and stereotypical plot device, and the fact that they try to establish how smart T'Challa's high-school-age sister is by making her  one-up Bruce Banner is probably the most egregious  inconsistency yet int the MCU, but we have to make sure we have some sort of pandering empowerment regardless of the cost in every film now, right? In all, this is one of my top two favorite MCU films.","displayName":"Dysnomia *","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-16T08:21:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T08:28:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"975119392","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dysnomia *","accountLink":"/user/id/975119392"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 16, 2018"}]}
