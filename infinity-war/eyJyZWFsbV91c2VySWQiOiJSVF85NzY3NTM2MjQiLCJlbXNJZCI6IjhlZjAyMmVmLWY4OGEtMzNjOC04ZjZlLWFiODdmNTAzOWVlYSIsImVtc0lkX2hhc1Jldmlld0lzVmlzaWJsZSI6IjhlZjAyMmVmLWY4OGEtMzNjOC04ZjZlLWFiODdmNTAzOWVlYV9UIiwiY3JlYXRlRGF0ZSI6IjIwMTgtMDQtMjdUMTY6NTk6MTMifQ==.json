It was such a poorly written ending that I am not sure I want to see any future Marvals flicks.\n\nSeriously what was the purpose of that ending!! The only away to fix this is by messing with timelines!! who is interested in doing so.  Or worst sticking to this and what expect us to still watch future Dr. Strange movies!! Black Panther!!

The pacing is good, lessons have been learned since Ultron and the characters are segmented, which means they all get some arc (largely, rhere are exceptions). Hemsworth is wonderful as Thor, he's taken that energy from Ragnarok and carried straight on, he's funny, self deprecating and about all, badass. \n\nThis is a fun and exciting film that's a pleasure on the eye, and I would say does justice to it's comic book roots.\n\nThe bad - potentially is a little long, and the plot is very formulaic (not a bad thing imo, but could irritate some), the cast is still very big and screen time for some characters is very limited.","displayName":"David N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T16:48:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T16:54:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"976948265","realm":"RT","displayName":"David N","accountLink":"/user/id/976948265"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
