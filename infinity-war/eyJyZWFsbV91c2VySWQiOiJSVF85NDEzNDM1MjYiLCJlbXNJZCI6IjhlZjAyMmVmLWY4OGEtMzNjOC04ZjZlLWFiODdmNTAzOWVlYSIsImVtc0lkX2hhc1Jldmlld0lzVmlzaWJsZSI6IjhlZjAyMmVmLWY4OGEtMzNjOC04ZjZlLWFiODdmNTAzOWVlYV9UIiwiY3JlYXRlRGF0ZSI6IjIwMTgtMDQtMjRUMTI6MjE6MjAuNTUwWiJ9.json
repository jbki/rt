You know Spiderman, Black Panther, Guardians, and Dr. Strange have other film slated in the future. The movie loses all tension because you know they‚Äôll come back. Marvel decided not to call it Infinity War Part 1 because they wanted it to be a stand alone story. It isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a big long frantic never ending fight scene which leads to a cheap cliff hanger which ultimately is just setting the stage for Avengers 4, where you know this will be resolved. The movie simply moves too fast and it‚Äôs too long. There‚Äôs never a true break and any plot development. It‚Äôs constant knee jerk reaction to whatever Thanos and the Black Order are up to. Thor‚Äôs development is what saves the film but ultimately we don‚Äôt get to see enough of it. Dr. Strange is the pivotal character and his words need to be listened to carefully. Who knew that Peter Quill would become Jar Jar Binks? I know that I never expected it.
