All roads of Marvel's Cinematic Universe over the past decade have led to this, and the payoff is immense. Josh Brolin's Thanos is easily one of the most robust, sublime antagonists in film history, and his role in this film as the long-awaited true opponent for the iconic Avengers is executed perfectly. What's more is that it's beautifully shot with brilliant filmmaking that executes the thrilling action and intensely emotional drama without a hitch, excellently weaving together these countless different characters and storylines from over the years, concluding with one of the most daringly bold finales I've ever seen. \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is nothing short of one of the most downright legendary films of all time.","displayName":"Smithy S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-12T20:20:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-12T20:22:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"977331922","realm":"RT","displayName":"Smithy S","accountLink":"/user/id/977331922"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is something incredible, it takes a plotline which should be confusing and boring and turns it into a movie which shows deep emotion and amazing action and acting.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/668201761/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-12T14:36:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-12T14:39:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"977356586","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977356586"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What an amazing movie.

Never in the history of cinema has a single cinematic universe been brought together the that this movie does, and it is due to the magnificent ability of the Russo brothers that were able to balance the film in the way that they did that made it all possible.  This film is filled to the brim with familiar characters, but the Russos balanced them all beautifully, while giving them all purpose, meaning, and hearts.  Some of the aspects of the film were unclear - but that's what happens when you attempt this kind of feat.  It's the nature of the beast, and all things considered, I think the Russos did a magnificent job and making history with this film and setting the table for the most climactic events of the MCU to date.","displayName":"Jeremy B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002756465541/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-11T09:29:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-11T09:29:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"936231567","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeremy B","accountLink":"/user/id/936231567"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Bad!!!
