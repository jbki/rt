Of course there was a great expectation about it, and the film delivered more! And became memorable.\nAvengers:  Infinity War..... the story construction and the building drama delivered in so many great movies since Avengers 1 was so amazingly done  that the expectations for Infinity War was in the stratosphere!!!\nThen, this films hit the screens and literally OBLITERATED all these expectations, delivering an EPIC story, implemented beautifully by authors, director and actors.

I have waited 10 years for this, and still that wasn't enough time to prepare for the shocking masterpiece that is. The Russo brothers smashed it right out of the park, they literally kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. No film I've ever seen has been able to do that. It's such a different tale on a superhero movie, and very different to the rest of the MCU. The beloved marvel style humour is still there but not overloaded with it like Thor: Ragnarok, and the action was fantastic. Nothing bad to say about this film. I was blown away, and you will be too. Absolute smash!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2075040589380758/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T08:59:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T09:04:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"977242617","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977242617"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Avengers: Infinity War is the best Avengers movie we've seen, and also one of Marvel Studios' best","displayName":"Jackson B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T08:58:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T08:59:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"976548259","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jackson B","accountLink":"/user/id/976548259"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"No film from any other superhero franchise (DK aside ) comes close to what marvel has accomplished with this behemoth of a film. It is nothing short of epic!\nFirst half can be a little slow for those who are not a huge fan of MCU, however second half just pins you down and have you at the edge. Its brilliant in every way, from the thought process to execution. Its a perfect miss of emotions, entertainment and jokes, nothing like you have never seen before! Every character is brilliantly featured, nothing overdone, nothing overstuffed. It will have you dying for the next avenger movie, period.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1692572600862047/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T08:58:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T09:05:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"977242613","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977242613"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
