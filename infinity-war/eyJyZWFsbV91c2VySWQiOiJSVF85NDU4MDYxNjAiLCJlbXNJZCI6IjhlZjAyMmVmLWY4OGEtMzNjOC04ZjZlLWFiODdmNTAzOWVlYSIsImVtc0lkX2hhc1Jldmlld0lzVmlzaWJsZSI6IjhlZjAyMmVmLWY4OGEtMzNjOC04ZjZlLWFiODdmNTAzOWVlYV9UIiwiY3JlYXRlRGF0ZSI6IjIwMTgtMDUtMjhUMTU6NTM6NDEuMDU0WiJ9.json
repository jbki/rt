My... God. There is so much I want to say but I can't!!! This review is really difficult for me, for three reasons: 1) there has really never been a movie like this before, 2) it's a challenge to remain objective when I am such a raging Marvel superfan, and 3) it's everything I can do to prevent myself from talking about the spoilers... of which there are many, and which I am dying to talk about at length and in detail. I will give the disclaimer that my rating is more of a reflection of how much I enjoyed this movie rather than the actual \"quality\", per se. No one will ever say this is one of the greatest movies of all time... but damned if it isn't one of the best times I have had at the movies, and I am going to shamelessly gush about it. The Directors Russo did a superb job of merging at least 6 different storylines from a whopping 18 (EIGHTEEN!!!) prior films with a staggering number of characters into one cohesive film. It was an incredibly ambitious undertaking and they really pulled it off. They even brought back a few characters that were long forgotten, managed to add some new ones, AND found enough time to develop the villain, the formidable Thanos (who would have been a bit more formidable if they had done more than just slap a huge chin on Josh Brolin - his tiny face by comparison is just laughable). That's not even considering the drastic differences in tone, style, and setting that have been established for each of the franchises individually. It's a remarkable feat that this film (mostly) tempers and blends all of those differences as it weaves in and out of the different storylines, while creating a style/tone of its own. This is by far the darkest of all of the Marvel films - everything is not all sunshine and roses, and it doesn't leave you with a warm feeling in your belly that you'd expect from a superhero film. Thanos is by far the most daunting villain we've seen so far, and all our heroes combined have to run the gauntlet to present even the slightest challenge for him (I really worked hard to get that \"gauntlet\" pun in there). It gets shockingly grim. Paradoxically, it's also a total blast... it's weird for a movie to be both exhilarating and devastating at the same time. This movie is a Marvel fan's wet dream, but proceed with caution - it's for fans ONLY. The film assumes that you will know who everyone is and what makes them all tick, and does not waste any time with explaining things to the uninitiated. There is just no room, with all the cross-franchise introductions, gags, quips, and fights... so many fights! This movie is wall-to-wall action, and I will admit that by the end it gets a little overwhelming. It hits the ground running and doesn't stop, but still makes plenty of room for humor and a surprising amount of emotion. It's a lot, but not too much, as I had feared it would be. And it's NOT what I expected, but I loved it all the more for that. I am still reeling from the ending... and am already anxiously awaiting the next Avengers installment.","displayName":"Dana F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-28T14:43:15.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-31T09:47:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"901390149","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dana F","accountLink":"/user/id/901390149"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Kind of a cr*ppy ending.","displayName":"Corba D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-28T14:41:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-28T14:41:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"952464957","realm":"RT","displayName":"Corba D","accountLink":"/user/id/952464957"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie so far of the series!","displayName":"David B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-28T14:29:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-28T14:30:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"977152173","realm":"RT","displayName":"David B","accountLink":"/user/id/977152173"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"After weeks has been out,  I can finally say my 2 cents on Avengers movie. Here's the bottom line.\n\nOne thing that they succeeded for me personally, was not watching & reading any news in regards of Avengers movie. So I knew nothing of what's going to happen, thus led me to a thrill ride of the story. So two thumbs up for that Marvel!!\n\nI think to those who have been watching Marvel movie for years will have good time, give or take. For those who decided that this is first Marve movie you want to see in theater... Let me warn you, make sure bring a human Marvel dictionary so you won't be lost in the translation...??","displayName":"Dae J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1101723949/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-28T13:48:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-28T13:50:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"870834704","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dae J","accountLink":"/user/id/870834704"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"i felt every emotion in the book except disappointment","displayName":"bat m","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-28T13:48:14.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-28T13:49:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"977295471","realm":"RT","displayName":"bat m","accountLink":"/user/id/977295471"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Thanos is the most compelling villain I've seen in a Marvel movie and  makes this film the masterpeice it is.","displayName":"Liam P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-28T13:42:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-28T13:44:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"977295456","realm":"RT","displayName":"Liam P","accountLink":"/user/id/977295456"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it.

I was surprised how they balanced all the characters of the MCU (besides Ant-Man) so well. While I do they think the characters are going to return, the deaths were sad. The storyline that I found most interesting was the one following Doctor Strange, Iron Man, Spider-Man, and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Thanos is, in my opinion, the best Marvel villain (not including Loki) because he is a real threat and actually succeeds. I rate 8/10. You should see Avengers: Infinity War.","displayName":"Ryan A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-28T13:02:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-28T13:06:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"977293303","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan A","accountLink":"/user/id/977293303"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 28, 2018"}]}
