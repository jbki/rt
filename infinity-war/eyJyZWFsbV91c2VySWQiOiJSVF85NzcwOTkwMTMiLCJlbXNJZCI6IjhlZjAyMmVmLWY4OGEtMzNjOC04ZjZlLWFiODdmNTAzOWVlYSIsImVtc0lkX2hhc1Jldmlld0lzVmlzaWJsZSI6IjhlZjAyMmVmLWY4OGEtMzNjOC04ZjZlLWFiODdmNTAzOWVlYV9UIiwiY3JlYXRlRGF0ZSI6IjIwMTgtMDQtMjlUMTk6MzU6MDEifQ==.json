This action packed film also has romance, drama, humor and tragedy. The Russo Brothers did an awesome job directing it and I personally feel it is a worthy contender to win best screenplay and/or direction. Also Robert Downey Junior and Josh Brolin give you the treat of your life with their exemplary acting skills.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/614861585526733/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T19:31:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T19:37:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249724","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977249724"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"By far the worst movie I've ever seen. Unlike almost all other marvel movies, this one just seemed to be so completely scattered. The only interest, apparently, was to crowd as many marvel characters as humanly possible into the same movie to bring in the largest audience. I'm actually kind of blowed that 1/2 a star is the lowest rating I can do... if possible I'd leave a negative 2 star rating. But, so be it.","displayName":"Corey H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T19:30:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T19:50:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249710","realm":"RT","displayName":"Corey H","accountLink":"/user/id/977249710"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"awesome, wish it was twice as long","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T19:28:57.530Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T19:28:57.530Z","user":{"userId":"966001789","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/966001789"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I wasn't sure it was possible to honor the spirit of so many characters, but somehow they managed to exceed my expectations.  All characters had a great story arc and were handled with great writing that honored both the casual and hardcore comic fan.

They launch right in and don't spend time recapping what has happened in the other movies already.  The action is great, surprises many and lots of questions left at the end.
