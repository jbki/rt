Brolin gives one of the best performances of his career. The film does a great job making Thanos a fully developed character. He's a \"mad titan\" sure, but you can kind of see where he's coming from. His scenes with Gamora (Zoe Saldana) were a highlight, especially the pivotal one involving the Soul Stone. That tear he shed was the kind of thing that helps him stand out from other MCU villains. Phase Three has been killing it in that department (Vulture, Hela, Ego). As for our heroes, the best thing this movie did was put together some interesting combinations. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) continues to be great alongside Spider-Man (Tom Holland), but watching him with Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) was great. The same goes for the team on Titan, which was those three, Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Drax (Dave Bautista) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff). The real stars of this were Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Rocket (Bradley Cooper). It's such a wildly ridiculous combination that you can't help but love it. They were so good together. This really felt like a big movie for Thor. He shined in a way that he hadn't before. Between this and Ragnarok, he's on a roll. I also loved the arrival scene of Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Falcon (Anthony Mackie). I'm glad the film acknowledged but quickly glossed over the dumb Widow/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) romance. The closing fight scene is a strong one and Thor's arrival was a genuine awesome moment. The closing scene is nuts. I won't spoiler it, but the entire theater was eerily silent as the credits rolled. The scene with Peter and Tony near the end might be the saddest moment in MCU history. Lastly, I popped for the appearance of the Red Skull, even if Hugo Weaving didn't return for the role.\n\nWeaknesses: With such a large cast, some people were going to feel underutilized. In particular, I was disappointed in the lack of Captain America, Black Widow and Winter Soldier. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) was grossly underused. It felt like he was barely relevant. As for the Vision (Paul Bettany) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) romance, I've never been able to get into it. It's better than the forced Hulk/Widow one from Age of Ultron, but not by much. \n\nOverall: This was more ambitious than all the prior superhero movies. For the most part, this was very well done. They paired people together in great fashion, the action was great, and there plenty of memorable moments. Everything involving Thanos was nearly perfect. He felt like a massive threat at every turn, while also getting enough development to feel like a real character. This is an epic that is one of the best comic book movies ever. It's the best \"part one\" I've ever seen with one of the most heart-wrenching endings ever.","displayName":"Kevin P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T10:08:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-13T06:52:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"976511688","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kevin P","accountLink":"/user/id/976511688"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A very good entry in The Avengers series.
