If you're a comic book fan, you might know where this all thing is going, but the movie plays with the circumstances in a way, that the story is not that predictable and quite stimulating. And if you're not, well, you probably will get out of the theatre very surprised.\nPs: Thanos is a superb villain.","displayName":"John L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T14:56:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T15:19:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"977258195","realm":"RT","displayName":"John L","accountLink":"/user/id/977258195"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Entertaining if a bit overlong","displayName":"Jeffrey J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1631780546/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T14:42:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T14:43:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"849835869","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeffrey J","accountLink":"/user/id/849835869"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"We've waited long enough and were not let down!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/517322331977343/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T14:23:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T14:24:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"976942678","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976942678"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"}]}
