Not everyone will love it.   There are pacing issues, awkward humor bad cgi in parts and under represented characters. That said..... I personally loved this movie.  It's not for everyone.  Talking about it will spoil the plot, and in the beginning, i was starting to think it was bad, but then a character i never expected shows up...... it was completely unexpected, but i realised the scope puff this movie.   The world that it's touching parts of. There wasn't much character development,  because it was so encompassing.  The humor wad speeding things up because the story had to be everywhere but end up with one overall story.   It's almost a reverse movie where the villain is the sole character against an entire universe instead of the lone hero against a horde of villains.","displayName":"Gerard N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000603202746/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T00:50:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T01:00:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"954277357","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gerard N","accountLink":"/user/id/954277357"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's pretty amazing what they did here.

I truly think they did the absolute best they could with such a highly anticipated movie. Some complaints about not focusing enough on the individual characters, but in my opinion that would've just bloated an already long movie. Not to mention we've spent ten years getting to know the heroes already, so I say no need for drawn out character growth.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T00:46:16.398Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T19:52:19.404Z","user":{"userId":"976934141","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976934141"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"This whole film feels more like an over-long third act of a typical Marvel film, than an actual film in its own right. Although it's long, there simply doesn't seem to be enough time for the quiet moments, leaving certain character deaths without the emotional impact they should have.\nBasically, it's one very long ongoing action sequence, with the usual quips and one-liners one has come to expect from the MCU.\nIt becomes clear very early where all this is headed, and as a result of this nothing that happens in the rest of the film seems of very much importance. Even the dramatic ending doesn't have the weight it could have, since we know that it will be resolved in some fashion when the next part comes along.\nThat being said, Thanos had a lot more depth than I expected, and there is definitely fun to be had with the film, once one has adapted ones expectations. Just think of it of as a Supernatural season finale, and not so much as a giant epic, then you're all set.","displayName":"Dee L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T00:46:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T00:35:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"946088666","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dee L","accountLink":"/user/id/946088666"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing because it's not what I expected and it was directed beautifully.
