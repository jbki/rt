That fully realizes its gargantuan possibilities. Using the intriguing villian Thanos the film becomes the best MCU entry to date and one of the best superhero movies of all time. \nThis movie will blown your and shatter your heart and soul. The stakes are higher than ever thanks to Thanos' goals of wiping out half of all life in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales. In order to do this Thanos and his \"children\" know as the Children of Thanos( Ebony Maw, Proxima Midnight, Corvus Glaive, and Cull Obsidian) will need to gather all six infinity stones. In order for Infinity War to make sense you will need to have seen nearly all other 18 MCU films that all interlude. For 10 years Marvel has been building up for this film which makes it that much bigger.\nThe script is surprisingly touching and smarter than ever. Going to all the different locations across the universe, heroes battling Children of Thanos ,  the outrider army, and eventually intertwining them all to create on final epic gargantuan battle. That allows the film to end on a shocking, chilling note. \nThere are simply too many actors and characters to talk about each and every one of them but the ones who truly stand out are Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange, and Josh Brolin's Thanos. They all have simply brilliant lines that leaving  you up in the air with a glimpse of the future of the MCU. Lines like \"There was no other way\", or \" The hardest choices require the strongest wills\" and \" My only curse is you\" as well as Ebony Maw's opening dialouge as he stomps over asguardian corpses, leave you begging for more and goosebumps down your spine. \nBrolin as Thanos delivers one of the greatest villians in cinema history who has unmatched accomplishments. In every line Brolin shows you Thanos' human and empathetic side as well as is ruthless and psychotic side. The wait for Thanos was truly worth it as he says \" [destiny] it's here or should I say.... I am.\" Stunning.\nMy of my final notes is one the dedication and attention to detail put into this film and that is shown in the CGI. These astounding accomplishments resemble 2001: A Space Odyssey(1968). Thanos and the infinity gauntlet worn on his left hand look nothing less than absolutely perfect. Real, lifelike. Unfortunately Infinity War is wildly unlikely to get much love from the academy, that's ok because frankly it's to good for them. \nIt will be a long wait for Infinity War's follow up Avengers 4 but with the Russo Brother's at the helm again the wait should be worth it. But still it will be a long year.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-01T04:43:12.464Z","updateDate":"2018-09-01T04:44:03.895Z","user":{"userId":"974009947","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/974009947"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie, amazing action scenes and story....However ending is not clear and leaves questions.","displayName":"STEWIE 1","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-31T23:18:09.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-31T23:20:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"977381210","realm":"RT","displayName":"STEWIE 1","accountLink":"/user/id/977381210"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 31, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Good pacing, great CGI, and incredible action set pieces make Infinity War one of the best superhero movies of all time.","displayName":"Bryan W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-31T20:28:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-31T20:29:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"977450209","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bryan W","accountLink":"/user/id/977450209"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 31, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"saddest entry of the avengers trilogy","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-31T17:19:28.142Z","updateDate":"2018-08-31T17:19:28.142Z","user":{"userId":"260182802","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260182802"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 31, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"They did pretty good juggling so many characters and the plot, but I keep wondering how do people find this entertaining.","displayName":"Scott R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-31T16:27:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-31T16:28:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"710784925","realm":"RT","displayName":"Scott R","accountLink":"/user/id/710784925"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 31, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Keeps you wanting more.
