I cannot wait to see it again.  The first part of the movie was a bit normal and unexciting, but I do not blame the directors.  Developing that many characters and still having the movie good would seem impossible but the Russo brothers managed to pull it off.  It is incredible what they were able to do.  So back to what I was saying, while the first half could have been a little unexciting at times, the second half pulls it back around to make it possibly the greatest Marvel film yet.  It is just so spectacular that I cannot even fathom how incredible that it really is.  And the ending of the movie-I won't get into any spoilers-is just INSANE!!!  It is so amazing!!!  I would say that the best part of the movie overall would be Thanos, played by Josh Brolin.  While I agree with many critics of other movies in the fact that some MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) villains aren't very threatening (which makes the heroes seem invincible), Thanos is not this way.  In the opening scene, the first thought is, \"Oh crap.  Thanos is going to win.  Thanos is actually going to kill the Avengers and get all of the Infinity stones.  There is no way that they could even hope of defeating him.\"  I will not say if that came true or not to avoid spoilers, but man-o-man was Thanos a real time villain.  And it was nice because the writers actually made you question, \"What if Thanos is actually doing the right thing?\" in a way that was similar to Killmonger in Black Panther.  Killmonger used to be my favorite villain but now it is Thanos.  I can't wait to go see it a dozen more times.  It was such an AMAZING and SPECTACULAR movie.  Also, there is only one end credit scene, and believe me, it is worth the wait.","displayName":"Alex S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-03-16T14:17:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T06:54:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"977115980","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex S","accountLink":"/user/id/977115980"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie by nearly any measure.
