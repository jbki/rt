All those things I wanted to see, and a bunch I didn't know I wanted, are all right here.

It is filled with action-packed scenes and great visuals, also humors and funny one-liners are not absent in this one and audience will surely love every bit of it.

As the massive corssover movie it is, it doesnt have a lot of talking, since you already know everything from the last 18 movies, but instead focuses on the action, interactions of the characters, and the villain development.

It's a bit quick in some storylines and character's arc, but for so many characters put together it works. They really did it!
