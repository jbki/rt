Infinity War efficiently fit a lot of substance in a short amount of time. All the sub-franchises seamlessly crossed over into one epic flick. It was not a perfect movie, as I thought the story had some minor holes in different parts throughout. Marvel did make in my opinion much needed change from past films, that helped revamp the franchise, and take away from its predictability. Like all Marvel movies there was good humor (not as much as Guardians of the Galaxy), quality music, and great graphics and editing.","displayName":"Chris G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002287813363/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T19:27:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T23:56:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"936750087","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris G","accountLink":"/user/id/936750087"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"wow wow wow wow!! so much fun and what an amazing theater experience!!

There's a pause to catch everyone up, but after that it's back to full throttle. The story jumps between simultaneous events continuously keeping you engaged. There is no downtime in this film, yet it's not difficult to keep up with what's going on. Due to the pacing and the \"race against time\" feel it leaves you raw, making the dramatic moments hit you even harder. This movie will have you leaving the theater feeling like no other Marvel movie has before.","displayName":"Zachery B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T19:25:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T19:33:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"339248225","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zachery B","accountLink":"/user/id/339248225"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Brilliant. I've knocked 1/2 a star off because of a couple of tiny things that I felt were missed opportunities or out of character ( I won't say what as they may be spoilers) , otherwise this pretty much is the perfect superhero/ action film. It's brilliant to finally have a great villain. The new Star Wars films could learn from this. Having just watched it a 2nd time, I've amended my rating and given it the extra 1/2 star. This is definitely a 5 star film. Amazing!
