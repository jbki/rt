I have already watched it 3 times and from the moment the movie started till the end credits, it has been a nonstop fun, humorous, and exciting roller coaster with so many twists and turns. Thanos, by far, is the most intriguing villain in the entire Marvel Universe. He has a very interesting motive which I believe won't be explored until the next movie. But he definitely sets the tone as an all time baddie that you don't want to mess around with. You will have the opportunity to explore his back story and dive more into his background, especially with him and Gamora.\nIn regards to our favorite super heroes, Tony Stark and Dr. Strange were definitely a huge win for me as well as Spiderman. Their dynamics and relationship with one another was refreshing to see as in the past we got to see more of Tony and Steve Rogers. But this time around I did enjoy how they interacted with one another as there were no awkward pauses or conversations. Everything between with the characters was perfect.\nBack on Earth, we see how the Avengers assembled and unfortunately, we see little of Captain America, War Machine, and Falcon. But the battle of Wakanda was a sight to behold and even though not every character will have a lot of screen time, they all shine and exceptionally well I might add.\nThe only downside is that we have to wait a whole year to see what happens next to our fallen heroes as they embrace the adversity that is in front of them. I absolutely loved what Marvel is doing and focus heavily on good story telling, character development, and creating a riveting plot that draws the audience into this magnificent universe.","displayName":"Anonymous R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-21T17:18:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-21T17:53:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"977281654","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anonymous R","accountLink":"/user/id/977281654"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 21, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Completely unique movie that is only possible because of the 19 movies before it. At times it feels like one climax after another rather than its own story, but ultimately, it will do everything you want from a movie. It will make you laugh your ass off, cry your eyes out and maybe even think a little. Needs two viewings to fully appreciate, at least, because of how tightly it is packed with material. Marvel's formula is now being copied by everyone, usually to spectacular failure, while Marvel just keeps humming along as the best thing going in Hollywood right now, if not the ONLY thing going.","displayName":"Shawn N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1664126318/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-21T17:12:02.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-21T17:15:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"852913040","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shawn N","accountLink":"/user/id/852913040"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 21, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It was very long i think if it was more adventure and action i probably wouldnt watch the time.
