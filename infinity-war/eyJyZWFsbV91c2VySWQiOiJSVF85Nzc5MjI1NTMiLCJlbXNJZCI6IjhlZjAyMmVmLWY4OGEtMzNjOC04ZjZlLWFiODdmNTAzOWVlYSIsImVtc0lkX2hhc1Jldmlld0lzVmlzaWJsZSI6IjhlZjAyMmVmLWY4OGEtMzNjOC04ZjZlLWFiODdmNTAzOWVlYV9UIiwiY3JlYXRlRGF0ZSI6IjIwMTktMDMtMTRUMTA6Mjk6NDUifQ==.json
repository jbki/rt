So does it meet my expectations? Absolutely! Thanos is the ultimate villain. An emotional backstory along with a bizarre view of saving man kind makes him great. Thanos ( Josh Brolin) had the most screen time so it tells you how important he is in this movie. The Russo Brothers did an amazing job,balancing all the characters,smooth narration and of course, great visuals. It is definitely one of the best super hero movies. Overall, movie had didn't have any major flaws in my opinion. I enjoyed this movie to the fullest, meets the expectations.","displayName":"Aban A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-14T07:08:04.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-14T07:19:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"977299782","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aban A","accountLink":"/user/id/977299782"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Honestly the whole idea of some monster with infinite power without a way to be defeated is just boring.
