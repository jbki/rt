Most humor and story line is lost in too complex of a plot with too many characters who have no clue how they add to the story line.  Sad to see a decline in such a good movie premise.  If your expecting anything remotely as good as the first Avenger, you will be disappointed.  \n\nHowever, if you are hard core comic book geek, you might find this to be a good movie with all the useless details included in a grab bag of complex innuendo dependent on prior movies.   Movie is a long waste of time... with a HORRIBLY CONFUSING ending.   \n\nThor should have hit ME in the head... it would have felt better than wasting hours of my life watching The Avengers being degraded by a studio's over inflated ego.","displayName":"Joe M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-12T06:32:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-14T20:04:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"977265616","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joe M","accountLink":"/user/id/977265616"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"May 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"it's a really good movie","displayName":"Ben S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/578547485/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-12T05:50:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-12T05:51:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"808290539","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ben S","accountLink":"/user/id/808290539"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Terrible not happy with it and especially the ending ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-12T04:50:46.385Z","updateDate":"2018-05-12T04:51:25.122Z","user":{"userId":"260130766","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260130766"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":" Absolutely great movie üòçüòçüòç Amazing, fantastic and worth to watch it again and again This what superhero movie should be.

Avengers infinity war is the culmination of the entire marvel cinematic universe started May 2008 with the release Iron Man and it‚Äôs really is an unprecedented culmination of series of films interlinked together which important thing is making it all come together. Thanos shows us why he‚Äôs the biggest, the best, the badass that we‚Äôve ever had and the most frightening villain of the avengers have ever faced. The most exciting part is that incredible roster of well develop characters and it‚Äôs goes to creating a really combustible exciting massive scale adventure.
