The movie is nothing but contrived plot elements and heroes forced to be incredibly stupid or gimped so the villain can win can kill a bunch of people just for drama.

Makes a hero of the villain and pansies of the heroâ€™s. Non-stop action with little plot or character development. One wonders about the IQ of people who flock to these movies worldwide, driving up sales and the profits of the studios that make them. $300 million to make this monstrosity? It all went to special effects/CGI. One thing you can count on: Avengers: Resurrection in a year or two so the studio can continue stealing money from naive, low demanding fans who are satisfied with a video game experience at the movies. For anyone who actually believes a great movie should be a great story, you can skip this one.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T19:02:41.447Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T19:03:29.257Z","user":{"userId":"962257920","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/962257920"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"More enjoyable than the last several movies from Marvel.","displayName":"Matthew T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T18:57:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T18:57:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"976985224","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew T","accountLink":"/user/id/976985224"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"First big blockbuster movie to live up to the expectations in a long time.","displayName":"Enzo C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/891076120945456/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T18:56:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T18:58:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"971684457","realm":"RT","displayName":"Enzo C","accountLink":"/user/id/971684457"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"i have nothing to say. wow","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/437590976665003/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-07T18:51:05.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-16T23:51:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"977260996","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977260996"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2018"}]}
