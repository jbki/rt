I was pleasantly surprised that he wasn't some dumb brute like the majority of Marvel's villains, not only was he intimidating but he was an intelligent & complex character with motives that made sense. The teases of him in previous movies portrayed him as some silly cartoon character but who he was in this movie puts him in my all time greatest villains list up there with Palpatine & Vader though Palpatine is still my number #1 Favorite villain Vader at #2 & this version of Thanos at #3. Take some freaking notes Kylo Ren. P.S. Vision was so lame","displayName":"Lawrence L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T19:52:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T20:05:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"950513921","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lawrence L","accountLink":"/user/id/950513921"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"AIW isn't afraid to throw you right into the thick of the action from the very first minute and I must say it got me tensed and breathless till the very last scene. The movie can be very exhausting as the directors relentlessly pump you with action and plot twists just enough  to get you utterly exhausted but loozing for more. It's a culmination of 10 years of the MCU and the Russo brothers want you to know this. A truly visceral experience and arguably  the 3rd best MCU movie after \"the original avengers\" and \"black panther\".  Thanos is one of the most compelling and imposing vilians  you will ever see  in any movie I must say. One advice, wait till the very end to see a shocking post credit scene and avoid any spoilers. I give full scores on this one beacuase it doest disappoint.","displayName":"Ayodele A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T19:51:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T20:02:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"918901131","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ayodele A","accountLink":"/user/id/918901131"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Impactante y muy buen humor","displayName":"Kerlis S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/675825320/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T19:45:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T19:46:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"962324800","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kerlis S","accountLink":"/user/id/962324800"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"This movie is a mixed bag for me. The best part of this film is Josh Brolin's portrayal  of Thanos, and Thanos' backstory and reasoning. Thanos truly is a threatening presence. The first and second act are pretty good, and the comedy is on point and doesn't interrupt the flow of the movie. The third act of the film falls flat for me. (SPOILERS) The deaths are anticlimactic, uneventful, and in my opinion, made just for shock value. Having the characters fade away into dust is a little sudden and off-putting. The characters that die in the end deserved a more epic and honorable death. But I know why that didn't happen. The characters were killed for shock value, just so they can be brought back in the next installment. That's why they didn't waste time making the deaths eventfull. To sum it up, most of the movie is solid, but I wouldn't recommend seeing it more than twice.","displayName":"Maddox J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T19:22:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-19T20:09:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"976573182","realm":"RT","displayName":"Maddox J","accountLink":"/user/id/976573182"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved the movie so much.

Too much jumping around. Too convoluted. This turned out to be an obvious setup to a sequel, and thus had no real story of its own. Poor character development led to degradation of each of the character stories. There were a few bright moments but those were grossly overshadowed by the other 95% of the movie. I would not go to see this one again. Nor will I buy the DVD.","displayName":"Erik S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T19:18:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T19:24:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"977258480","realm":"RT","displayName":"Erik S","accountLink":"/user/id/977258480"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Black Panther was good, but had more flaws than Infinity war.
