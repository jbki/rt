I don't pay attention to the pre-movie stuff, so I had no idea what was going to happen. It didn't follow the generic superhero plot that everyother Marvel movie has. Also proved that Thor could do everything by himself and none of the other superheroes matter.

Adam Warlock was nowhere to be seen and he was supposed to be the main catalyst in the Infinity Gauntlet saga of comic books. I understand why they decided not to put him in infinity war, but if they maybe made a movie about him and maybe rope in Guardians of the Galaxy to have a feel for the character so that he is not some character from a movie then he would have made a bigger impact. This movie downplayed Thanos to just an ordinary villain rather than the ultimate enemy to all sentient races like for example; Thanos was a Deviant of supreme power with a vast amount of knowledge, possessor of the cosmic cube and is culmination of Marvel's magic characters. He also has an obsession with death and even the physical manifestation of death to the point of wiping out half the universe to gain her affections. Why did they reduce the Marvel Universe down so much that they made it a nonsensical mess. I really hope that they improve in the next movie or i will put all my support into the DCEU.","displayName":"Gabriel S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001846227526/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-06-07T07:27:35.256Z","updateDate":"2019-06-07T07:27:35.256Z","user":{"userId":"929159278","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gabriel S","accountLink":"/user/id/929159278"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 07, 2019"}]}
