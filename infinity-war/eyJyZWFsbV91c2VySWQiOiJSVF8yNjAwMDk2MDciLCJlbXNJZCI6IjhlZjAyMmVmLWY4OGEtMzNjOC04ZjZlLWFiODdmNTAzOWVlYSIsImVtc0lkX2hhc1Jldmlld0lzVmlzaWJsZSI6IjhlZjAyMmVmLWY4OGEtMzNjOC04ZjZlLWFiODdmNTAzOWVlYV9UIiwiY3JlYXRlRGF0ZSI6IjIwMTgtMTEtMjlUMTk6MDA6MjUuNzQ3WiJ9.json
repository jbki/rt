The original comic came out in 1991 so using that as a blueprint was difficult given the change in technology,morality and maturity of the movie going public.

This, I guess you could say \"climax\" to the MCU is an awesome one. The visual effects and soundtrack were the best I've ever seen in a superhero flick. The writing in incredible, although a lot of the comedy seems misplaced, especially with Thor. Other than the comedy, the film is just... amazing. Mind-blowing. 9.5/10, worth watching twice.","displayName":"Nolan G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-11-26T14:34:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-11-26T14:37:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"977632428","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nolan G","accountLink":"/user/id/977632428"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Biggest waste of time.
