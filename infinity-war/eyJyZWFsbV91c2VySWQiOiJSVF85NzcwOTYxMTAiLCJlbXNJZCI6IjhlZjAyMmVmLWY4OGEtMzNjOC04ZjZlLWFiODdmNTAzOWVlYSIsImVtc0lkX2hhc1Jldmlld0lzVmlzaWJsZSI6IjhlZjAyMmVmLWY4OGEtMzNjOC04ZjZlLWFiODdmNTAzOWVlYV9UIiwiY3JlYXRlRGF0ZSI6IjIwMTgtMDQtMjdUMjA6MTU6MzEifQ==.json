I am a lover of Marvel and super heroes and I know a good bit about the previous story arcs (in the MCU cinematic universe and from comics), and I KNOW that for people with little to no knowledge of this movie franchise it simply won't be grabbing. However, I think this movie is one of those few superhero movies that transcends what it means to be a superhero movie. Spoilers, obviously, but Thanos's objective is to relieve the universe of the pressure it faces by eliminating half of all life in it.  How can one help but compare that to todays world? Earth faces pressure from extreme overpopulation. Wether or not you sympathize with Thanos and wether or not you would, philosophically and hypothetically, make the same decision as him, the emotional resonance was strong for me because it had real world relevance. As a stand alone story, it is unquestionably weak, but when a superhero movie can make a viewer question the mortality of mankind as a whole, I call it successful. I will pay to see this movie twice!","displayName":"Eli H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T20:04:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T20:16:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"977244311","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eli H","accountLink":"/user/id/977244311"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Avengers: Infinity War gives you a lot to think about.
