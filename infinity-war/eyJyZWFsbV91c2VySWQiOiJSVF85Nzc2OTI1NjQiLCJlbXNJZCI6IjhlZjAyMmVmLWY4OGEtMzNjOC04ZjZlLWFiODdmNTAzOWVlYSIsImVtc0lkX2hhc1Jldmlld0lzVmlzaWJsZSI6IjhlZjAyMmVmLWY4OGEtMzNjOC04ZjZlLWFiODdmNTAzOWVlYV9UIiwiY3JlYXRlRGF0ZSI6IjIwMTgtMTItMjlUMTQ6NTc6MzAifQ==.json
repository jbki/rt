It was interesting and even when they failed, the viewer at least had the impression that they actually cared for making something different - not in this case.\n\nNow, it seems, the people behind this franchise care more for big explosions and advanced computer graphics than actually weaving a story. It focuses more on throwing familiar faces on the screen than actually telling any story about those characters, and even when they did start to tell some story, then immediately ignored it and instead pointed the viewer to the new shiny fight scene that started without reason or merit - very much like dangling keys in front of a small child instead of interacting with that child.\n\nFirst, the villain, that no one in the writing department cared to think too much about: his character is unknown, his motivations are just silly and unexplained strains of thought, and most of the time he is portrayed as completely vile or a creature in eternal conflict, without any balance between the two. I kept waiting for someone to tell me why? What was his thought process? How he made sense of those ideas? How does this utopia look like?\n\nSecond, the heroes, which there are too many of and because of how many there are, most of them don't speak, show little to no character, and have a moderate to low amount of action scenes. This becomes an issue to the point that most of them are forgettable and their inclusion becomes absolutely pointless.\n\nLastly, the story, that although was interesting by starting with the conflict, became way too convenient to the plot - characters placed in certain locations for the sole purpose of those characters needing to be there to further the plot, character behaving in a way that serves the plot more than the character, and a manufacturing of useless and pointless action scenes that go nowhere.\n\nOverall, the story felt like a tedious slog through scenes and characters, too much emphasis on over complicating the plot and moving characters around, and little to no character development - all for making the cliffhanger as massive as possible, which fails when the viewer doesn't care about the characters and situation.","displayName":"Shiver D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-29T04:38:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-29T04:38:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977692159","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shiver D","accountLink":"/user/id/977692159"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"they didnt manage togive equall importance to all characters.
