Good action but too little of the humor in earlier films. Long but still just a lead in to the next BLOCKBUSTER! I am less likely to go to a Marvel movie now than I was before these came out, the last couple of films are money grubbing but not as entertaining.","displayName":"Scott S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-02-11T15:40:14.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T14:33:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"967240669","realm":"RT","displayName":"Scott S","accountLink":"/user/id/967240669"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is a huge undertaking, a cinematic experience unlike any other, an experience unmatched in today's recycled ideas, an experiment of a colossal crossover, and Marvel Studios deserves kudos for delivering on this epic superhero monster of a movie. When the audience is as engaged with the characters and storyline, you know you've revolutionarized the cinematic landscape for decades to come. Infinity War boasts more heroes, more action, more thrills, more feels, than all superhero flicks of the past combined. The graceful balance of action, love story, witty banter, and dialogue, is not an easy feat to accomplish but this Avengers sequel does it with poise. The villain couldn't have been portrayed any better thanks to Josh Brolin, who is truly the standout performance, not discounting all the other terrific all star cast ensemble. Marvel is ambitious with this decade long endeavor, but it is sure to pay off in spades. Will some picky people and critics be disappointed, surely. However, give Marvel Studios props for having the balls to pull this saga off.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-02-11T02:58:13.725Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T03:04:59.887Z","user":{"userId":"976285004","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976285004"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best supermovie assembled movie after the first one.

I have loved almost all of the MCU movies and I was so excited for this one.\n\nIf we didn't already know about future movies that are already in the works, I might be more willing to believe the ending. But knowing what we do, we know they are going to do something to undo the ending. That is both a relief and yet also lessens the impact a bit.\n\nMy only other complaint is that I wish we didn't have to wait a whole year for part two. But that's just the nature of these things I guess.","displayName":"Jennifer N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/575240103637/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-02-09T12:03:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-27T18:49:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"782505502","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jennifer N","accountLink":"/user/id/782505502"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Marvel Studios knows what they are doing.
