The action scenes were amazing and the jokes were good (as with most Marvel movies) but my main nitpick with this movie is the ending. It makes little to no sense with the Thanos and Gamora part and they kill off everyone except the people who's contacts ran out. So hopefully they make a second one and that explains everything but yeah. It's a good movie and I recommend it to people but just try to ignore the weirdness of the unexplained ending.","displayName":"Merek J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-26T17:41:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-26T17:51:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"977291469","realm":"RT","displayName":"Merek J","accountLink":"/user/id/977291469"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"breast mcu movie yet!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-26T17:06:24.640Z","updateDate":"2018-05-26T17:06:24.640Z","user":{"userId":"260138548","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260138548"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I give 5 stars but left with mixed emotions","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-26T16:28:50.365Z","updateDate":"2018-05-26T16:28:50.365Z","user":{"userId":"969361833","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/969361833"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Movie was absolute trash and a waste of money.

There are really no weak points. Its a long movie but flows well and has lots of just great parts. Thanos was portrayed amazingly well.
