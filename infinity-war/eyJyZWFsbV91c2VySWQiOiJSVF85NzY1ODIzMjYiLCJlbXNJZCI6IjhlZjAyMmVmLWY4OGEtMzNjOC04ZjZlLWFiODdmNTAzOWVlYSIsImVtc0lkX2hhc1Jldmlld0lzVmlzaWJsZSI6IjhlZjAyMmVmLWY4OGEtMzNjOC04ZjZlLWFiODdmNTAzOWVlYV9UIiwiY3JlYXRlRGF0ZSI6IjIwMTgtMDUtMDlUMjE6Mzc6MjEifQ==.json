I find all of them pretty much indistinguishable from next, much like all the Harry Potters. However this one was pretty good. I liked the parts with Guardians cast and Thor. The whole movie just seemed to be a bit all over the place, but entertaining nonetheless. I could not get past the cheesy prop for the glove that held the crystals. Could they not come up with a rad looking glove and not a rainbow glove. Also Peter Dinklage's ridiculous accent and deep voice was comical. I dont get these movies so if you kill off half the cast, i guess they come back to live down the road.","displayName":"Johnathan D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-09T20:32:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-09T20:36:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"907167316","realm":"RT","displayName":"Johnathan D","accountLink":"/user/id/907167316"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"No real surprise, but I LOVED INFINITY WAR!
