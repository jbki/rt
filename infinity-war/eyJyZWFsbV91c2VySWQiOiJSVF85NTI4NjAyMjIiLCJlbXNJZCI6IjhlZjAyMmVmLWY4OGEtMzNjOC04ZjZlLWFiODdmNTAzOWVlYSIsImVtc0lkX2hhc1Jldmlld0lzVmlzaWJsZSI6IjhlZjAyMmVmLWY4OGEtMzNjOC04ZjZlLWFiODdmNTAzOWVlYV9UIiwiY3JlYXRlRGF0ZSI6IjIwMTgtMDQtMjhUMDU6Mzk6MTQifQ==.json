Everybody but Ant Man is in this epic. So what did they do?  They added four more MCU characters NOT in the credits. And did it masterfully. Until last night Black Panther was my favorite MCU movie Now it's Infinity War.  I have never seen a movie this epic executed with such precision. The decision to make Thor comic relief is brilliant.  Thanos is not only three dimensional, he (sorry humans) makes sense. Not even going to bother talking about the action. Let's get into all the twists. Holy Moses. I didn't see any of them coming. Some were in casting (Hi Peter Dinklege) to plot (see for yourself).  The film also managers to tie in nearly every previous MCU movie, making all 19 movies one big long 40 moviie. My prediction: it'll make it's money back.","displayName":"Matt H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T05:31:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T05:39:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"947203134","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt H","accountLink":"/user/id/947203134"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"A very good movie all the way up to the very cheap ending.....that ruined it.
