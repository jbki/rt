First off the action scenes are some of the best that can be viewed today. The CGI is spot on and the film is pumping with action throughout. it' easy to tell a spectacle of this magnitude that moves along promptly struggles to give each character the moments they need to resonate witht the audience. The russo brothers do their best to showcase the enormous talent on screen that becomes separated through plot and pervious mcu films. The comedy hits very strong throughout the film as we get to see these characters interact with each other and clash wtih their strong personalities. this films strength as a triumphant epic is also is downfall as moments that should cause remotion in us are ripped away by short scenes that don't have enough time to develop. Without spoiling the ending, it does leave the viewers in shock as the film truly revolves aroudn the villian (thanos) and his ambitions. What is truly disappointing is the lack of ramifications of the ending. This is si something marvel has struggled with for years, delivering the payoff and consequences for the main characters actions. although many will be shocked by the final act immediately. it soonly wears off and feels like cop out to the audience. given that this is the first part in a two part storyy i am eager to see if marvel will finally double down ans give their main characters the endings they deserve and if marvel will fianlly learn to take the risks to improve on their lack of surprise and uniqueness of films","displayName":"christopher l","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T21:30:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T21:47:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241046","realm":"RT","displayName":"christopher l","accountLink":"/user/id/977241046"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Such an amazing movie!

Sometimes with Marvel movies they start slow, but Infinity War starts with a punch to the face from your expectations and it doesn't stop there. I felt like I was watching an Avengers movie for the first time. It had that wow factor that the original Avengers had and it exceeded it tenfold. You are going to start watching this movie and begin formulating what happens next, in your head, only to  be like \"Well... That wasn't correct.\". This movie keeps you guessing every step of the way and it never becomes boring.\nPeople were scared thinking that the cast was too big, and they were going to jump around too much and make things confusing. But, that never happens. It's like they were working on solving an equation and finally they found the answer. The transitions are fluid and leave little room to get lost in the action. Every cast member seems to belong and when they are off doing their own thing it doesn't seem unnecessary. Thanos... He was everything he should and needed to be. The casting was brilliant, and he was a beautiful villian in this movie. That's all I'll say about him though. \nI cried, I laughed, I swore at the screen and gave moments of praise. Avengers: Infinity War figured out what to do in order to make this a successful film. They took a huge risk and ultimately, it was worth the 10 year wait. Drop all expectations you have for this film, go in with an empty head and get ready for the movie that is going to revamp your enthusiasm for superhero movies. I can't say anymore otherwise I'll start spoiling things left and right, but man... I can't wait to see it again.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/893373357500554/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T21:26:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T21:28:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241040","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977241040"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing from start to finish!","displayName":"Mark L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T21:24:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T21:24:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"933763764","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark L","accountLink":"/user/id/933763764"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I was concern that Disney was going to make it too kiddie similar to Age of Ultron but they didn't they got it right.
