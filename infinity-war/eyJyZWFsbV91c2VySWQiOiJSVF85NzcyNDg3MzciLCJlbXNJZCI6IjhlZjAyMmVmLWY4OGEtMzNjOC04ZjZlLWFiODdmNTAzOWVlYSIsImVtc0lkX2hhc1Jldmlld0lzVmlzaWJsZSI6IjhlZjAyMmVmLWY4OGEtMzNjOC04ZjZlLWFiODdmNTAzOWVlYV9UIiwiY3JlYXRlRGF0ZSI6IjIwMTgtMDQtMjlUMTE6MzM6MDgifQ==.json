See this in IMAX 2D. I've already seen in twice. Once in both formats. 3D is a waste of your money. Only do it if you really want to see it, and 2D whatever is sold out. Other than that, this is a must see movie. It's a real treat for those who have watched all of the MCU movies because it pays off what you've already seen. Also, the other movies is where all of the character development happened. Infinity War hits the ground running, and it ain't ending until Avengers 4 comes out. This movie deserves an award just for the amount of actors in it, and that it was able to tell a good and coherent story with all of them.","displayName":"Terrell H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/503653448/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T11:32:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T11:44:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"844796646","realm":"RT","displayName":"Terrell H","accountLink":"/user/id/844796646"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wow, absolutely amazing is all I can say without spoiling anything.
