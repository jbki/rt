Even though I like almost every character their death fell flat and unaffecting, expect two or three. Personally, I checked four times how much have remained of the runtime as I was bored out of my mind, and was very dissappointed after such a great predecessor as Taika Waititi's Thor: Ragnarok.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1742908132412209/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-13T08:22:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-13T08:37:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"977343636","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977343636"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Estaba renuente a verla por que pensaba que sería pura exageración con tantos super héroes juntos, pero la verdad es que tiene una historia sólida e hicieron un excelente trabajo uniendo poco a poco a cada miembro.
