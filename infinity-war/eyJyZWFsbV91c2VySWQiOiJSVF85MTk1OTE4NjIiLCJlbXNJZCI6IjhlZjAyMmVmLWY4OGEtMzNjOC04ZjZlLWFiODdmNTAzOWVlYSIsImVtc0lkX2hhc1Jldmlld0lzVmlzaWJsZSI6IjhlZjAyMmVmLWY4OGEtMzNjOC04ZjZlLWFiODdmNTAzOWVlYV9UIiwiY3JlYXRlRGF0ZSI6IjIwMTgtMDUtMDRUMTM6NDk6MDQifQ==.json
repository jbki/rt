It is definitely the best of the \"Avengers\" films, which I feel are a too stuffed with characters. I prefer the movies centered around one central hero. This one has an interesting plot, and some great action set pieces. Humorous moments.\n\nMy main quibble: I had some major issues with the ending, and rolled my eyes quite a bit. Can't say anymore about that.\n\nThere's also a lack of conflict, with all of these super heroes/villains constantly beating the shit out of each other, and the fact that anyone who is killed can come back at any time, or people can't even be hurt. It is much like watching a video game. \n\nWhen I look at other franchise films, I'm able to get emotionally involved when a character might *actually* die, such as in \"Star Wars,\" \"James Bond,\" or \"The Lord of the Rings,\" for example.","displayName":"Randy M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/690362050/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-04T13:12:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-04T13:12:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"790360282","realm":"RT","displayName":"Randy M","accountLink":"/user/id/790360282"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"That ending ðŸ˜­.
