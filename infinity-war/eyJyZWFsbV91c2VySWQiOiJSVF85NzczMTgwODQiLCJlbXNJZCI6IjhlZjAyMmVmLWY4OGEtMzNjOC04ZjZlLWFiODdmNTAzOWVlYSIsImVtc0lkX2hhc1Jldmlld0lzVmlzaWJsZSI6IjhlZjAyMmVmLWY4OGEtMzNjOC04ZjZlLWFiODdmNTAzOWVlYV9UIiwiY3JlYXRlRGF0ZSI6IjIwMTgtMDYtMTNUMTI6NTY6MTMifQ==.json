Though it is slightly oversaturated with characters and no one gets quite enough screen time it balances the multiple storylines of the characters well. This movie excellently plays off the emotions of the audience. Telling a clear story, punctuating the cohesive whole well as the audience waits for the end of the story.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-13T09:19:52.923Z","updateDate":"2018-06-13T09:19:52.923Z","user":{"userId":"970908432","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/970908432"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best marvel movies out there","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/261197794447419/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-13T07:52:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-13T07:53:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"977317780","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977317780"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love it. Everything in the movie, except for a visual effect shot with Bruce Banner in the Hulkbuster suit near Avengers: Infinity War's ending, is perfect.
