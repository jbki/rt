Everything flows so perfectly and the character's interactions with each other are on point. Thanos, as a villain, is the ideal movie villain. He isn't evil for the sake of evil, but you see for him. All he wants is \"balance\" and will do anything to achieve what he thinks that \"balance\" in the universe looks like. In my opinion, he soars past Loki as the best MCU villain, while only really having one movie to develop as a character. This movie's action sequences are some of the best in the entire MCU, and the action is almost non-stop. I feel that this movie ended perfectly, leaving a lot of questions and hype for Avengers 4. To conclude, Infinity War is an amazing piece of cinema that is in fact, \"The Most Ambitious Crossover Event of all Time\"","displayName":"Josh M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-19T15:10:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T08:21:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"977228171","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josh M","accountLink":"/user/id/977228171"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Depressing, but awesome","displayName":"Justme A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-19T13:09:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T16:48:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"977096033","realm":"RT","displayName":"Justme A","accountLink":"/user/id/977096033"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Arguably the best movie of the year, and one of the best superhero movies ever.

Aside from the amazing effects and fun one liners, the story was one for the ages.  The writers threw convention out the window and took a huge risk by telling a story of a compelling villain. The risk was worth it, this was not just another superhero movie.  This was a story of loss, frustration and bravery.","displayName":"Steve W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-19T07:31:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T10:36:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"976791100","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steve W","accountLink":"/user/id/976791100"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"AMAZING MOVIE OH MY GOODNESS","displayName":"Evie S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-19T07:21:00.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T07:12:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"977227715","realm":"RT","displayName":"Evie S","accountLink":"/user/id/977227715"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Thor was awesome!!!!!!!","displayName":"andrew d","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-19T05:21:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-08T03:54:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977227632","realm":"RT","displayName":"andrew d","accountLink":"/user/id/977227632"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Due to its rich and well-developed characters, stellar action, and much needed dark tone, Avengers: Infinity War is an absolute joy to watch for the whole family.","displayName":"Daniel B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-18T17:06:09.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-14T11:16:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"976261692","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel B","accountLink":"/user/id/976261692"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"really great movie,should watch 10/10\nsimple plot but I just really enjoying it","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10208374677803626/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-18T15:24:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T05:49:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"976906411","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976906411"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Let me get this point across first: Infinity War was amazing! I loved how it \"perfectly balanced\" humor with serious parts and with action scenes. This film definitely lived up to my expectations and was worth the wait. I only have two gripes against the latest from MARVEL. My first: Throughout the whole film, the Hulk was so annoying (I won't tell you why because then I'll have to check the \"hide review\" box). In addition to this, I felt the Movie could have been over so much faster if the characters had not done what they did at some point in the movie. That being said, Infinity War felt neither too long nor too short and this might be one of my favorites from MARVEL yet (second to Captain America: Civil War).
