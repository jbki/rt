You want it to be a smash so badly, the lights go down and within 10 minutes the hype is met and surpassed and continues to do so throughout the entire film. I don't recall a moment of the film I didn't enjoy. Congratulations Marvel for creating the first film to feel like a legitimate major crossover event.","displayName":"Michael O","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/824240704/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T05:11:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T05:15:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"821147745","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael O","accountLink":"/user/id/821147745"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"}]}
