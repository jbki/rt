For me, I've never enjoyed the films that have too many heroes running around. I normally leave the theater feeling stressed because all the character interactions were rushed or just too forced. However, Infinity War is able to rely on many varying films for it's already-solid groundwork, allowing the story to thrust the viewer forward from scene after scene without being confused. Amazingly, even with the dizzying amount of heroes in this flick, the writers and directors were able to have them coexist while not getting smushed. Most of the characters retained a piece of their story arc, and an independent voice; a marvelous feat to achieve indeed.\n\nThe jaw-dropping ending of this film was the beautiful, gutsy nail in the coffin. It added so much weight to the story, something I've never felt that much of after leaving a Marvel flick (normally there's a laugh or two).\n\nSuperbly written. Excellently directed. This is everything you expect a multi-hero blockbuster to be.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10208590139590888/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T21:36:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T22:03:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"977025248","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977025248"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I phenomenal performance by the one and only Peter Dinklage for making a big splash with such a small part.

That shit was insane. Feels bad for one of my favorite characters. That scene was sad. I didn't expect that much action in those 2 hours and 30 minutes and I enjoyed every second of it. It's just insane how it all went down. It's so cool seeing everything come to life and all the new suit and tech. The fight scenes were also alll incredibly well done and action packed.
