Thanos is neither the best nor the worst Marvel movie villain. The plot creaks in many moments, but it never crumbles.

Thanos is thrilling, terrifying, and at the same time, not really such a bad guy. The stakes are high, the deaths are heartbreaking, the action is fantastic, and the acting is incredible. I haven't been a big fan of Chris Hemsworth's Thor in the past (mostly because of how his character was written), but he really shines here. He steals almost every scene he's in. Same could be said for Thanos, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and a few other characters. And Tom Holland's acting right at the end there...wow! Incredible!","displayName":"Xavier Y","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-20T22:38:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-20T22:46:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"974903441","realm":"RT","displayName":"Xavier Y","accountLink":"/user/id/974903441"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It was \"okay.\" Great special effects, poor writing.

I hated it! Vicious, depressing and instigates violence. Wish I could get my money back. Of course there will be a follow-up to this crap. It made me feel like I was back to early days when I asked my military step-father about the reason for war. He answered me that there was not enough resources in the world to sustain so many people. He said ethnic cleansing was a necessary evil and the military had to do it. Hey...
