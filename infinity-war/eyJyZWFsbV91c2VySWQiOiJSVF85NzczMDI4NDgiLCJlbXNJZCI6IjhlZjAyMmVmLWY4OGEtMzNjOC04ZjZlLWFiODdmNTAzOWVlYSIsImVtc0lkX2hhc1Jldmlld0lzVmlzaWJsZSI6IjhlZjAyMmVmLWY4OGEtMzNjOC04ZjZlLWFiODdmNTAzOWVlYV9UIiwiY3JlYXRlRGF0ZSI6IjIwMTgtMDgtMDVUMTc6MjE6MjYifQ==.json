Other than Black Panther and warriors from Wakanda, but it shows more the often that The Avengers and the Marvel Universe lack diversity and is white privileged. It is yet again white people saving the Universe! Where did we hear that before! Also why does Marvel incorporated Thor, a greek god in their series and not for example the God Krishna from India? Towards the end there were so much of the same going on that you don't feel any empathy anymore of the entire Avengers crews when they died one by one, and you start to think the Universe might aswell be perished, who cares....cant stand the fact that this movies continue to go on and on, and wishing for it to end! The ending however is a cheap shot for a second installment.....","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/142759279901244/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-05T05:01:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-05T05:03:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"977231868","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977231868"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best Marvel movie. Funny, thrilling and emotional. The movie is more of a Thanos movie, his goal, his relationship with Gamora and his justification for wiping half of all life. The interaction between Tony and Strange is really fun to watch along with Peter. Thor and the guardians were the funniest part of the movie. The fight scene between Steve and Co. And Black order was fantastic. The Battle's on Titan and Wakanda were a treat to watch and Thor's entrance was just incredible and the Snap just leaves you speechless.","displayName":"Himanshu S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-05T01:12:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-19T20:24:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"977397495","realm":"RT","displayName":"Himanshu S","accountLink":"/user/id/977397495"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Continuing the cookie cutter format of marvel films...some humorous gags, some fun effects, but ultimately just an excuse the shoehorn all the characters together with a cheap and predictable shock endimg","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-05T00:41:59.772Z","updateDate":"2018-08-05T00:41:59.772Z","user":{"userId":"260119316","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260119316"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It just keeps getting better is the best thing I can say about this movie.
