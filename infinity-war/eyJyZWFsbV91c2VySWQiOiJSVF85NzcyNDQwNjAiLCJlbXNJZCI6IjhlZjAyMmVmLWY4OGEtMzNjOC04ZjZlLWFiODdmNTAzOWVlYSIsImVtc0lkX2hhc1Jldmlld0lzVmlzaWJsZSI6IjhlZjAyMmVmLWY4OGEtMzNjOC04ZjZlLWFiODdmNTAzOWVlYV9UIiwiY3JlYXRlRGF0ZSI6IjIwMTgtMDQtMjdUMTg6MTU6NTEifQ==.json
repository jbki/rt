The humorous parts are immediately offset by a swell of despair, and the main character is a villain who shows no redeeming moments, only a genocidal vision that is justified time and again by the message it's better to kill the ones you love than to allow others to suffer.  A joyless film that does nothing to support the universe or the fans Marvel has cultivated for ten years.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10216046418941248/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T18:15:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T18:16:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"977119936","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977119936"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Amazing movie !!
