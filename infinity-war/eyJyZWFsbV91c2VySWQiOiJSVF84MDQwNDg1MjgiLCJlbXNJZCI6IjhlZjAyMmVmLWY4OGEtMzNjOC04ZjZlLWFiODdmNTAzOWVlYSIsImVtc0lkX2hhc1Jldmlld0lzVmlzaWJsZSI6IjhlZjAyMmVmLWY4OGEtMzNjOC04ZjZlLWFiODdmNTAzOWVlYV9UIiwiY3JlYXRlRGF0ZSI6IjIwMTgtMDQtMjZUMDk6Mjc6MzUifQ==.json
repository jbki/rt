This is a movie 10 years in the making and it was definitely worth the wait. Dare to say that it is the best Marvel movie of all time.

They have addressed the concerns about previous Marvel movies by making Thanos shine as the stand out performing with his back story, development, and motive. Fitting such an ensemble of heroes into one movie was a gargantuan task but the Russos pulled it off. The tone was great, and the interactions between characters was fantastic and the heart beat of the good guy story.","displayName":"Gray F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T08:04:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T08:15:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"977239739","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gray F","accountLink":"/user/id/977239739"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing Movie , So intense, Great Comedy, Unpredictable and Certainly Shocking ! 10/10","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000464298277/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T07:57:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T08:01:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"977239722","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977239722"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Bloated, uneven, messy, long, and completely devoid of character.

Thanos is simply the best villain of all in Marvel Cinematic Universe. He's not only the evilest, but he's the smartest villain due to his political belief and quick wit. There were several comedic scenes that made me laugh my ass off, so I appreciate Marvel's idea with constant comedic in their movies. I also almost cried at the ending, so the ending was pretty emotional for all of Marvel fans. I would give the movie a rating of 6/5 if I could, so it was worth my money. Go and watch it, you won't regret it.","displayName":"Mitch S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T07:30:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T21:44:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"977239677","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mitch S","accountLink":"/user/id/977239677"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"}]}
