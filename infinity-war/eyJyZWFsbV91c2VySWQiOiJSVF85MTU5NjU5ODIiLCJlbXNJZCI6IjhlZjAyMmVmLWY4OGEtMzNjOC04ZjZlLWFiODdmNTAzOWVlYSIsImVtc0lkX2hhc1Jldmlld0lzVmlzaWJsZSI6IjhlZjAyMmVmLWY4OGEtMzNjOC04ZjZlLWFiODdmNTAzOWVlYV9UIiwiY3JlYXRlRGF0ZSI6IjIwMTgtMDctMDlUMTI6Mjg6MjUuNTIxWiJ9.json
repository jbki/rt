That is the question the screenwriters of Avengers: Infinity War must have been asking themselves when they sat down to pen what will ultimately come to be a five-plus hour finale to what the world has been witness to the construction of for a decade. There is so much happening and so much seemingly left to happen with Infinity War and whatever the as of yet untitled sequel is sure to include that it's almost incomprehensible anyone in their right mind took this on as a challenging endeavor they'd be willing to try their hand at. And say what you will about Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors of Winter Soldier, Civil War, and now both the third and what will be the fourth Avengers movies, and how they might feel like Marvel's \"directors for hire\" that bend at any whim studio head Kevin Feige commands, but these guys get the work done and do so in a way that is both dramatically satisfying as well as colossally entertaining. With Infinity War, the Russo brothers along with series screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (all three Captain America films, Thor: The Dark World, as well as Agent Carter) have somehow managed to tackle the unenviable for them, but extremely exciting for audiences in the vein of making eighteen previous movies come together and intertwine in a way that is as natural as possible with clear motivation as to why as much is necessary at this point in time all while keeping it all, as Thanos would put it, \"well-balanced.\" Where to begin in such an endeavor is certainly not a question with an obvious answer, but Markus and McFeely begin in what feels like the most natural of places given the hints that have been being dropped since that post-credits scene in 2012's The Avengers and where we last saw Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) after the destruction of their home world, Asgard. If you haven't been paying attention, the aforementioned post-credits scene delivered a slight smirk by a guy named Thanos (Josh Brolin) AKA a titan who sees fit to invade planets and wipe out half of their population in order to keep balance among the galaxies. This is who Infinity War centers around and in more ways than one this is Thanos' movie. This is a smart decision as this was never going to be able to be one heroes movie more than another's, but by giving this villain who we've been hearing whisperings about for almost six years now the credit he is due the movie allows this antagonist to live up to the mythos those past movies have built around him.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com","displayName":"Philip P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1025970122/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-09T10:42:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-09T10:42:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"783764844","realm":"RT","displayName":"Philip P","accountLink":"/user/id/783764844"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The ending was surprising ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-09T05:01:45.011Z","updateDate":"2018-07-09T05:01:45.011Z","user":{"userId":"260161991","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260161991"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Is a very very good movie heartbreaking but also amazing on the same levels.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-09T04:57:49.416Z","updateDate":"2018-07-09T04:58:35.741Z","user":{"userId":"973631318","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/973631318"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie, I really like the plot twist at the end.

Let's talk about Thanos. For about 10 years now, we've been told numerous times to be afraid of the mad titan without seeing him actually do anything to fear. Enter Infinity War, he is the best. No question. Josh Brolin is on par with Heath Ledger in this role as one of the greatest villains of all time. There's nothing quite like the action in this film. At times there is so much going on that you wouldn't think you'd be able to process all of it. The way this ends left me speechless and I'll be biting my nails for the next year until Avenger 4 hit theaters. ?This film was everything I hoped it would be, a fun ride, an emotional heart to it at the core, and overall a thrilling experience.","displayName":"Ethan V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-08T06:10:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-10T13:26:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"943597127","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ethan V","accountLink":"/user/id/943597127"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Lots of problems throughout, but what they achieved is truly epic.
