Visually it is superb with excellent special effects and settings throughout, and there is the right amount of humour spread across the characters.  The plot transitions from the different group of heroes well, and manages to balance the story with the action - the slower, emotional scenes often have the same impact than the large scale and explosive actions scenes.  However, the same criticisms of the Marvel series of movies are still there - the heroes are thrown about seemingly to no consequence, the plot just trundles along at times with little respite, and some of the fight scenes are so quick so you can't see the action.","displayName":"Sam W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/814035507/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T06:30:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T06:31:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"790333660","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sam W","accountLink":"/user/id/790333660"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I waited 10 years to see the most star studded action film in history.

I don't understand how any professional critic worth their merit can dock points based on it being \"too much,\"   \"too many characters on screen,\" or \"not enough dialogue.\" This is a spectacle film with the ground work being laid for over a decade. Marvel cannot just keep starting over every single movie for people who choose to not watch the other films in the series. Then we would eventually had 2 hours of crap thats already been shown in other movies and 15 minutes of new material. I'm sure your review scores would love that. Anyways, if you like fun, go watch this movie.","displayName":"Jeremy P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002173362501/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T06:29:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T06:36:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"972629025","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeremy P","accountLink":"/user/id/972629025"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely shattered every typical superhero action movie trope and exceeded my best case scenario expectations.

The action is good, and the jokes are okay, but the movie doesn't stay long enough with anyone to build an emotional attachment to with this movie. Yes. We love us some Iron Man and Hulk. But it doesn't help when the movie attempts to build a \"quick\" edge of your seat scene, but then switches to a different super hero.\nAlso, where does the Marvel Universe go from this film when every super hero and the most powerful villain in the Universe is on display?\nThe biggest gripe I have with the movie though is the inclusion of Wakanda and some of the characters from Wakanda. The Cap and the other superheroes arrived in Wakanda, the city didn't seem real as if the scene had been added at the last minute because of the success of the Black Panther film. For me, I felt Shuri and some of the other character and added scene in Wakanda was thrown in at the last minutes. Yes. I love revisiting Wakanda, but it all felt rushed, and stuck in for the audience. \nSPOILER HERE. (Don't read the rest of this if you haven't seen the film and don't want a surprise) There will be a part 2 to this film. Since the first part wasn't very good, I don't see myself going to the theatre to the second part. I'll wait for the DVD.","displayName":"Mitchell%20 T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T06:26:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T06:35:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"976751511","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mitchell%20 T","accountLink":"/user/id/976751511"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazingly well done.
