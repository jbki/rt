Marvel really doesn't hold back with the 'deaths'. Thanos is also probably my new favourite villain along with Loki and vulture who now seem so small compared to thanos himself. At times it does feel like a Thanos movie ,which I don't mind. The ending is probably the best ending to any film ever IMO purely because of how moving the last few moments are and how we are left on such a cliffhanger where the villain comes out on top waiting for avengers 4 .","displayName":"Unknown P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T14:19:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T14:24:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246514","realm":"RT","displayName":"Unknown P","accountLink":"/user/id/977246514"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this film and believe that the potential for Avengers 4 is high. So many plot routes could have been taken and although my inner marvel nerd isn't fully satisfied, I still thought the way they chose was self aware and not overbearing. I am excited to see how the next film plays out and which of the many marvel characters to choose from, they bring into the mcu.

The plot is simple: Thanos, portrayed by a wonderfully malicious Josh Brolin, is hunting down the Infinity Stones.  These stones, when gathered, will allow him to wipe out half of the universe's population because he sees it as an act to balance out the cosmos.  The only ones to stand in his way are the plethora of heroes who hold the remaining stones of course.  A simple plot played out very well through the entire run-time.   \nThere is an incredible sense of dread throughout; boosted by the presence of an equally terrifying villain in Thanos.  He will do anything he can to get his hands on the stones and it will show, making him one of the best antagonists to come from the MCU.  He simply is the biggest threat they have yet to face.\nThe film manages to handle a substantial variety of characters in a single outing quite well. Everyone seemingly gets equal screen time, with no one character feeling like an unnecessary lead.  The interactions between characters that never met before are wonderful, with Chris Hemsworth and Bradley Cooper stealing the show with their respective characters' banter.  The entire movie, which had the monumental task of taking being at the end of a funnel of cinematic events, manages to feel simply organic as the next step in the cinematic universe.  Infinity War takes massive strides during its runtime, leaving me rather breathless when the credits began to roll.  What will happen in the next movie is up in the air, but I welcome it.","displayName":"Theron H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T14:17:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T19:52:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246508","realm":"RT","displayName":"Theron H","accountLink":"/user/id/977246508"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Okay so I just got done reading “the Salons” opinion, to which I say; “you’re full of shit”! This movie is at time a mess, I can agree with you on that. But this movie plus the one next year is a cumulation of marvel studio, which took 10 years! And yes if you’re the average joe nobody who walked into a movie theater and just picked this movie by chance and hadn’t seen the other films leading up to Avengers Infinity Wars. You’d probably leave scathing your head going “wtf did I just watch?” But what you seem to not understand is it wasn’t for the Joe Nobody’s, it was fans. The people who have been watching since day one when Iron Man first came out. Thanos is by far the best villain the Marvel studios has brought to life next Loki and Killmonger. Over all this movie is great! the final battles, yes battles with a “s” are everything you could hope for and the meeting of the Averages with Guardians of the Galaxy was just pure awesomeness!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T14:17:08.775Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T14:17:08.775Z","user":{"userId":"260089585","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260089585"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing.
