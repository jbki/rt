Well I can't say much about the film, but as far as I know, it brings all of its characters from previous Marvel Cinematic Universe films and unite them together to face their biggest threat out of all the villains from the previous films. The way this film is executed from start to end is why I recommend you start watching Avengers: Infinity War in case you haven't yet.","displayName":"EpicLadySponge t","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T04:39:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T04:57:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"971407578","realm":"RT","displayName":"EpicLadySponge t","accountLink":"/user/id/971407578"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Not a single dull moment.

After 10 years of buildup, the MCU was finally climaxing to this moment, and it was worth it. While I frequent the rotten tomatoes website, I've never bothered to write a review ever for any movie I've watched, good or bad. But this movie was just so much that I couldn't resist but to write one. I was breathing heavily throughout the whole movie with butterflies in my stomach. I've never had this feeling while watching a movie before in my life - it was like I was playing in a sports game. My review will be a spoiler-free one, but I will reference some common knowledge that was released before the movie.\nThe execution of this movie was unreal. Every decision made in this movie had a reason behind it and the audience was made aware of that reason (or should I say, every marvel fan that's been following the MCU will. I don't really care about the casual goer that hasn't kept up with the other movies). There is a natural progression in how every aspect of the movie unfolds. For example, the reason Thanos consciously chooses to stop wearing his armor (common knowledge from trailers and Russo brothers interviews) just makes sense. The action scenes in this movie were unreal. It shows that they focused a lot on CGI, because this is the first time I've truly been able to disillusion myself in a movie to believe that these CGI scenes could actually be real. Reading other people's reactions before going, I got the sense that the jokes in the movie were actually very natural. In this aspect, I disagree. I personally feel that a lot of the jokes in the movie were indeed forced. Were they still funny? Yes. Did they provide comic relief? Yes. But I still felt a good amount of them just weren't necessary and felt awkward at times. This is my personal opinion, as the whole crowd was dying of laughter at literally every joke that was made. And of course, in the midst of all those jokes, there were ones that even I felt were natural and couldn't help myself but crack up. This movie had such a deep theme to it that had me and my discussing about it for hours after the movie and kept me up at night trying to process everything. Finally, I want to conclude my short review by commending a specific actor: Chris Hemsworth. It was revealed before the release that Thor would be one of the 3 or so characters with the most screen time. And Chris Hemsworth capitalized on every single moment he was on screen for. I personally believe he was the best actor in this movie. He's come such a long way from his stint in the first Thor movie. Back then, it was pretty obvious that he just wasn't a good actor. Now, you can't say that anymore. Between Ragnarok and this movie, Hemsworth has established himself as a true actor that's versatile: comedy, emotions, etc.","displayName":"Jon C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T04:34:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T04:56:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241915","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jon C","accountLink":"/user/id/977241915"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"If you don’t like this movie, you suck..it has everything ...so well done!
