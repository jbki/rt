Each line, every scene, like a gear, takes its place in this mechanism. Stupid characters make critical mistakes, smart characters play long-playing plans, all atypical decisions of the characters have justifications that are imperceptible at first glance, and all the plot holes are filled with an existing MCU plot base. Unlike all previous Avengers movies, watching this movie doesn't make sense without knowing the previous franchise films, but this is its uniqueness.\nWhat work has been done in these 10 years and how harmoniously it is connected in its pre-climax is worthy of respect.","displayName":"Daniel S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T15:18:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T09:12:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"935591444","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel S","accountLink":"/user/id/935591444"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The ending ruined the movie.

I found myself nodding off though, maybe tiredness, maybe age, maybe information overload. There seemed to be several films and TV series that could have been made out of this. The plot was confusing. And some appaling imposibilities. Despite or because of all that I want to see the film again, maybe in a less crowded cinema, and purely for the spectacle. Really really hated the villian motivation ... that the universe was overpopulated and he needed to eliminate half of every population across the universe. The universe overpopulated.
