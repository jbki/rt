Russo brothers were incredible by making sure every character got their own moment in the spotlight.. action scenes were awesome. but the story had a heartbeat so very emotional moments that you may not expect from a movie like this and good comedy not forced or over the top. I'll probably see this movie again before it leaves the theaters.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T04:51:58.039Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T04:51:58.039Z","user":{"userId":"974971036","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/974971036"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"as a huge fan of Marvel, I am so saddened and disappointed by this colossal mess of a movie. it had gaping plot holes, seemed to forget other MCU films at times, and underutilized its best heroes. such a shame.

The only redeeming points of the movie is the edge of your seat action and the moral discussion that the movie poses. As the final credits began to roll I was left with the question; What is the value of life and who gets to decide who lives or dies. History is full of people who assumed they were qualified to make that decision. Now there's an alien that thinks the way to save the galaxies is to eliminate half of it's population.","displayName":"Dale N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T04:50:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T05:42:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"975995312","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dale N","accountLink":"/user/id/975995312"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Didn't like it at all.
