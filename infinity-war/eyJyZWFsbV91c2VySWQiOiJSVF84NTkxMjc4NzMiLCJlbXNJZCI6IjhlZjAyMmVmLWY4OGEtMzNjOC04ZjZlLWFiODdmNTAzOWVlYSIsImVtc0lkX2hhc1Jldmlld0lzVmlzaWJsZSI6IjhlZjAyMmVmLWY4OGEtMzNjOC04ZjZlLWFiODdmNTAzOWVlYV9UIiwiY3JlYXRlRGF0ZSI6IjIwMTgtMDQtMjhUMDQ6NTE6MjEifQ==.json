Running at 2 hours and 40 minutes it's crammed with action. Although predictable at some points the film tends to surprise the viewer past the 2 hours and thirty minute mark. The \"twist\" at the end was surprising but will be rendered meaningless after it's sequel comes out in 2019","displayName":"John D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T04:49:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T04:55:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245304","realm":"RT","displayName":"John D","accountLink":"/user/id/977245304"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Undoutably a good movie.

Well worth the wait.  DC take notes. This is epic storytelling. I am glad they didn't rush to Thanos. Ten years in the making and they freaking pulled it off. I can't believe they pulled it off.... I read the infinity gauntlet story in the comics while in high school in the 80s and never thought we'd see it on screen.
