No spoilers I promise. If you have enjoyed the previous avengers, take that and your favorite characters with you on a journey that surrounds Thanos story. Basically this is his origin film. From a comic perspective it was everything I thought it would be and more. If you are not a comic geek, you will not appreciate it as much... it is a high energy, fast pace, nonstop action film that will break your heart..., but it will also give you hope. It’s setting up for something even bigger. Until next time, as they say it. I give the film a 9 out of 10, only because I hate “to be continued” movies. Well done on the story and well done being the first movie ever to have so many top characters/actors in such s large film. Of course you will need to stay through the credits, and when you do... you are going to be fired up for things to come. A- rating. #CaptainMarvel","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-24T00:40:59.265Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T21:09:24.409Z","user":{"userId":"942596651","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/942596651"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Very good.

The history behind it all the depth in which they dove to make Thanos a living breathing character. If there was ever any doubt, it’s long faded now and official... the Russo’s know what they’re doing. Bravo. Even with my major criticisms of the film I am in awe at this undertaking. A film with this many “main” characters should NOT work and yet here we are. Pure Thematic entertainment at its best. Well done. Seeing it again next Saturday.
