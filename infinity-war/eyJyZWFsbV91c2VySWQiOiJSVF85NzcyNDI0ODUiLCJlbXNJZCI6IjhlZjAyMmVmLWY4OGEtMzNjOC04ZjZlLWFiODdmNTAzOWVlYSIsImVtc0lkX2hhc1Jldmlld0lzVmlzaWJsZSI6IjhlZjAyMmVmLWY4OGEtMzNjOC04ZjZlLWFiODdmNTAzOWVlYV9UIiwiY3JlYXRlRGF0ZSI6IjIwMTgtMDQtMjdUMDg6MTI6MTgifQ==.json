This movie shows the Consequences of being a super hero and the risks you take as becoming an Avenger!

Bold moves. Death. Destruction. Chaos. Mayhem. Dark. Violent. I loved that aspect. Run-time was a little heavy. Thanos was handled well. CGI issues throughout and some wasted opportunities kept it from a perfect score. 3/10 Rewatchability Factor.\nCritics finally delivered KARMA to Marvel Studios.

It more than a comic book movie. AIW shouldn't be this great with everything that it had to balance. They knocked it out the park. I've seen it twice already, and i plan on watching it probably 4 more times. this is a once in a lifetime cinematic experience that everyone would enjoy. Box Office projection i think it would cross 2 billion.","displayName":"Zwade D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10154357753213314/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T08:05:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T08:10:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"976174938","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zwade D","accountLink":"/user/id/976174938"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This movie was more than I could have ever imagined!
