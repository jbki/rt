Seeing the characters you love and been following from these different films, in the same movie and interacting with one another is amazing. But that's not the only thing you should see the movie for; The heroes, the villain, the characters, the VFX, the action scenes, the soundtrack, the emotional moments, and fight scenes are glorious. It's everything you want in a comic book movie.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1954646014865685/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T21:11:32.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T21:20:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247328","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977247328"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A decade of story-telling leads to one of the year superhero films of the year. Humor, Breath-taking, Dark, Heart-breaking are emotions of the movie. It is a roller coaster of emotions. It is not like previous MCU movies, it goes straight to war. Comic fans should definitely see it, to the casual viewer probably not. There is so much that it has been covered in the others so, starting with this could be confusing. Loved this movie! Josh Brolin nails his performance as the mad titan, Thanos. \"The End Is Near\" was right! 5/5","displayName":"Chris A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T21:10:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T21:33:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"977235955","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris A","accountLink":"/user/id/977235955"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I LOVE THE AVENGERS ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T21:10:28.219Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T21:11:40.826Z","user":{"userId":"260123455","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260123455"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"OS MONSTROS TAMBÃ‰M AMAM !","displayName":"Arildo R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T21:09:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-20T19:59:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"906445176","realm":"RT","displayName":"Arildo R","accountLink":"/user/id/906445176"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie definitely wasn't for everyone, you had to be a fan after watching the previous movies and get to know all characters (at least all important ones).
