When matched with this boat load of characters the writers manage to give the characters more development and expands upon past movies interpretation those characters. THANOS, easily the best mcu villain with being menacing and extremly powerfull with tons of layers. The acting absolutely transforms these characters. Overall this is a cinematic achievement and demands you see it on the big screen.

Les personnages ont quasiment tous leur petit moment de gloire, même ceux qui ne sont là que quelques minutes (Scarlett Johansson a dû tourner une seule après-midi, Idris Elba ne devait même pas être sur le plateau). La seule chose qui gâche vraiment l'ensemble est la communication autour du film, qui annihile tout danger pour les personnages dont on a annoncé la présence dans des films ultérieurs. En tuant tout sens de danger, Marvel atténue toute l'émotion d'un film qui ne demande que cela. Dommage.","displayName":"Camille L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/772168443/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T06:24:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T06:30:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"826015906","realm":"RT","displayName":"Camille L","accountLink":"/user/id/826015906"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome, amazing, incredible and I don't have words I love the movie","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/319734681888402/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T06:24:32.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T06:25:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"977242200","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977242200"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Just as much fun as Thor Ragnarok.

It has you going though all the emotions that you would think that you would have for these characters that you got to know over the 10 years that the MCU has been around. You laugh, gasp, choke up, get fired up,  and even ask, 'Wait... What the...?\" Just awesome!
