The movie was setting in a lot of places like: Central Park,Georgia , Atlanta, United Kingdom, Scotland, Edinburgh, New York, Berwickshire and Train station Warenley.\n\nAvenger 3: Infinity War have 76 principals characters, in them: The guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers the olds and the news, Black Panther, etc. But the people were more fixed in Ironman, Captain America, Bruce Banner, Thor, Thanos, Vision, Black Widow.\n\nThe movie is about the Guardians of the Galaxy, Black Panther, Avengers the new and the olds, Wakanda saving the Universe of Thanos that want to destroy the half of the population in the Universe, so our heroes are going to sarificated all to prevent that. I think that the movie is good because mark like a time in the line time of Marvel.\n\nIt have a good cinematography, i think that they made a god mix of colors in the suits and in the background of the movie and the cameras was good and I like the form they record, they do it in good angle. Itdont have to much songs but in the enter of Ironman and Thor i like that songs. Special effects was amazing I they do it very good. Special effects that the movie transfer was saddest because of the deaths of a lot of characters.\n\nI give to the movie an 10 because it was all what I expected of Marvel, because this movie it has been doing since 2016. I think that they would be happy because of the time that the Marvel Company takes to do this movie exactly how people want it.
