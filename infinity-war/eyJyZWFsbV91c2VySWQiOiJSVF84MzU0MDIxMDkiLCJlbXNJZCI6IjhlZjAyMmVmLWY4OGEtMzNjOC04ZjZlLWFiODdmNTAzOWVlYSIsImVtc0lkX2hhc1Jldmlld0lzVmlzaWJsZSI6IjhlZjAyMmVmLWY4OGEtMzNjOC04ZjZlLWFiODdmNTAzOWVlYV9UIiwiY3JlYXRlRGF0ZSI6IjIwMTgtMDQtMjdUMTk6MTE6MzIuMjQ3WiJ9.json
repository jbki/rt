The way the characters interact was perfect (ex: Iron Man and Dr. Strange’s egos causing them to disagree). Thanos is the best villain seen in a movie in a long time, he’s not just a bad guy because he’s “bad”. He actually thinks he’s the good guy in his story. The music was on point. And they showcased a large line up of hero’s without it ever feeling like it was too much. Possibly the best MCU movie to date and defiantly in the top five.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T19:04:51.318Z","updateDate":"2018-05-04T18:58:33.276Z","user":{"userId":"260004702","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260004702"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One word about the movie - EPIC\nDon't let the bad reviews intimidate you perception about the movie guys.
