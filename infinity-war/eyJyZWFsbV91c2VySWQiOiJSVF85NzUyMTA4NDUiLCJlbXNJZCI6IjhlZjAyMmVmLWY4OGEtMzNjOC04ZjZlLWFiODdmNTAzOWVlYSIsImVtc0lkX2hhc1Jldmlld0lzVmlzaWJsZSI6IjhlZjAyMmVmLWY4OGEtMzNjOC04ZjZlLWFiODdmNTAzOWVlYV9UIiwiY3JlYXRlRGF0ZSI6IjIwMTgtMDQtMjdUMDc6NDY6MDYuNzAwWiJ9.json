Some minor issues but nothing that broke the movie. \nWhen you pay attention to the details it connects so well!!\nThe darkest MCU movie ever and rightfully so! Even the signature opening for the MCU movies began with a dark tone rather than its usual upbeat and triumphant music that plays as the characters are on display! \nIt was a bit more fast-paced than what fans are probably used to with MCU movies yet, \nit was able to deliver multiple times! \nThanos is what he should be! Strong, Powerful, Intimidating, Brooding \nand a Fierce Warrior. He proved his might clearly within the first 5 minutes just as Marvel Studios' President, Kevin Feige had promised! Whenever he collected one of the Infinity Stones, he used each of them in a unique and powerful way. He had the guts to do what others could not do in order for planets to survive. He was the example of sheer will and determination. He would let nothing stand in the way of his mission. He would torture and kill to fulfill what he thought was right. He had some lines of dialogue where you could see multiple layers of depth that makes him who he is and his reasoning. Yet, he still seemed to love no one outside of Gamora! This guy was COMPLEX!!\n10 years..And Marvel paid us off nicely!! I've seen it twice already! \nAvoid all spoilers, don't ask anyone what happens in the movie!! Go see this movie for yourself!! \nMarvel Studios..You did it again!! \n(It is going to be a long year waiting for part 4)\n#GoldenAgeOfSuperHeroMovies","displayName":"Tony C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001206177092/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T07:44:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T11:48:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"971466108","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tony C","accountLink":"/user/id/971466108"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The perfect culmination to the greatest movie series of all time. beautiful cinematography and action all the way through ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T07:44:48.688Z","updateDate":"2018-05-24T06:18:41.097Z","user":{"userId":"260121714","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260121714"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie 10 years in the making.
