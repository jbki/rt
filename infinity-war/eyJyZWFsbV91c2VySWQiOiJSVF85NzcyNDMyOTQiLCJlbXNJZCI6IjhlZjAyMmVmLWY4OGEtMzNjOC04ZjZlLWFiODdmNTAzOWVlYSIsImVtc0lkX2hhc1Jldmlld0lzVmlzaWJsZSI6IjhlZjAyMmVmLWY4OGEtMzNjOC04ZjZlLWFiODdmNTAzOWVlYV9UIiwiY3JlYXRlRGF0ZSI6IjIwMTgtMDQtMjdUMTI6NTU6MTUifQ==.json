They did an outstanding job of combining the stories from all the other Marvel's films into this epic film. I was captivated thru out this whole film.\n\nAll I ask is that when part two comes out there are no previews released, no information released. Right now everyone who walked out is probable stones and letting their imagination running g wild.  That alone will drag everyone  back to see the second part.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10215709639471352/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T12:54:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T13:09:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243292","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977243292"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolute classic.

It was funny, yet emotional and serious at the same time. It takes itself more serious than any other MCU movie they have made, which is to be expected considering the magnitude of the situation they're facing; Thanos and the Infinity Stones. The only problem I have with it is having to constantly switch from one character to another, but considering they have over 30 different main characters they do an excellent job with what they have. It's a movie that goes to the right lengths, and it accomplishes everything and more for me.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1861252040841188/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T12:50:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T12:54:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243284","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977243284"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's so easy when you have runaway hype to go into a movie expecting more. This isn't Avengers 3 - it's sequel 19. This is a climax to 10 years of storytelling, it relies on that knowledge. Critics want it to slow down to savour emotional plot points, but it doesn't have to at all. I GET some of the criticisms (they are small) and obviously no film is 100% perfect. Thanos was deep.\n\nOvercome. A lot to digest. Holy hell. \n\nPerfectly balanced ensemble piece that took serious risks and was very unexpected. Well paced - FAST paced. This was for the fans and its great. Wonderful film making.","displayName":"Sam L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T12:48:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T16:20:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"976527877","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sam L","accountLink":"/user/id/976527877"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Packed with action, surprises and romance.
