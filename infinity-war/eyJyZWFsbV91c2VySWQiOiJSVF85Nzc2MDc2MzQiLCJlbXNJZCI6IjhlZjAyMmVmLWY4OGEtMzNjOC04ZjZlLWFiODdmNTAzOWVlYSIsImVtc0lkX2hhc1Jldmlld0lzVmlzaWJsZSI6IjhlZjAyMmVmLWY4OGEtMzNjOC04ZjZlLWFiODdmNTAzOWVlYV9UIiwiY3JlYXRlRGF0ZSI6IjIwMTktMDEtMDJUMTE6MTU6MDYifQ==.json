From the sentimentalism the characters make you feel to the edge of your seat scenes you cannot look away from.

There are parts of the MCU which are amazing standalone stories, Iron Man, Captain America. This is the third disappointment for me with the avengers storyline. Long winded, dry, boring dialogue. And ridiculously dramatic over drawn out CGI fight sequences.\n\nFor all the same reasons that the Transformer movies  started out great but quickly became stale and formulaic, this Avengers movie has hit the stale yet again. \n\nUltron was borderline for me.  Civil War was painfully dreadful.  This hit another low.  Two hours of my life that ill never get back.  Shame on Marvel for just creating a juggernaut series and then feeding their fans swill in attempts to sell tickets.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10158119904099464/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-31T16:57:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-31T17:02:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"977700832","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977700832"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 31, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"B?R GRUP ?NSANIN ARALARINDAK?
