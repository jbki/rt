Not to mention 2 dozen characters each trying to do at least one thing. This isnt by any means a bad movie, its just dissapointing, empty whilst being overstuffed, and 100% a cash grab. Sadly, the glory days of the Golden Age of Marvel is over.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1832611870169502/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T11:15:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T11:18:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243015","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977243015"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I thought it was a fine addition to the Marvel and Avengers collection.  However, it is unique in that it has very little re-watchability.  The 2 1/2 hour character fest allows for very little character engagement, the jam-packed story has very little nuance as we follow assortments of characters along various sub-quests, and its really a slog.  I purchased tickets in advance for Thurs openers, and Friday.  Saw Blade Runner 2049 seven times, Ragnarok five times, and have no intention of seeing this even a second time until just prior to the next one coming out.  Can't imagine sitting through it again.","displayName":"Tom E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1101481130/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T11:14:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T11:17:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"847857407","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tom E","accountLink":"/user/id/847857407"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great beginning to the Infinity War.

A lot of these characters storylines have been leading up to this massive face off while others where just pulled in to it. It manages to juggle around many different characters from the Guardians of the Galaxy to the Avengers coherently and with ease. On top of all the ongoing storylines, juggling around characters they manage to add in a lot of surprises. \nInfinity War is roller coaster ride of emotion and nonstop action that manages to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie and leaves you waiting for the end credit scene. It is as an epic comic book movie that cannot be compared to others in it genre. It goes above and beyond what other comic book movies do while keeping the stakes as high as they can go.\nThe best way to watch this movie is going in as blind as you can. Come in knowing barely anything and come out feeling in awe of the epicness you have just watched. \nThis is the movie of the year.","displayName":"Matt M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1806654569/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T11:13:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T11:51:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"956197196","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt M","accountLink":"/user/id/956197196"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie was awesome...best MCU movie to date.
