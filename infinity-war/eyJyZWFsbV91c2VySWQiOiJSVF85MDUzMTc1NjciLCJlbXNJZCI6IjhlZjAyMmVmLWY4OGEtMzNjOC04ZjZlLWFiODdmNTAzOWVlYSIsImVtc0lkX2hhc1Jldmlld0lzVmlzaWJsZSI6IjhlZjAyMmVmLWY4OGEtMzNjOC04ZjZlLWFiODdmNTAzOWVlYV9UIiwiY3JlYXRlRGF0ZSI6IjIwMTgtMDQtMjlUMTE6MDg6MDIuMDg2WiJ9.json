No movie structure just scenes, one after the other, from one place to the other, bringing us conclusions to the stories of the characters we have invested so much time and passion. This was the best way possible to deliver something like this and Marvel did it spectacularly.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10216303748451782/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T10:57:15.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T10:59:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248664","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977248664"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This Marvel movie uses the other 18 Marvel movies as exposition so that this movie can have epic battle sequences & cross over meetings between so many fan favorites.  The high stakes of the storyline and the consequences for each character will keep you at the edge of your seat.  This is a movie that must be watched in theaters.  I t is also worth the extra $ to watch it in IMAX 3D if you can.   My date and I loved it and the ending literally was jaw dropping.  The more of the 18 Marvel movies you have seen the more rewarding this film is.  It is perfect motivation to see the ones you missed and catch up either before or afterward.","displayName":"Michael F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T10:55:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T11:02:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"918429842","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael F","accountLink":"/user/id/918429842"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"you are not ready for Thanos","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10155781968540490/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T10:54:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T10:55:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"976954022","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976954022"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"absolutely the best film in the world","displayName":"Muriel E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T10:53:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T10:55:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248655","realm":"RT","displayName":"Muriel E","accountLink":"/user/id/977248655"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The most spectacular Marvel, scratch that, superhero movie of all time (yes better than The Dark Knight).
