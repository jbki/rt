It had humor and seriousness.  It was as good as I had hoped it would be.  My only problem at all is how much they are pushing the intelligence of black pather's sister.  I am fine with her being incredibly intelligent that is great and I am all for that.  But scientists have specialties and that is something that lacks I mcu, bruce banner knows all science as does tony stark, etc.  no one knows it all and then suddenly black panthers sister knows more than anyone about railways, auto piloted cars, armored super hero, suits and the human anatomy....

I always watched Marvel Movies in the same childlike glee I once had at a younger age, excited for the action and comedy but never really overly afraid or anxious of the outcome. More often than not, super hero movies end the way you expect them to, and with Marvel's formula of mirroring what makes a villain I just couldn't ever feel the edge of my seat. This movie however, blew all that out the water. If Marvel had childlike wonder, it surely doesn't anymore. This is the film where Marvel put on it's big boy pants and, as a self proclaimed DC lover, it beats every super hero movie out there. In one word, shocking. Just...shocking.","displayName":"Terry T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1034569473269574/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T04:25:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T04:29:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"973797001","realm":"RT","displayName":"Terry T","accountLink":"/user/id/973797001"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I absolutely loved this movie!!! it was exciting, visually amazing, shocking, and full of twists!!! it was better than I even expected!!!
