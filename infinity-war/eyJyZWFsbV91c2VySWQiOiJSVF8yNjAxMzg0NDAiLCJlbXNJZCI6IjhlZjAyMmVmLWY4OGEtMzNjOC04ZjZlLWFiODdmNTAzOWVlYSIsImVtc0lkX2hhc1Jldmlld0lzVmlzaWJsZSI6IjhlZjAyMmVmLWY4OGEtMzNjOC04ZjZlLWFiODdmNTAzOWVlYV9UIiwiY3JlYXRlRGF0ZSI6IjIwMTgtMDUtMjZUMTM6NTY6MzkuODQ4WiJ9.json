The emotion was unexplainable and the film was excellent at juggling the screen time fairly for all the loved characters. But the obvious star of the show for me and pretty much everyone was Thanos (delivered excellently by josh brolin) who was the dark character everyone knew from the comics. Overall 5 stars a must see and an instant turning point for the future of the MCU.","displayName":"Sam P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-26T13:47:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-26T13:58:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"977291049","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sam P","accountLink":"/user/id/977291049"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"The ambitious and latest installment of The MCU was a convoluted and slow paced mess.

Really?! They can spend five minutes trying to tug the gauntlet off and can sink an ax in his chest but they can't just cut off his arm?

Keep in mind that the last installment of the MCU was Ragnarok, a child-friendly PG-13 rated film and rightfully so. I loved the humour and character development and saw it five times at theatre, I've seen it 12 times total now. The installment before this film was Spider-Man: Home-coming which I also went to see and this movie was geared at children and young teens.\n\nInfinity War is NOT a children's film, and I can't believe Disney's family values would make a film like this one with rated R visuals and content. The opening scene showed burnt, dead bodies, specific close-ups of background characters from Ragnarok, not excluding the little girl Heimdall saved. Right when the logo broke away, began my horrors. The creative team of this movie did not spare a single realistic detail of Loki's torturous death scene: during the strangulation, his spine was broken, he was choked until his throat finally collapsed under Thano's gauntlet. There was makeup and digital intervention to showcase the following details: The blood veins in his eyes burst, his face and under eyelids swelled, and he had blood dripping from his mouth to indicate that he'd bit his tongue. His face changed colours throughout and his look of horror was beyond what my mind could take. After his body fell, there was presumably a prop used to capture the character's broken, lifeless body. They even went to the extent to dull the eyes and skin pigment and also to digitalize the human spell having been broken because he reverted back to his Frost Giant form.\n\nEqually disturbing was how the character of Ebony-Maw praised Thanos evil ways like he were a god, and the whole scene played Loki and Thor like victims and Thanos like a psychotic real-life killer. It was psychological and disturbing.\n\nIt was gruesome and filmed all in close-ups, not to mention the sadistic nature of the scenes and all others that followed, like Thor being bound and gagged to witness his little brother's torture and death.\n\nThere was x-ray vision supplied for the near bursting of Thor's skull and eye, as well as Doctor Strange's swelling face and accentuated blood veins and inner bruising. Another disturbing scene was with Nebula: where she was strung up and being yanked by her exposed, stretching tendons.\n\nThe character of Thanos, inappropriately put a knife in toddler Nebula's hand while her parents were slaughtered in the background, in a time where children are too easily susceptible to weapons and taking lives without care. What are our children supposed to feel coming out of this movie exactly? A villain who tortures and kills and creates genocide and we're supposed to relate with him why? Is there not enough division in society today without making a fictional character to divide a galaxy that doesn't exist and having him weed out the undesirables?\n\nI read several parents complaining that their children came out of the movie crying and one toddler after seeing it, played Thanos (the one toy left standing) having murdered all of the other figures.\n\nI rest my case.","displayName":"Ann R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10152308106415864/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-26T10:53:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-26T11:00:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"976383574","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ann R","accountLink":"/user/id/976383574"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"You can say it wasn't predictable, but in reality the movie just didn't follow through on the whole the hero saves the day plot scheme, so that is what made this movie somewhat enjoyable for me.","displayName":"John D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-26T10:26:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-26T10:27:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"965265383","realm":"RT","displayName":"John D","accountLink":"/user/id/965265383"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 26, 2018"}]}
