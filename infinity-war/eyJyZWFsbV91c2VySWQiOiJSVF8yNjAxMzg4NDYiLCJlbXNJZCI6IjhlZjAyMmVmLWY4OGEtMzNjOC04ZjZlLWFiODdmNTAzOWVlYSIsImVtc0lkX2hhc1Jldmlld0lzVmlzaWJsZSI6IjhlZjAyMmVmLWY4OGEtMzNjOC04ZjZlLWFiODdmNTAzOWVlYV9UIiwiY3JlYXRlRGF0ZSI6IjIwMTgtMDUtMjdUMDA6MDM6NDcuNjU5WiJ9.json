Only thing more narcissistic than Thanos is \"critic\" Anthony Lane and his review of the Marvel movie.  Instead of reviewing the movie, he is more occupied with showing how \"smart\" he is by listing literarily, film and psychological allusions.  If Mr. Lane's job was to bring to mind what you imagined a movie critic as a kid-pretentious and mean spirited for no reason-then mission accomplished.  Mr. Lane writes as if he's reviewing Christmas for Ebenezer Scrooge.  His paper is better left as some sort of school assignment.  Don't listen to critics and judge for yourself. Each of us has different tastes.  #thenewyorker #anthonylane","displayName":"Christian C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-26T21:01:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-26T21:20:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"977291758","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christian C","accountLink":"/user/id/977291758"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The bulk of the movie was very good however, the ending was a very cheap way to end it and stretch the movie into to parts.
