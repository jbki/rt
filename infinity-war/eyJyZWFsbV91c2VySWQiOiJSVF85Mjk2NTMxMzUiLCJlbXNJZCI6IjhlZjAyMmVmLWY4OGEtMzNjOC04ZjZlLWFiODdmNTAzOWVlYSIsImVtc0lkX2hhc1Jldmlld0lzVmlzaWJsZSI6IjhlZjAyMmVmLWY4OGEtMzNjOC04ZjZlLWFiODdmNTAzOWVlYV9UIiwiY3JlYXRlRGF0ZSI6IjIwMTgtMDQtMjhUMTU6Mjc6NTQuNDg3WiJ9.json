Most don't go along with the comics, and not as predictable as it seems. Great 2 and half movie, amazing turning points. I do not recommend sitting up close to the screen, you can't see some of the Easter eggs in it!?? As all marvel movies, there is an end credit to it, recommend watching it\n\nReally want deadpool to enter it, sadly it won't happen\nHave fun\n\nP.s.
