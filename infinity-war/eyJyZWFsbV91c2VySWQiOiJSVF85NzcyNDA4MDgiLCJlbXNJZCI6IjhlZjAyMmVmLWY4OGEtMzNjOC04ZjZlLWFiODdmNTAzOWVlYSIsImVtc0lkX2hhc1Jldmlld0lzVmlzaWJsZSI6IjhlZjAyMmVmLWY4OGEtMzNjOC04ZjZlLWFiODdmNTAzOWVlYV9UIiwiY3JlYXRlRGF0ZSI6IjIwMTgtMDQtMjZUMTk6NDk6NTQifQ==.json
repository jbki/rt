Highly anticipated and wasn't let down in the least.  Cheering from the crowded room at big moments makes me feel that my fellow movie goers weren't disappointed, either. The ending moments were haunting and almost breathtaking... maybe even tear jerking. Somewhat expected, yet unexpected at the same time. I'm not sure if that makes any sense, but it's the truth. A battle of the ages and I can't wait to see it again when the crowd dies down next week.","displayName":"Wesley K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T19:45:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T19:53:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"939695619","realm":"RT","displayName":"Wesley K","accountLink":"/user/id/939695619"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Am done with comic book movies after this fiasco.
