Within the context of the MCU, it's a masterpiece! No superhero movie, and few action movies in general, step outside of storytelling convention in such a daring way. The depth of the characters and plot trickle down to the rest of the MCU films, as foreshadowing and a central theme begin to appear in everything from the original Iron Man onward. Also, Thanos is f*cking terrifying and raises high stakes in the movie, which is something I never expect from stories revolving around action figures.","displayName":"Zach A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T23:38:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T23:40:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"909414102","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zach A","accountLink":"/user/id/909414102"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is the culmination of ten years of the MCU and the genius that went into it. Itâ€™s like the six Star Wars films wrapped into one. One cares about all of the characters, even the evil ones, which are all well-respected and well fleshed out.

They pulled it off and created a film that was a feast for the senses. I can't wait for the second installment. You have to know your character's before you go to the movie. Otherwise a lot of things won't make sense.  Marvel Studios did an amazing job of stitching all the stories together in a coherent 2.5 hour movie.","displayName":"Jon S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10206592331661808/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T23:09:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T23:11:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"972517828","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jon S","accountLink":"/user/id/972517828"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"can't wait for avengers 4","displayName":"stu r","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T22:59:14.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T23:01:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"977258715","realm":"RT","displayName":"stu r","accountLink":"/user/id/977258715"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Met almost all of my expectations. a very ambitious movie that could have easily spanned across three movies. it packs a lot into a neat two and a half hour package, and although I wish certain characters got more screentime, the movie left me feeling many different emotions.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T22:51:08.578Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T22:51:08.578Z","user":{"userId":"260127976","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260127976"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The only way you don't love this movie is if you don't like superheroes. \nMarvel does it better than ANYBODY!","displayName":"David C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T22:29:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T22:32:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"977039598","realm":"RT","displayName":"David C","accountLink":"/user/id/977039598"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"AWesome!
