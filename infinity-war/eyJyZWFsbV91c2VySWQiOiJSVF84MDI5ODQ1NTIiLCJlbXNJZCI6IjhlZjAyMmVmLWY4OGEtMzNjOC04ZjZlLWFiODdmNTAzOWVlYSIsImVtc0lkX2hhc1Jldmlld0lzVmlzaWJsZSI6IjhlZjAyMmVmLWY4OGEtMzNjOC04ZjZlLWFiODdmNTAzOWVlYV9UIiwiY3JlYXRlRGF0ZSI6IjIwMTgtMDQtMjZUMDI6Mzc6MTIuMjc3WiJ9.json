To say that this movie was epic is an understatement. Every Marvel movie was leading to this, and I was afraid that it would be underwhelming. With so many characters, with so much at stake, it would be perfectly understandable if the studio wasn't quite up for the task. It would be understandable for this movie to crumble under its own weight. The fact that the movie turned out to be amazing is nothing short of a miracle.\n\nYes, there are so many characters that we don't get to see much of everyone. But I felt that everyone was given his or her moment regardless of how little screen time they were given. That's the only downside about this movie, and you'd have to be nitpicking to point that out. The visuals and special effects were amazing. All the action sequences were intense and mind blowing. For the first time in an Avengers movie, I actually felt that there were a lot at stake. The tension was palpable in every scene. There were a lot of shocking and surprising scenes, the type that would make your jaws drop. And finally, we have a fully realized Marvel villain that you can empathize with. This is not your generic candy colored Marvel movie. It's refreshing that they decided to go all dark- it wouldn't fit the story line otherwise. It's intense, it's funny at times, it's highly emotional. It's a movie people will keep talking about long after they have left the movie theater. \n\nWhen I heard the Russo Brothers would be directing, I knew this movie was in good hands. After all, they directed the Marvel Movies that I really loved. Thanks to them, there's finally an Avengers Movie that I like. In fact I loved this movie so much, I'm itching to see it again. That's something i couldn't say about the majority of Marvel movies.","displayName":"Jeremiah D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/614304092/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T02:37:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T03:44:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"795404535","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeremiah D","accountLink":"/user/id/795404535"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What a payoff.

A non-stop spectacular that is masterfully directed, along with a magnificent score, properly impressive visual effects, and a plot that doesnt let up. It subverts your expectations and turns the usual formula on its head with game-changing consequences, and yet in classic Marvel fashion, still finds the right second to crack a smile on your face before leading to an ending that is one for the ages","displayName":"Bryan D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T02:14:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T02:29:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"914381474","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bryan D","accountLink":"/user/id/914381474"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was amazing!!

The characters we've come to love over 10 years gel effortlessly on screen, each with a distinct arc and everyone getting their own moment to shine. It should not be understated how big of a task the writers and directors had to make this work and by god do they make it work. The sprawling tones of the solo flicks somehow mesh so tightly in this one overarching narrative. \nIt is quite clunky to get out of the station in the opening 10 - 15 mins with the amount of characters we need to catch up on before we can depart but when it goes the film is like a runaway train hurtling from shock and awe to hilarity and strife with no time to breathe in between.\nThe ending 40 minutes are breathtaking and will be a major talking point for the next year until Avengers 4 hits our screens so watch it before you can be spoiled. \nAt this point you do wonder can Marvel do no wrong? No, Doesn't look like it.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10206892723619692/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T02:03:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T02:22:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"977239285","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977239285"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wow!
