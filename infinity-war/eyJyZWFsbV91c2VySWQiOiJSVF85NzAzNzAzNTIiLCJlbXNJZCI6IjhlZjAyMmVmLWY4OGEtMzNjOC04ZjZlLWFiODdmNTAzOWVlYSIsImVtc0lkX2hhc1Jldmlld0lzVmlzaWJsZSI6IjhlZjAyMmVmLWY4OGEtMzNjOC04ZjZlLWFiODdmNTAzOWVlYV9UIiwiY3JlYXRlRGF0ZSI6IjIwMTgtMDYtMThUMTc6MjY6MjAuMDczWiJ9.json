It felt a bit long to me. I don't understand the need to make 2.5 hour action movies. We also re-learned that Spiderman is a good character as long as it's in small quantities.","displayName":"Mario M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/518074457/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-18T16:15:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-18T16:30:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"803909054","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mario M","accountLink":"/user/id/803909054"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I almost always feel like a kid again when I sit down to watch a Marvel movie.

Even if they did lie and say it would NOT be a two-parter. It definitely is. The ending, when I saw it the first time, left me a bit irked... but ONLY because I knew about all of the other projects in the works and that took away some of the impact.\nStill, a solid movie with fun and action and surprises.\nThe Thor arc remains my favorite part of the film.","displayName":"A.m.
