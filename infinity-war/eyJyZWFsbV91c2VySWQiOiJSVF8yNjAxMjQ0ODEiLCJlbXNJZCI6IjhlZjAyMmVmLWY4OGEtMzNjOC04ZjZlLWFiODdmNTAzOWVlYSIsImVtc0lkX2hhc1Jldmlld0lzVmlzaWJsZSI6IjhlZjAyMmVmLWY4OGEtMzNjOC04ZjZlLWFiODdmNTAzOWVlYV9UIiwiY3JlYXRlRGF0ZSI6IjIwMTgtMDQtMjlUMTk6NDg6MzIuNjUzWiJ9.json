They did a great job at tying the Marvel universe together, science and magic, space and Earth. I really liked Thanos as a villain. The best baddies are either tragic or surprisingly vulnerable and human. Much better than his comic book version, who basically wanted to wipe out the universe for a chick. My only nitpick is that the movie has HUGE ramifications for the rest of the shared Marvel universe. How is the Ant Man movie going to address this? Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.? The Netflix shows?","displayName":"Ron T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/50903138/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T19:38:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T19:47:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"783638559","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ron T","accountLink":"/user/id/783638559"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Not the best Marvel Movie but an amazing accomplishment given how many heroes and plots needed to be juggled... and dealing with ridiculous power levels due to Thanos being on a different level per the comics.  Well done.  Must see if you've watched the other Marvel movies.  Dark, but not ridiculously dark and gritty like everyone in the DC universe is... and the characters earn their respect (unlike the characters in The Last Jedi).","displayName":"Joe P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T19:36:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T14:18:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"977179787","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joe P","accountLink":"/user/id/977179787"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"cosa linda, cosa bien hecha","displayName":"Sebastián M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10210593181039744/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T19:36:32.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T19:36:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"976272443","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sebastián M","accountLink":"/user/id/976272443"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Greatest Movie Of All time","displayName":"Brian J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T19:35:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T19:36:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"976890302","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian J","accountLink":"/user/id/976890302"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Been waiting a long time for this one..
