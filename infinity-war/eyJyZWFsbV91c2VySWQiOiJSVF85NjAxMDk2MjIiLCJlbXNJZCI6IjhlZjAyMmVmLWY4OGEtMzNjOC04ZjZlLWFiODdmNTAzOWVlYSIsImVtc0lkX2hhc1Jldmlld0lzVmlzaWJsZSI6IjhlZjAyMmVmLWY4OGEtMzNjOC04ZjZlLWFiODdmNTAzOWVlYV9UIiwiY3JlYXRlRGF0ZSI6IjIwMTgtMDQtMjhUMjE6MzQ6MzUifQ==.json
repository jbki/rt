The Russo Brothers knock it out of the park again! This film is victorious in evenly spreading out journeys of each the character groups and individuals. Its major achievement: EMOTIONAL INVESTMENT.  There was JOY! There was LAUGHTER! Then a WHOLE LOTTA PAIN! You know that you've done an amazing job when your audience develops a personal disdain for the movie's antagonist. You also know that you've done an amazing job when you have the audience yearning for answers. \n\nHowever, it would've been good to see certain loose end's tied up between characters, recalling previous MCU entries. But that would just overflow the pot of boiling water which is Infinity War. Other than that, AMAZING JOB Joe and Anthony Russo!

The 26 different plot lines never connected, that characters from previous Marvel films fell flat against their character development and left us wanting.  But the worst part was the lack of cohesiveness of the story line for over 2 hours.  IT FAILED TO CLIMAX AND  the HERO'S DID NOTHING! It was the MOST UNSATISFYING MOVIE IN DECADES.  Save your money and let this bloated production die under its underwhelming weight.  \n\nI was originally drawn in by the Captain America series and then the by the Guardians of the Galaxy, but this film was a waste of time.  My parting thoughts were that I wanted my money and the last three hours of my life back.  With the lead actors opening stating they will not be in future films of the franchise, I can understand why.  The writing in this film was terrible and the ending so absolutely absurd that there is no way that I would care to bother with this movie studio.  One has to wait until after the credits for even get a glimpse of a continuation or remote idea of a cliff hanger with the teaser for Capt. Marvel, but that is too little too late.  I am done with Marvel and highly recommend you save your money for quality entertainment worthy of your $50.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10216702311293352/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T21:22:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T21:40:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247347","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977247347"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This was a great movie.  If you're into how well the plot holds up you're going to need to watch most of the MCU movies or you wont understand much of what is going on.  This is not a movie for the casual fan of the MCU.\n    That being said, I was amazed at the further character development the writers were able to pull off with the heroes.  The crowning achievement of the movie is the character development of Thanos.  He wasn't just some static canned villain.  We learned his motives, passions, and desires.\n   This is a great movie.","displayName":"Michael M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T21:18:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T04:57:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"977188604","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael M","accountLink":"/user/id/977188604"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
