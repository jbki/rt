Fun to see all these characters come together, it's a credit to what Marvel has done to get to this point. But Let's be real. It's not a perfect film. And it doesn't have to be. This move should get a pass from reviews. Not just b/c who cares what a critic thinks... but also b/c it's not meant to be a normal movie. It's a conclusion to a never-before-attempted ongoing story arc connecting tons of films and characters. It's a moving comic book. Just let it be what it is and everyone can still enjoy the Oscars and Cannes.","displayName":"Tom W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/502297866/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T12:21:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T12:01:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"877064577","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tom W","accountLink":"/user/id/877064577"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"lo mejor en el mundo","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/234088944003926/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T12:20:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T12:21:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248851","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977248851"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I just saw Infinity War, and it blew me away.
