They tried too hard with the emotional scenes especially with Thanos.

I haven’t seen anything like this. I was surprised and taken aback by how dark the story was. All of the other previous Avengers film were just placeholders for this event and i have to say that it was worth the wait. I was surprised by how heavy the emotional weight was.
