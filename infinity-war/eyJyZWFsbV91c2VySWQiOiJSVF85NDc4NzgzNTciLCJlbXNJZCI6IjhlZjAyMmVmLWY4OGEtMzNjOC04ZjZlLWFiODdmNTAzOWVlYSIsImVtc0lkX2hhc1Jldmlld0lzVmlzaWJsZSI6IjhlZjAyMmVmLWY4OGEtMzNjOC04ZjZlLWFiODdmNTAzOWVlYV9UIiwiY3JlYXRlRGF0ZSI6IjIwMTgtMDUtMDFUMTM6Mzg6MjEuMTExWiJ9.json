Does Infinity War live up to its expectations? I say not only does it meet, but it also exceeds the expectations. The Russo Brothers gave us Captain America: Civil War, which also had a lot of characters and conflict to work with, and that ended up being one of the best MCU movies (my personal favorite). This movie is no exception. It's got all the action, humor, drama, and heartfelt moments you would want in a Marvel movie. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cheer, you'll be experiencing a roller coaster of a movie.","displayName":"Will B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T13:19:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T13:24:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"948111828","realm":"RT","displayName":"Will B","accountLink":"/user/id/948111828"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Well thought of, the ending set itself apart from other cliche hero movies.

Each and every movie has made me hungry for more! Infinity wars, was by far, one of the best movies I have ever seen! These movies are what I wish the comics could have been. These movies give more of a realistic view of the marvel universe heroes, than the comic books ever could. Infinity wars took me for a ride of emotion, to be honest.. I kinda need therapy after watching this, lol.. true to the comics themselves with some subtle changes I have seen through these 10 years.. Infinity wars brought over 10 years of marvel movies into this one major movie, it was like watching a symphony! The flow of 10 years of story into what was to become the Infinity wars...ugh.. it was just magical. I wish my father was alive to see this. To those critics that tried to pick apart this movie.. I say to you  if you truly are not interested in the comics.. then you have missed the reason why this movie and the others before it were so phenomenal. To see a little girl like myself, watch her favorite comics come to life in such spectacular splendor.. it has been a dream come true! Though I hate the wait for part 2, I know what's in store and I eagerly wait for the second half of this movie!! Excellent job to all that are part of the creation of the marvel universe and Thank you for bringing these amazing comics and story lines to life!","displayName":"Tara M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T13:13:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T13:29:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"919829745","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tara M","accountLink":"/user/id/919829745"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"All over movie is good. better than AOU. but the problem remains same. they keep cracking jokes which makes . I liked only one character doctor strange. he was only serious about everything. banner trying to make hulk out and hulk dont wanted to, that part in starting and in end were so stupid. no good music, no avengers theme, no any sequence \nthere is no any fight I see from captaion and black panther, just a few punches.\neven end was not that good. I thought this movie will be better than first one but now I know first one will always stay best from all.\n\nTony didn't stay in earth and I didn't like it.\naction scene were good but not compared to what we saw in civil war.\nThis is very big movie, there must be some scenes and actions which supposed to be unforgattable. You will also feel at least one time that this isn't movie about avengers or saving earth/universe. its about thanos and gamora story. good time wasted there.\nA lot of humor and jokes are there and they ruined emotional scenes. why it has to be this way?\n\nI hope next part will be better than this.\nit has its flaws and big disappointments, but still its watchable movie and forgettable movie too.","displayName":"Crazy C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T13:13:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T13:16:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"977252768","realm":"RT","displayName":"Crazy C","accountLink":"/user/id/977252768"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great action.

More cosmic and epic than Star Wars and LOTR, with a villain who is greater and more satisfying than Darth Vader, Sauron and Voldemort, this movie is good beyond all hope.  Yes character development is lacking in many cases, but there have been 18 prior movies in which we became familiar and fully vested with the cast.  The best of the Marvel films, and one of the five best I have ever seen.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10216401449765640/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T12:52:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T13:07:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"977252747","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977252747"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"the best super hero movie , and better than the last jedi , because mavel listen to the fans","displayName":"Lucas L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T12:46:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-12T12:23:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"977076518","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lucas L","accountLink":"/user/id/977076518"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great Movie , Has Action Humour and lots of Emotion .\nCan guarantee that it would break records .. \nMust Watch !","displayName":"Sarvesh A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T12:35:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T12:37:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"977252727","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sarvesh A","accountLink":"/user/id/977252727"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"}]}
