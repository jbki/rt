There were many small battles involving a few heroes each time.  The character Thanos was greatly expanded.\n    The second part of this movie was almost boring.   Just like the other two Avengers movies, the climactic battle  relies on countless hordes of generic enemies attacking the heroes.  And just like the other two movies, the generic hordes all die when a hero flips a switch (this time it's Thor). This is lazy script writing and I'm tired of it.  I'm hoping the second part of Infinty War does not use this lazy plot device.\n    The ending of this movie leaves much to be desired.  I understand the second movie will be happier. This reminds me of the disaster known as The Last Jedi.","displayName":"Dredd F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100005501701076/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T15:37:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T16:01:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"960913115","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dredd F","accountLink":"/user/id/960913115"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I #literallycantevenwiththisfranchise.
