I knew this film had to happen, but HOW in the WORLD would Marvel pull off a movie that will feature pretty much every hero in the over the last 10 years? Some how, they did it. It was funny, soundtrack was epic, HEAVY emotions, and HEEAAVVYY action. MAGNIFICENT, to say the least. A better term for the film, would be \"magnificently heartbreaking\". \n\nAll the heroes have their epic moments that make you scream out of excitement and awe, but Thor is on another level. Tony isn't far behind. Just...incredible. All the characters are incredible from Rocket to Scarlet to Cap. Black Order? Insane. Which brings me to the big baddie. \n\nThanos is unlike any villain to ever be featured in the MCU, and probably any other superhero movie. Scratch that. ANY. OTHER. MOVIE. EVER. The argument could definitely be made that this film should be totally renamed: Thanos: Infinity War. This was HIS film. Main character and all. It wasn't the clich√© villain with the \"evil plan\". This guy was absolutely horrifying. Unbelieveable power, even without the stones. But this dude was emotional. He truly believed he was saving the universe by taking away half of it. And with doing that, he had to make sacrifices (watch the film) he didnt want to make. It's beautifully portrayed, and shows that Thanos is so much more than your typical evil villain. He has a heart. That one scene just...tugs at your heart strings. But you HAVE to see it to understand. He's perfectly balanced, like all villains should be. (Get it?)\n\nThe ending was mind boggling. So many emotions that I couldn't feel a thing. My face felt expressionless. I heard literal whimpers coming from the crowd. It was almost too much to bare to be honest!! Just watch the damn film, but bring your big boy/girl pants. You'll be on the edge of your seat the entire time with your heart beating out of your chest, literally.","displayName":"Julian J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T10:27:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T10:29:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"931980072","realm":"RT","displayName":"Julian J","accountLink":"/user/id/931980072"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The Definition of Epicness : Unique and Unbeatable MARVEL.","displayName":"Mario T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T10:27:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T17:14:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"953785286","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mario T","accountLink":"/user/id/953785286"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The most epic MCU film so far! One of the greatest experience at the cinema, I never felt like I didn't like a scene or was bored about something, I wanted it to keep going for at least another hour, that's how good this movie was. The fight scenes were incredible, CGI top notch, almost every character was treated well with enough screen time and Thanos is just the best villain, the biggest, the baddest and most powerful one. He got more screen time, this was his movie but I really loved 4 characters from the Avengers that got more to do than others and were awesome but I can't tell because is kind of a spoiler.\n5/5 stars","displayName":"Ryan%20 J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T10:25:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T10:33:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"977242820","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan%20 J","accountLink":"/user/id/977242820"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One Of The Best Marvel Movies So Far..
