Unfortunaly, i spoted a plot hole so massive a fleet of death stars could fly through. It kinda makes all of end game, and everyones deaths completly meaningless. 1st Gamora tried to kill Thanos with a knife in the begaining. Thanos is mortal so this would have worked, if not for the reality stone. The plot hole comes in around 1 hour 50 minutes in. Durring the fight with Thanos, Iron man, and the others had him completly immobile, both physicaly, and mentally, completly unable to use any of the stones. Instead of failing to pull the guantlet off, a simple knife to the neck would have ended Thanos. I guess the writters were more worried about star lords relixation that Gamora was dead, than staying consistant. Somehow the smatest man alive, the sorrcerer supreme, the others, the writers, and the enitre adduiance were unable to figgure out, what took me 3 seconds. Thats not funny. I expect more from humans. Its emmbarasing, your stupidity is making me look bad. Please do better with phase 4, this is just bad writting. It looked cool though, so ill still watch end game. Its good to know that someone that workd for marvel is doing their job, because the writers arent. I could do better in my sleep.","displayName":"James M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1712314295568531/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-02T20:01:17.444Z","updateDate":"2019-10-02T20:01:17.444Z","user":{"userId":"978230635","realm":"RT","displayName":"James M","accountLink":"/user/id/978230635"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The first of a 2-part conclusion, and without a doubt, the best of all 22 movies.
