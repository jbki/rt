Good moments but I thought it was too long and boring. Cool concept, but there were too many mediocre story lines. If you like stuff because of the brand attached, you will love it.

Infinity War is the culmination of all the Marvel Cinematic Universe put althogether. Gather all of the heroes (sans Netflix and ABC characters) to prepare the inevitable; the coming of Thanos. I find that some of the scenes maybe stretched longer than usual or it just didn't fit. All of the characters have shared screen time. Here's a spoiler for you, there's deaths; surprise! \nInfinity War gave a great finish to the characters that we learn to love, what's good about it is that it can bring more characters to be introduced. This movie did not leave you happy but in a way, 'Wow' (jaw dropped). Overall its not to miss movie and its a great way to start the Summer 2018 blockbuster. Truly reccommend it to all of my friends and family.","displayName":"Reggie D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1045747071/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-26T07:32:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-26T07:47:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"821509488","realm":"RT","displayName":"Reggie D","accountLink":"/user/id/821509488"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The accumulation of 18 films over 10 years does not disappoint in this part 1 of the epic conclusion. Although the shear amount of characters involved in this film made the viewer want more screen time for each individual, the Russo brothers did a good job of distributing that screen time between the different groups of heroes. Even those prepared for a cliff hanger ending were not ready for the final act and fans can‚Äôt wait to see the finals next year. üëçüëç","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-26T06:39:42.668Z","updateDate":"2018-05-26T06:39:42.668Z","user":{"userId":"260138338","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260138338"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Would recommend.
