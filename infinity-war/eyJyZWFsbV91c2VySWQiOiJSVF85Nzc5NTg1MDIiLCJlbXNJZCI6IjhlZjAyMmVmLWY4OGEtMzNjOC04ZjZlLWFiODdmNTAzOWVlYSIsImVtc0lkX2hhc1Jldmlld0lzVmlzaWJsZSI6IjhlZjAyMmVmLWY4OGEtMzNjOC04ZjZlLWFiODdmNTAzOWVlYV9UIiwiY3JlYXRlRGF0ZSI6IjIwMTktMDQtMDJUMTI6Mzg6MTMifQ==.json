Giving us both satisfaction and disgust at the same time. The visual effects are amazing that easily bring out the light on its over-blown budget. The action that is on display was enticing and epic. Plus, Josh Brolin absolutely nails it as Thanos. Creating the most intimidating and complex villain this cinematic universe has ever seen. However, this movie is way too overstuffed. There's too many characters to keep track of, and all of the different plot points don't really flow well together. Also the ending at the end was the absolute worst. Killing off many characters without setting up the final chapter is just mean and filled with greedy ambition. A lame way to force everyone to watch Endgame, as you kind of know how its going to end. It does deserve positive credit, but not a lot of love and critical acclaim.","displayName":"Tyler S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-02T08:46:25.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-02T08:46:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"977875715","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tyler S","accountLink":"/user/id/977875715"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best mcu films along with winter soldier and civil war","displayName":"Shreyas A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-02T03:03:03.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-02T03:03:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"977957888","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shreyas A","accountLink":"/user/id/977957888"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"With a good story, strong performances from it's well chosen cast.

Excellent performances by the whole cast and the film does a good job balancing the spotlight across so many stars. Really enjoyed the Thanos backstory and the story being focused on the quest of his character leading to a non Hollywood ending. The challenge with films like this is the emotional connection can spread thin. On that front I think the action sequences help but would have preferred a bit more favor to strong dialogue over pure action especially for second or third viewings of what is a solid film. The only other thing is I am not a fan of are two or three part films made for the sake of purely milking the masses. I am not yet convinced that this story and the conclusion could not have been told better as a single film especially given the length of just one of them. I would gladly pay more as it would be a better overall experience.","displayName":"Steve S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-31T05:22:43.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-31T05:35:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"928542908","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steve S","accountLink":"/user/id/928542908"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 31, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A blast from start to finish, I really enjoyed Infinity War because it manages to mix so many iconic characters together and still not feel overcrowded.","displayName":"John K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-31T05:18:36.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-31T05:19:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"977954060","realm":"RT","displayName":"John K","accountLink":"/user/id/977954060"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 31, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It was okay but pretty sad at the end","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-30T22:57:20.426Z","updateDate":"2019-03-31T17:33:16.718Z","user":{"userId":"260139221","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260139221"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Dark, but has to be...  and not without plot holes, and far from the perfection of some of the earlier movies like Iron man, and Avengers part I.

All the heroes and heroines the creators have developed all defeated by an evil demon god, who looks invincible.
