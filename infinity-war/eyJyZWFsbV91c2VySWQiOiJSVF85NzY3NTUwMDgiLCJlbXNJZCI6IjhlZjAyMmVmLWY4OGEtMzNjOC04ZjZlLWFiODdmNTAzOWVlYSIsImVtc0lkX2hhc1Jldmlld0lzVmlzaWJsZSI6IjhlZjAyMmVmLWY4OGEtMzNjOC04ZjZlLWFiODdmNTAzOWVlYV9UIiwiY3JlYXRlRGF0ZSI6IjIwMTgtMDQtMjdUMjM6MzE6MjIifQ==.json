From the very first scene, the stakes are set which adds tension to every part of the film. The pairing of characters is perfect and every storyline seems important. One of the worries I had was that the characters wouldn't match up well but luckily this isn't the case. The Guardians of the Galaxy fit in perfectly with the rest of the cast. The CG is some of the best I've ever scene and makes this universe feel alive and filled with history. There are plenty of surprises for us who've followed these movies since 2008. While there's some fan service, it doesn't overtake the film but adds to it. This is everything I hoped for and I can't believe it lived up to the ten years of hype.","displayName":"Isaiah L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T23:17:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T23:32:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"921194303","realm":"RT","displayName":"Isaiah L","accountLink":"/user/id/921194303"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"10 years of films and 6 years of Thanos being hyped up.
