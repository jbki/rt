And at the same time, it surprises you, it shocks you, and it creates a compelling and threatening villain in Thanos. It manages to balance not only an insane number of characters but a myriad of tones, giving us the fun of Marvel, while also being the darkest movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nAvengers: Infinity War is truly Marvel's Lord of the Rings. It makes me wish that there were 3 parts to the saga... who knows, maybe they can split Avengers 4 into 2 films. \nAmazing movie.","displayName":"David T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/527612476/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T15:15:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T15:30:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"785088157","realm":"RT","displayName":"David T","accountLink":"/user/id/785088157"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"was never bored for one minute watching this movie ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T15:14:41.155Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T15:14:41.155Z","user":{"userId":"260004282","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260004282"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"You can't judge this movie on its own.
