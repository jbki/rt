The way the characters and their stories came together was so well written, the action is wonderfully shot, and Thanos is a complete and complex villain. There was one sequence that had some strange editing, (maybe they didn't get all of the coverage that they needed?), but I think if you've been a fan and you've been emotionally invested in all of these characters and their stories, this movie will probably rock your world. For people who aren't as attached, the movie can still be enjoyed- the person I saw the movie with has only seen a few of the MCU movies and still liked the movie, it just didn't have the same emotional impact on him.","displayName":"Jennifer R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T11:32:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T11:38:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243066","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jennifer R","accountLink":"/user/id/977243066"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T11:31:55.549Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T11:31:55.549Z","user":{"userId":"791954887","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/791954887"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"amazing perfect needs to be praised","displayName":"devin h","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T11:30:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T11:31:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243065","realm":"RT","displayName":"devin h","accountLink":"/user/id/977243065"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Would watch again, would recommend, destiny still arrives","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/969585616537454/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T11:29:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T11:30:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243061","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977243061"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"}]}
