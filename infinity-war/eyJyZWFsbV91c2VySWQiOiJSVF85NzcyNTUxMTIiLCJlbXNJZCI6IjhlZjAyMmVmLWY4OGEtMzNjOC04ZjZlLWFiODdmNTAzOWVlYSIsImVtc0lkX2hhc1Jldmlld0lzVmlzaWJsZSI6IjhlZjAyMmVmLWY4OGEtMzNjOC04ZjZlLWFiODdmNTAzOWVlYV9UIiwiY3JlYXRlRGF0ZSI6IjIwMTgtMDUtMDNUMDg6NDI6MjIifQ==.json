Extremely well done. The Russo Brothers are the best directors in comic book movies today. It's an amazing ride from start to finish. Well paced, full of action, well acted, it's a powerful story with an emotional impact.

Nothing ever felt like they could lose. For the first time I watched a movie and was actually thinking,\"holy crap! Who is going to die next?!\" Outstanding suspense, and a villain who actually has depth (even if it is a mad dream) I have to go watch it again!","displayName":"Michael R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T08:15:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T08:18:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"973038472","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael R","accountLink":"/user/id/973038472"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!!!! They pushed the limits this time and put us through every emotion known to man. The laughs were wonderful the sad parts still powerful once you remember they are operating in the same MCU you realize you pain will be temporary. However Thanos requests silence so I won't say. Kevin Feige is an amazing guy for pulling this off. The entire 10 years and counting hit after hit and it's become and obsession for me and the world. Please keep doing what your doing Marvel. In this new era of TV dominance and the real threat of movie theaters Marvel has moved us to the \"we need to be first to see it\" phase. I love looking forward to the characters and writing I love so much. Keep them coming Marvel. Y'all are so good your putting on a clinic. Pay attention to the Marvel formula world. Go back to making good movies.

I loved the first Avengers movie and was okay with Age of Ultron but this was a home run. Now that the majority of the characters have origin movies, it is like watching a group of friends work together. The dialogue was rapid fire and on point. I am a huge devil's advocate type of person so I see Thanos, the villain, almost as a tortured hero, sacrificing all for what he deems to be the greater good. I know that a loto of people were mad at how it ended but come on people, we knew going in there was to be a part 2 so that had to leave off somewhere. \nI highly recommend this film. It can be a date movie, solo viewing or group outing. Well worth the money and I am ready for the next installment.","displayName":"Roz W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1617079496/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T07:49:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T07:50:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"846537551","realm":"RT","displayName":"Roz W","accountLink":"/user/id/846537551"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Outstanding.
