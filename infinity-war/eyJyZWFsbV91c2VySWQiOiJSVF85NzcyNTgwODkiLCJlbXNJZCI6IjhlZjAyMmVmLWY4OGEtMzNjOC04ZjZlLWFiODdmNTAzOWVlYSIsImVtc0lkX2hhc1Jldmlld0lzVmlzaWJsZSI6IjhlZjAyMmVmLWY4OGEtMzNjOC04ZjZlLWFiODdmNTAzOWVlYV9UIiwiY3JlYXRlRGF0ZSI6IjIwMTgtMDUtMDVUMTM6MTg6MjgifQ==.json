Seeing all these characters I've been watching for 10 years come together; made me feel excited over and over again. No one character gets a tremendous amount of screen time. Marvel tried hard to split it all up evenly. Because of this, the only area it suffers is that it cuts around a lot and feels rushed, (which is essential to tell its story and showcase all of its characters). Without getting into spoilers, the movie is funny, emotional, nostalgic yet fresh, and a whole lot of fun because of the unique team-ups. I felt giddy quite often throughout the movie. I am super excited to watch the conclusion of this story in the future!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T12:44:05.761Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T12:46:26.419Z","user":{"userId":"908058862","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/908058862"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Avengers Infinity War has too many prerequisite movies for the viewers to understand and comprehend all the Avengers that show up, and all in all is just another Disney propaganda machine aimed to glamorize war, glorify technology and gun rights, military spending and tries mesmerizing the audience with colors as though they still have infantile minds using the 6 rainbow colors as the Infinity Stones so that the audience is lulled into fearing a purple guy by having him possess all 6 colors of the rainbow.

The amount of talent between everyone on and off screen is incredible. The Russo brothers have done it yet again following up two of their other Marvel films (Winter Soldier and Civil War).
