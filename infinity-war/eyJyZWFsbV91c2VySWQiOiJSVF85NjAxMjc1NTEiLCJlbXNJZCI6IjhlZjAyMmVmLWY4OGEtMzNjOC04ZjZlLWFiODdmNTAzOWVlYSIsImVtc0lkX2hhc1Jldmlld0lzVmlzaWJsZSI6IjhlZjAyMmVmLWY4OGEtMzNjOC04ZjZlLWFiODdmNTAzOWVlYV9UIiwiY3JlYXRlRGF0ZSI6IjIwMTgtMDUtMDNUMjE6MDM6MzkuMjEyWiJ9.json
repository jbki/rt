But it also ends up being an onslaught of CGI and action.  I felt the movie did its best bringing nearly of the various MCU elements together, but  struggled a little with mixing the various tones and plot lines.  Thanos was an impressive villain, but his henchmen were a little underdeveloped and never named or really introduced as far as I could catch.  The soundtrack was woefully unspectacular for such a high budget film.  Without a conclusion to this film, my 4 star rating is really based on the spectacle that was in this first half.","displayName":"Nicholas F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T20:59:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T22:17:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977185867","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nicholas F","accountLink":"/user/id/977185867"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best comic book movie of all time.","displayName":"Lemuel P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001078188402/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T20:47:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T20:52:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"966142183","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lemuel P","accountLink":"/user/id/966142183"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"vale cada pinche peso, brutal !!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10156154807984304/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-03T20:37:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T20:38:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977255795","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977255795"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 03, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was an amazing accomplishment that they told so difficult a story so well: more than 15 important, fan beloved characters, each needing to be seen doing what they are known for prominently, 5 different narratives in geographically separate locations, and source material that is very esoteric and philosophical, very difficult for an action film.

A full 2/3 of this movie is an exposition dump. Multiple characters help the antagonist in his quest in order to save one life when they know that helping the antagonist in his quest will mean the deaths of trillions of others. The villain's goal makes more sense than in most superhero movies but still isn't exactly rational in that limited resources will inevitably be exhausted even if populations are culled. While the ending is better than expected for this genre it also sets up the inevitable sequel. Maybe that one won't spend so much time explaining itself.","displayName":"A.c.
