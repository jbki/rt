They managed to juggle a plethora of characters in a way that allowed each one thier own moment in the spotlight. They put enough time into Thanos to flesh out his motivations and depict him as a credible villain to the entire marvel universe. It was funny at times, sad at others, and definitely leaves you wanting more. I've never been more excited for what the future holds for the MCU.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1155814548/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T21:48:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T21:59:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241087","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977241087"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is just amazing.

Thanks defiantly worth the wait. Lots of avengers die. Well its the usual marvel movie joke serious joke serious ugh. But towards the end it picks up and gets lots of action sacrifice on both sides.  Pulls a black panther and makes u sympathetic of the villain but once again they change the main villain beginning and is under powered then he should be.
