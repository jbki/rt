The special effects were amazing, the wit and humor were packed in with the action double dose style!! There were plenty of twists and surprises, and all point to Infinity War part 2!! Do NOT pay any attention to those critics sipping their sour wine, and longing for the days of Shakespeare on stage, who snubbed it!! This movie was a Fun packed thrill ride!!!
