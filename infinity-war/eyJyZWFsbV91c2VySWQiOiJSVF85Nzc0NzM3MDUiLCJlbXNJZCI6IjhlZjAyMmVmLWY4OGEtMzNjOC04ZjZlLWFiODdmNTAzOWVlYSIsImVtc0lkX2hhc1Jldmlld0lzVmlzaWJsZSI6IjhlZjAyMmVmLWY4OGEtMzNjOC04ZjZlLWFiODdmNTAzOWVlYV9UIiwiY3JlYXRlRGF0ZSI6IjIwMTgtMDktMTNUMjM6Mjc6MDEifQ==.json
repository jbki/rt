Over 10 years of storytelling and it's finally here. Avengers: Infinity War was a great movie. the effects were for the most part amazing. Thanos looks great. At times Iron Man's armor did look a bit fake but that's nitpicking. Overall it was a great movie and it was definitely worth the wait. The Russo Brothers did a great job.","displayName":"Ben B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-13T15:40:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-13T15:45:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"977461483","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ben B","accountLink":"/user/id/977461483"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Marvel has upgraded its movies to a new level with this amazing movie! Although, the script does have some plot errors that could have cut down the movie immensely rather than splitting it into two seperate movies.

However is not acknowledged the traffic jam of egos that suffers to go somewhere and makes very little sense. There's almost no pacing in here.
