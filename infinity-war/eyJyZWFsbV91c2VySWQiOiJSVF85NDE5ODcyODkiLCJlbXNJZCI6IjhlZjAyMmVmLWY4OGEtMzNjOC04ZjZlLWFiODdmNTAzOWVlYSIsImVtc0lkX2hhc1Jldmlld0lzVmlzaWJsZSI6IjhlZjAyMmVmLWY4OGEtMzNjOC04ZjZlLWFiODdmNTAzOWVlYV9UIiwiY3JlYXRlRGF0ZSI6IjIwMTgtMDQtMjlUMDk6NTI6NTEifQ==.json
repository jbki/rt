It's a heist. The last arc is fantastic and the score is clearly one of the best I've seen in a superhero movie. The dialogues and the acting are both phenomenal, as are the cinematography and the CGI. There's a lot of heart and soul in this movie, and it's breaking records both worldwide and domestically because people can appreciate quality.","displayName":"Black S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T09:51:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T09:56:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248512","realm":"RT","displayName":"Black S","accountLink":"/user/id/977248512"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"ITS AWESOME and sad . . .\ntotally watch it if you haven't","displayName":"Julian M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T09:51:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T09:52:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248511","realm":"RT","displayName":"Julian M","accountLink":"/user/id/977248511"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"i agree with the audience score, the tomatometer score is not genuine enough, the movie was amazing, there were some plot issues which could have been improved,however, the main plot is awesome. The visual effects and cgi is absolutely stunning.Although, Thanos cgi is sometimes off and disturbing.In the end, its a movie which i would watch again and again, its spellbounding!!!!! 84% undermines the movie, it should have around 92%,in my opinion!!!!!","displayName":"shah a","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T09:50:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T09:55:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248508","realm":"RT","displayName":"shah a","accountLink":"/user/id/977248508"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best movie of marvel.

I expected it to be heavy on action, and dark; and it was. When the lighter moments came, they came almost too quickly to catch. Thano's backstory was welcome but I wish there'd been more response to young Gamora's question about the price he paid. Current CGI can do only so much to convey those feelings. Lots of questions remain, and I look forward to seeing how the heroes respond. Stark's not the only one wondering about Strange's last words.","displayName":"Connie H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T09:45:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T11:17:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"947277568","realm":"RT","displayName":"Connie H","accountLink":"/user/id/947277568"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This isn't just a good movie, it's a good film. The story is beautiful, the execution of story telling is flawless, and the pace of plot is perfect. My most favorite part of this story is the portrayal of Thanos as an anti-villain. Say what you will about the unwitting scoundrel reluctantly doing the right thing and saving the day. This character believes he is doing something necessary to save everyone even though it he knows it's unthinkable. You can see the struggle he goes through and the loses he endures to finish the job he believes he has to do.  He's a character you would love to hate but his motive are not self serving, so you just hate to love him. All of the Avengers unite to become an unstoppable force brought to bare against an immovable object, Thanos. Their portrayal is spot on and everyone was perfectly placed through out the story. There are no empty spaces in this movie, and it's pace is never slow. So you have keep hold of your popcorn and beverage, because this is movie is a wild ride. This is Marvel's best masterpiece yet.","displayName":"Vince G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T09:43:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T10:14:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"976971673","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vince G","accountLink":"/user/id/976971673"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved Avengers Infinity War!!!
