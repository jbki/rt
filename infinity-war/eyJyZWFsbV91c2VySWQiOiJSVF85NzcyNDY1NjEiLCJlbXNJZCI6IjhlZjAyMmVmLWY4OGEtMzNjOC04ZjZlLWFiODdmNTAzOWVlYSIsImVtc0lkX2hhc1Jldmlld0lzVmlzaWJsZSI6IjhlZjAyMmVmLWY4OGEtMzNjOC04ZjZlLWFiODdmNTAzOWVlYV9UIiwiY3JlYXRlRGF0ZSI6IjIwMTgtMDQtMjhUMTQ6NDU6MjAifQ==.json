Oh my God this movie was incredible the crap hits the fan in like the first 5 seconds and it doesn’t stop for 2 hours and 30 something minuets just non stop action this movie made me cry 3 times but I know everything will make sense and everything be ok next year for avengers 4. The ending of this movie will make you shook and your popcorn will be soggy form your tears. The Russo Brothers did a amazing job with this movie and all the actors as well can’t wait to see what plans the Russo Brothers have for 2019 in Avengers 4!!
