Many scenes are thrilling and the film balances all the different events going on. With so many characters, it sacrafices screen time more many of them but this seems to be more of Thanos' movie more so than the Avengers movie. Overall the plot twists and homage to the comics makes it a top MCU movie and celebrates what a journey it has been while reminding us there is still a bunch of story yet to be told.","displayName":"Grant B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T17:48:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T17:52:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243994","realm":"RT","displayName":"Grant B","accountLink":"/user/id/977243994"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was like a roller coaster--- It was suspenseful, thrilling and dramatic. Everything I thought they wouldn't do. I loved every Marvel movie except for Captain America: The first Avenger, and I thought this would be a mindless 3 hour slog of action, where the Villain's stupid and there's nothing to enjoy. I didn't even think anything truly game-changing would happen. Boy, was I wrong. It was a perfect film, Better than Black Panther and even better than Logan.Without ruining everything, all I can say is it is surprising. And it's a Game changer.","displayName":"james c","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T17:48:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T12:29:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243992","realm":"RT","displayName":"james c","accountLink":"/user/id/977243992"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"best MCU team up movie since Civil War!!!

There's a ton of stuff going on in Infinity War.  The biggest difficulty I had was that despite the movie's focus on the Infinity Stones, the story line seemed to lack focus.  Admittedly, there was a lot of ground the Russo brothers had to cover and, overall, they did so commendably.  I would imagine that some audience reactions and ratings may be due to the ending, which, in the sense of \"superhero movies\", doesn't really end \"superhero-like\".  But it's not meant to and is intentionally a cliffhanger for the Avengers 4 movie next year.  The highlights of this movie were Hemsworth, Pratt, Bautista, Holland, Bettany, and Olsen.  I've already seen it twice and intend at least two more viewings in the theater.  .","displayName":"Don F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T17:46:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T17:56:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"958075095","realm":"RT","displayName":"Don F","accountLink":"/user/id/958075095"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The best Marvel movie to date. \n\nAmazing action scenes. \nEvery character was well utilized. \nThanos was spectacular. \nThe darker tone was overall better for the movie. \n\nThe only reason this movie can't get a full 5 stars is because sometimes comedy scenes dragged out, even though they weren't funny. (Drax claiming to be invisible wasn't funny but it still took 2 minutes out of my life regardless.) \n\nThe movie became more and more focused as it went on.
