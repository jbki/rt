My son came with me and he really dslikes 3D. However, I have to admit this movie had the best 3D effects of any movie that I've seen. For the first time ever, my son was thrilled to finally see a decent 3D film. He is familiar with the comics and wondered how they could possibly complete the story line in a 2.5 hour movie. LITTLE SPOILER ALERT: It isn't completed in a single movie. There were a few questionable decisions made by some of the superheroes but this show was show amazing, who really cares? I'm frustrated that I now have to wait a WHOLE year to see the finality of what happens, given the end of the movie.","displayName":"Christine C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T17:25:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T17:34:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"977259779","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christine C","accountLink":"/user/id/977259779"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"After 10 years plus of building up, this was well worth every penny and every second in the theatre. I can't wait for Avengers 4 to see how they work in the reversal. Anyone who hates on this movie has clearly too much vested in antiquated comics or can't respect the difficulty of getting so many stories together. The story captivates you, connects you to the main characters Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and helps combine their struggle over the years into an end game. This is a film to watch and to enjoy.","displayName":"William R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T17:20:56.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T17:29:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"977259783","realm":"RT","displayName":"William R","accountLink":"/user/id/977259783"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece of story telling.
