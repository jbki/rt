This ends unresolved and if they just hit a giant reset button in endgame then all the crucial character development in this movie will be moot. \n\nBut for what it is worth, the Thanos vs Iron Man showdown is the accumulation of a decade of build up and it is worth it. Seeing all the new interactions are a lot of fun, but the it all comes down to the guy with whom we started this journey. RDJ is the foundation the Tony throwing down in futile struggle against the Mad Titan was spectacular.","displayName":"Jerod K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-08T22:11:29.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-08T22:19:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"977875030","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jerod K","accountLink":"/user/id/977875030"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie.

I was quite disenchanted with the latest Marvel movies, the last great movie had been GOTG and WS, and a discreet CW. The visual effects are incredible, the characters are perfectly introduced. At last after 3 movies alone appears Thor in its maximum splendor and not the unfortunate hogwash seen in Ragnarok.\n\nI did not generate the same effect as was Avengers 1, but even so I left ecstatic at the cinema wanting to see the continuation.","displayName":"Angel A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-08T21:48:51.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-08T21:48:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"977888066","realm":"RT","displayName":"Angel A","accountLink":"/user/id/977888066"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is the movie to end all comic book movies, the best thing in this movie is all of the characters interacting with each other and all of the beautiful and vibrant visuals. The twist within this movie were extremely heartbreaking but incredibly simple. The ending of the movie is something that should be remembered in cinematic history\nand I would say the most talked about twist since the Empire Strikes Back.\n    Thanos was my favorite character in the movie because he and his relationship with Gamora was really complex and gives much needed character development for gamora. Also Thanos has the Will to act on his promise and has proven himself to be the most formidable foe to go against the avengers. He is also really amazing to look at, the vfx department did an excellent job. My second favorite character was doctor strange because his magic is so breathtaking that it took me out of the movie and thought that he could actually defeat Thanos. I also really enjoyed Thor and Wanda because they are so overpowered and their powers are amazing to look at that it was just incredible to see. I was disappointed to witness that a lot of popular characters such as Cap Black Widow and Black Panther unfortunately get less screen time that the others.\n   My favorite action scene was the Wakanda battle because it reminded me of the battle from Rogue One (the best 3rd act battle of all time) where it was the Avengers on an open terrain showing off their powers and their teamwork, a lot of teamwork in this battle.\n  Overall one of the best movies made of 2018 and is a must see once in your lifetime and must be seen on the biggest screen as possible. 10/10","displayName":"Grady R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-08T21:48:04.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-08T22:02:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"977888208","realm":"RT","displayName":"Grady R","accountLink":"/user/id/977888208"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it, I hope the second part is as good.
