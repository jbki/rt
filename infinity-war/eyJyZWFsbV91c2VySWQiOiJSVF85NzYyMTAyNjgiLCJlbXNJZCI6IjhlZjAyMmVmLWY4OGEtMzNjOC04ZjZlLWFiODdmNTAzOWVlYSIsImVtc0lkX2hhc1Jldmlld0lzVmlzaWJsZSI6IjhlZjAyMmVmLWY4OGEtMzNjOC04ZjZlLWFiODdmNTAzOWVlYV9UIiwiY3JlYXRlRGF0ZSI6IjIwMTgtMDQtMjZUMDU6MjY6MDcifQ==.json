That’s literally the only word I can say about it. Beware: This movie will emotionally drain you in every way possible... but in a good way I think haha. Anyways go see the movie more than once right now. For real. THIS IS THAT MOVIE. LIKE THEY DID THAT. Not only were the fight scenes out of this world and unlike anything else, but they were just able to balance good storytelling and plot, with emotional scenes, humor unlike any other (marvel never disappoints. DC take notes sorry...), good characters, but being able to balance and flesh out all these characters is just... WOW. THIS MOVIE. I still can’t believe it.

The awaited payout for Marvel's 18 movie build up to this moment has been well worth the wait! This movie story has incredibly high stakes and Thanos will go down as the BEST comic book movie villain ever. RUN out and see it this weekend.
