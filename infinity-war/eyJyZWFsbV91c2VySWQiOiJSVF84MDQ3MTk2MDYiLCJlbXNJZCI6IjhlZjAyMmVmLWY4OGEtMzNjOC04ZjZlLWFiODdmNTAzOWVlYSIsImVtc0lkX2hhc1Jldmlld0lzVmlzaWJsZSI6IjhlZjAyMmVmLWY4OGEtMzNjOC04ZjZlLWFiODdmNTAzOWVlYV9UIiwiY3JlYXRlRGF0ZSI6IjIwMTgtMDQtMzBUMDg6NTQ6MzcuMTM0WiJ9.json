This film takes knowledge for granted. And, for good reason. You are completely ignorant to believe that walking into this film having only seen half of these films is enough to fully appreciate it. While I whole-hardheartedly believe that the action alone contradicts that, it is still hard for the nineteenth part of anything not to take some knowledge for granted. Having seen all of the MCU films, solely based on their characters and quality of story-telling (which had admittedly become repetitive until this film), I can say that for myself, this is without a doubt the best film in the universe, as it serves as a proper climax for a series, a new jumping off point, and a surprising, emotional film in its own right. It is a greatest hits of each character, sure, but it takes these events and emotions that we've grown to love over a decade and forces them in a position to either sacrifice them or die. And boy, do heads roll in ways that you didn't know you wanted to see. Bravo Marvel.","displayName":"Cooper W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002726122311/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T08:53:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T09:00:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"935462756","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cooper W","accountLink":"/user/id/935462756"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great action and funny... the CGI was not 100% but pretty good.

I went in slightly worried that it wouldn't feel natural but everything was effortlessly fluid. HOWEVER, my complaint is that he very beginning of the movie immediately pulled me out of the experience. I understand that it was picking up directly after Thor Ragnarok, but it didn't preface that, so I was immediately trying to figure out what was happening and why. By the time I put two and two together I was pulled out of the experience of the movie and it took half the movie for me to be drawn back in.","displayName":"Blake B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T08:47:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T08:53:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250779","realm":"RT","displayName":"Blake B","accountLink":"/user/id/977250779"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing, this is how it looks 10 years of hard work.","displayName":"Jonathan%20 V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T08:46:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-22T18:09:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241163","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonathan%20 V","accountLink":"/user/id/977241163"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great juggling act by the Russo's.
