It’s 2 1/2 hours of watching a dog chase his tail. It’s a—what they made a movie about this tv show feeling. This movie reminds you of how empty a superhero movie can be. Thanos is the best part of the movie NOT the Avengers, which results in a movie that is uninspiring and a let down if you’re looking to see the heroes win. Spoiler, they don’t. This movie isn’t an “avengers” movie it’s “The Thanos” movie.

First Hulk is so toned down that Thanos didn't even employ any of the stones to beat him!  He even knocked Hulk out!  Then Banner is forced into and kept in an iron man suit. Agrhhhh! \nThanos is so hyped that he shouldn't be beaten even in part 5. How come Dr Strange never used the time stone? Then Iron Man and Spiderman (humans) are able to breathe freely on Titan. \nAlso annoying, Vision is carried about like a baby, limp and powerless.

I am shook! I guess there's more to it than that. This is an amazing film, and I don't understand the hate that some people are putting. Josh Brolin is amazing as Thanos. The movie has a perfect balance of seriousness and comedy. The characters have perfect storylines throughout (except for a small few) and the ending will make you go \"Woah, that was awesome\" or \"I can't believe you've done this.\" 5/5 can't wait for Avengers 4.","displayName":"Max G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T12:55:00.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T13:09:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246341","realm":"RT","displayName":"Max G","accountLink":"/user/id/977246341"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Thanos is by FAR the best villain in ANY superhero flick!

In classic MCU fashion, they blend some of the best elements from classic comic book storylines (Thanos Quest, Infinity Gauntlet, and Infinity) with their own spin that creates a truly unique and entertaining movie. After my first viewing (first of many for sure) I walked away with Thanos now my favorite marvel villain, slightly edging out Erik Killmonger from black panther and of course Loki. Unlike a lot of \"Big Bads\", Stephen McFeely & Christopher Markus crafted Thanos's quest (see what I did there) with a purpose that, even though you do not agree with him, you understand him. He is the villain that is hero of his own story. From Thanos's perspective, he is the only one in the universe that has the stones (I did it again) to set things right. Josh Brolin's portrayal also delivered a depth that I was not anticipating. You could tell that his actions laid heavy on him and his love for his adopted daughter Gamora came through in their time together on screen. For me, this made him different than your typical, crazy bloodthirsty murderer or your power-hungry tyrant type villain making him much more interesting. I was expecting a lot from Thanos in this movie as they have been teasing him since 2012 and they most definitely delivered. From top to bottom this movie was very solid. The only flaws,, in my opinion, is the same thing that makes it so great. The abundance of characters and storylines that must be serviced. I feel while they were woven together very well, we still could have benefited from spending a bit more time with each of them. However, at two hours and twenty-nine minutes, there was not much more they could do. Another knock I suppose you could give it is that if you had not seen prior Marvel movies, then the plot and emotional weight of some scenes may be lost on you. For me, this movie did what other movies have not done and that is promise an epic adventure and delivers an epic adventure. So, if you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? Thanos demands your presence.","displayName":"Coy P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T12:53:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T12:58:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246337","realm":"RT","displayName":"Coy P","accountLink":"/user/id/977246337"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is a top ten movie, in terms of any movie. very well written and acting is phenomenal.
