Like the others, there is plenty of laughs to be had, but over the course of the run time, the laughing turns to panic as the drama has never been more real. Thanos is a fantastic villain, pulled off by very well done motion capture and a subtle performance by Josh Brolin. He carries the film, having more time on screen than any of the heroes, and that is a good thing. We have come to known these characters so well that we don't really need to know that much more about them, just that they are put to the biggest test they've ever known. Finally, Marvel solved their mediocre villain problem, with Black Panther and also in this. \nThe story does feel a tad messy at times and it feels as though many of the characters had very little to do at all. But those problems are forgivable because of how huge the film is overall. The fact that this was done well at all, with this many characters, films, and subplots all converging over 10 years, it's very impressive, and only the smart folks at Marvel could've done it this way.","displayName":"Garrett R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T16:24:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T16:31:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"967585049","realm":"RT","displayName":"Garrett R","accountLink":"/user/id/967585049"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A kaleidoscopic journey through the Marvel Universe and back, Infinity War is more than just the icing on the cake.","displayName":"Matthew D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T16:18:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T16:20:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"961454203","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew D","accountLink":"/user/id/961454203"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best mcu film by now","displayName":"Ramiro M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T15:25:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T15:26:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"977270203","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ramiro M","accountLink":"/user/id/977270203"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I want some evil super villain to wipe out all other super hero's so Hollywood does not feel compelled to release a super hero movie every other day.","displayName":"Steve G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-15T15:16:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T15:17:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"952833349","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steve G","accountLink":"/user/id/952833349"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 15, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"i love this installment in the Marvel franchise. wow.
