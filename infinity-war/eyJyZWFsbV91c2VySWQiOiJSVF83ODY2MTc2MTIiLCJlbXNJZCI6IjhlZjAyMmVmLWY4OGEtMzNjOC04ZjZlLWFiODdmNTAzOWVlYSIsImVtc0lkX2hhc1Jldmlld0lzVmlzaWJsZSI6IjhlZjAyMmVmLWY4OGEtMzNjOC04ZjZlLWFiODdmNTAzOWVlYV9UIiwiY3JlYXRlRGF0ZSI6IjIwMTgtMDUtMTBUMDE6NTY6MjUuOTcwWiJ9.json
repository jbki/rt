It makes you a fan of Marvel even if your not a nerd who followed the comics. This movie hits all the high notes and will not leave you going through the same predictable story. It is also ground breaking on the magnitude of how well the story flows through all past and current Marvel movies. Don’t take a person who saw it’s word. Go see this movie!
