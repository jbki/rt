I believe I am finally ready to talk about the culmination of 10 years of Marvel films that is Infinity War. But at the same time it is way too hard to discuss things in debt without going into spoiler territory. So I’ll stick to the basics. The story arch was fantastic, the matchups were hilarious, and the stakes and emotion felt real. This movie gave me so much more than I ever thought possible, and surprised me at almost every turn. If you haven’t been following this cinematic journey from the beginning, first of all I feel bad for you. But secondly while I do believe it is possible for you to watch this movie and still enjoy it for what it is. I cannot begin to explain to you the complexity of storylines and events that have led to this. All I can say is WOW, they really did it. It took me to a place I never thought it would go, and I can’t wait to see what’s next!
