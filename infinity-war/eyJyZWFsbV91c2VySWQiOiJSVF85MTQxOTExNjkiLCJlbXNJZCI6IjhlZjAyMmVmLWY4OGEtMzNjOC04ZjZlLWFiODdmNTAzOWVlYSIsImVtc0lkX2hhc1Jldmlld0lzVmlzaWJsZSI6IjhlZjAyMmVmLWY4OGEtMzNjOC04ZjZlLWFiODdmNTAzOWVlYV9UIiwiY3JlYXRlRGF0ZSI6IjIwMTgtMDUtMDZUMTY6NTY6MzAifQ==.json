I wondered how the Directors were going to give all the main characters screen time, though I think they pulled it off. Great character development, the film was also funny as well as completely entertaining with an ending that leaves you wanting more. Thanos is the best villain I've seen in a movie yet armed with a realistic agenda for his mayhem.","displayName":"Danny N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T16:47:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T16:55:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"976966092","realm":"RT","displayName":"Danny N","accountLink":"/user/id/976966092"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was really good.

Some parts were exciting, some parts were tense, some parts were funny and some parts were heartbreaking. It was an action packed movie that hit the ground running and never stopped until the breathtaking ending. As a Marvel Cinematic Universe fan, I had no trouble following all of the characters and enjoyed seeing them all on screen playing their part. It was pointed out to me by lesser fans that they found the array of characters dizzying and overwhelming. I still think that this movie was a lot of fun and I highly recommend it!","displayName":"Mandy O","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/724777390/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T16:42:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T16:52:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"958837035","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mandy O","accountLink":"/user/id/958837035"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love this movie it's surprise mas and make me sad becand use all the heroes lose and died well half of them into dust I glad the fourth one coming out next year so I can wait to see the better ending.","displayName":"Bra'Lyn W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/313177975712142/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T16:39:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T16:42:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"975514682","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bra'Lyn W","accountLink":"/user/id/975514682"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was really good worth watching the movie.
