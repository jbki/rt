All the interactions with the characters were great and entertaining, the visual effects are surprisingly really amazing, the action was fun, the story was surprisingly very well done, and you never feel bored at all because of how engaging it is and how fascinating the movie and villain is. It’s such an ambitious piece of filmmaking, it took risks, it was darker than most Marvel movies, it looked fantastic, the Russo brothers bring a really interesting and fascinating style to this movie,its really surprising, and the movie has a really strong ending. This is probably the one of the best movies of the year so far.
