First, I'll start out with the tone. This movie is dark. Marvel is sometimes criticized for being to light and happy, and I thought this was the opposite of that. Infinity War gives you a sense of hopelessness, sadness, and anger. It honestly felt like my soul was crushed, and every time I think about the movie the feeling stays the same. Just because the movie made me feel these things, it was still great. I think that is one of the reasons you know a movie is good is that it gets you to feel these emotions about fictional characters. If you're scared of it being too dark, don't worry, there is some balanced humor throughout the movie, which for the most part I was fine with. \n\nI thought everyone's screen time was balanced pretty well if they were a main character (Tony, Dr. Strange, Thor, etc), but if your favorite character is minor (Bucky, Okoye, Shuri, etc) don't be expecting a whole lot of screentime. However, I do wish Steve got more time. The Russo Brothers said Thanos and Thor would have a lot of screen time, and I agree with them on that. The movie shows Thanos in an interesting light which really makes you think about what he's doing. I loved Thanos as a villain. What he is doing is horrible, but the amount of emotion he shows really makes you feel for him. \n\nEveryone's acting is incredible. A special shout out to Tom Holland and Elizabeth Olsen because they did an EXCELLENT job of portraying their characters feelings, which indeed made me cry. The cinematography is amazing as well. Later when I post a spoiler review I'll talk about some of my favorite shots, but for right now I'll just say when I saw one of the planets, the way it was portrayed was beautiful. \n\nI love movie soundtracks. I listen to them sometimes in my free time, which makes me sound like a huge dork, which I am. My favorite soundtrack is Civil War, and Infinity War is up there too. The music is awesome when characters are introduced, and it also is downright depressing at times. \n\nMy favorite part right now is the ending. I am going to see the movie again to think about it more, but right now I do have one scene in my head that is my personal favorite. I'm sure if you've seen the movie you probably can guess it. The way the characters relationship was showed and how scared him/her was, it just broke my heart. \n\nAs if the movie couldn't get any more depressing, the credits were dark and desolate. The music was solemn. But as always, STAY TO THE VERY END. Maybe that'll lift your spirits a little :) \n\nThank you to everyone at @MarvelStudios and @TheRussoBrothers . Why do you have to make me wait a year!!! I don't know how I'm going to make it. I'm going to try to see the movie again this weekend.","displayName":"Campbell S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1638991369717399/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T18:48:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T12:51:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"972021318","realm":"RT","displayName":"Campbell S","accountLink":"/user/id/972021318"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Es maravillosa de principio a fin.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1357821297652359/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T18:45:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T18:46:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"977244119","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977244119"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Current Moviegoer glowing reviews are likely from children seeing this movie in its first day.
