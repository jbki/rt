The movie immediately shows just how high the stakes are in the first 5 min of the movie, trully honing in the danger of Thanos. The fights scene with him and his cronies are amazing and the action is at a near constant. I honestly didn't realize how fast the time ha gone until the credits started to roll. I myself didn't cry, must most if not all my friends left the movie either with red eyes or balling their eyes out. My only thing is that the ending leaves the MCU in a little bit of pickle, which lowers the stakes for the next movie by a bit.","displayName":"Arnaud D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1665384910447231/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T06:41:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T06:46:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"975117642","realm":"RT","displayName":"Arnaud D","accountLink":"/user/id/975117642"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Russo Brothers just took the throne from Christoper Nolan...","displayName":"Ozan Ç","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/756766977/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T06:41:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T06:41:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"792509565","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ozan Ç","accountLink":"/user/id/792509565"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"An iconic culmination of the last ten years of films, the humour manages to not detract from the serious tone of the film. A more plot than character driven film but it doesnt suffer for it. The plot jumps around but stays focused and has a coherent narrative that dedicated fans and new comers will both enjoy.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2039282849617101/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T06:40:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T06:43:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245472","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977245472"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Infinity War is one of the most unpredictable movies of the marvel cinematic universe (even when it has some predictable things) The movie is entertaining and funny, is an 149 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it. The performances of all the actors is really good, but I had to highlight the performance of Josh Brolin as the villain, Thanos. The character is terrifying and you can feel that something could go terrible wrong when he´s on screen, he is the character that, to me, is the most interesting in the movie, and thetas really good, because a movie like this without a great villain could not be a good movie, and Brolin brings something additional to the character with his performance, even when the character is made by CGI, the performance is still very powerful, is like Andy Serkis as Caesar in the new Planet of the Apes movies. The visual effects are, of course amazing and makes what the best visual effects do, make you believe that what is on screen is real. Now, I have to speak about the negative points of the movie. First, it is a lot, the story tat they´re telling here could have been not a bit of a mess (like it is the movie) if they were telling it as a 10 episode series or something like that, but a movie can´t do that, so the result that we have on screen is a lot, and sometimes you can forget what some characters were doing at the beginning of the movie because they appear in minute 10 and the appear again on minute 40. Of course, everything that´s going on is important, but that problem makes you feel a little disconnected with some characters. Speaking about the characters, there were some that were really useless in the movie, and they were only there because they were introduced before. Stay for the scene after the credits, it is amazing, not like the one in Spiderman homecoming. In the end, infinity war will please fans and it will make them even more anxious for the next avengers movie. Watch out at the end, maybe you'll cry.","displayName":"Dolf V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1788016438193130/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T06:35:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T07:15:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"976243981","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dolf V","accountLink":"/user/id/976243981"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This film starts very badly, this film is good the special effects are excellent, the end is disappointing, the film is too violent for children and is Marvel film that belongs to Disney, the Rating should be PG-13 because of the scene of violence.\nAs well as the end is disappointing.","displayName":"Maxim D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T06:35:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-18T06:30:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"977037878","realm":"RT","displayName":"Maxim D","accountLink":"/user/id/977037878"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"is an epic and very exciting movie, it is not one of those typical superhero movies where everything is fun, here you can see coml our favorite heroes suffer in different ways.\nThanos is definitely my favorite villain of the UCM, the way he fights, his expressions seem so real and his motivation really makes you be at his side at some point in the movie.\nThe film is undoubtedly the best of the UCM and its end is unique and leaves the audience in silence and impacted.\nI could even say it's the best superhero movie.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/556464311404183/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T06:35:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T06:41:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245460","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977245460"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It's no Winter Soldier, but it still delivers.","displayName":"Yero H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T06:34:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T06:36:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"935489689","realm":"RT","displayName":"Yero H","accountLink":"/user/id/935489689"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"OMG!
