From start to the questionable finish, the movie is fun, thrilling, and entrancing.  Great movie with a credible plot.  Each superhero have their screen moments and Thanos may be the best villain in the comic book industry history (aside from Heath Ledgers' Joker).  Loved this movie. The ending left me wanting more. Cannot wait for the next installment. Marvel keeps upping the ante.","displayName":"Vernon B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T20:57:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T17:28:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"976483054","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vernon B","accountLink":"/user/id/976483054"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Just got out of the premiere.

It was lacking that spark you usually get when you watch these movies but the Russos failed to deliver on that end. It focused too much on certain characters/groups and didn't let everyone have their say. To add to this the movie didn't leave you satisfied after it was over, it was more of a \"thats it?\" type of moment. The original idea of this being a part 1 and 2 would have been better. I love marvel movies but this just didn't do it for me.","displayName":"Kaitlin%20 c","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T20:52:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-26T20:53:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"977240961","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kaitlin%20 c","accountLink":"/user/id/977240961"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"}]}
