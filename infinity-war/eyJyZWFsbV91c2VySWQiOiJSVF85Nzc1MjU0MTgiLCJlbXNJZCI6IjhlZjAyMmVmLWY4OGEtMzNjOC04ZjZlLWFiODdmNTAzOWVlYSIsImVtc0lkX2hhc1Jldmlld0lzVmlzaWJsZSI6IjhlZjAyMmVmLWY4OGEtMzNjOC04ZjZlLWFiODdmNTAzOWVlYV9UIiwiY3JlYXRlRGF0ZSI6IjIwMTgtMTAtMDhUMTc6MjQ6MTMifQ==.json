This movie is what fans have been waiting 6 years for since the end of the first avengers and it does not disappoint. My only issue with the movie is some sub par CGI at times. But most of the times the CGI and other effects are amazing case in point Thanos. Make no mistake this is Thanos’s movie and Josh Brolin does a amazing job with the character. The rest of the cast also shine bright. This movie is more then a just a movie it is a pop culture event. 10/10","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-08T00:41:47.472Z","updateDate":"2019-02-21T17:06:40.493Z","user":{"userId":"260105782","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260105782"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I love the movie so much but part of the line its ughhh to much nerd but fine.... i love thanos so much he was great and scary and i get it he think he gonna fix the world and he does so great movie very nice","displayName":"???? ?","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/835958676564075/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-07T13:32:02.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-07T13:34:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"976503885","realm":"RT","displayName":"???? ?","accountLink":"/user/id/976503885"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great story telling and an epic way to bring together the entire MCU (with the exception of Ant Man and Hawkeye).
