It's just a silly film with only action. Many cringy dialogues and dumb moments ruined the film. I felt really bad when yondu died in GOTG 2 but in this film never felt anything for anyone. So many died but i don't know why this film was in a rush and that's why their death didn't made me feel bad for them. They should have increased the runtime of the film. One of the worst thing is characters were not balanced. Captain america hardly had any dialogue. Hulk was shown only for 30 seconds in the entire film. There were many ways to stop thanos but hey he should look badass so let's make heroes dumb. Cgi was okay but in many places it looked cartoon-ish. In one scene it looked like Mark ruffalo's face is pasted on hulk buster. The film is full of plot holes.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1872108236420799/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-10T04:46:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-10T04:47:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"977263371","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977263371"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's nice to see something refreshing and epic like this","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2075692869366343/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-10T03:50:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-10T03:51:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"977263333","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977263333"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The empire strikes back of the marvel/avengers universe.
