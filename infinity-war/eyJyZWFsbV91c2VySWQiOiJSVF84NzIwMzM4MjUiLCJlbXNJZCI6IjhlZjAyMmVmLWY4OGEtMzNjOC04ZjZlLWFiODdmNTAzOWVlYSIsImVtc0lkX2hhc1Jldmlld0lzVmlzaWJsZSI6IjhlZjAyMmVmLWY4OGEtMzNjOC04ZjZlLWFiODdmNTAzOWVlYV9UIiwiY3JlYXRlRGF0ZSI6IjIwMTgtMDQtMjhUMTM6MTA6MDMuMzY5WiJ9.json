The story centers around Thanos, played incredibly well by Josh Brolin, as he tries to collect all the Infinity Stones in order to wipe out half the universe. As he does this in different places, different Avengers try to stop him. And that's about it. They never really assemble. This is a good movie, but it doesn't feel like an Avengers movie. The action scenes are good, though not very fluid. The score is great and is clearly a standout. The characters all do a good job, and this film is very funny. Also the visuals are spectacular and some of the best out to film in most areas. And this film is relentless and devastating, and is very dark and grim which I appreciated. As for weaknesses, like I already stated this doesn't feel like an Avengers film and there isn't a standout action piece. Also, this is very much a Part 1 and leaves the audience wanting answers. In the end though, this film delivers a great villain and some  awesome interactions that come together to make a very solid MCU movie. Now please give me Infinity War Part 2.","displayName":"Justin B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T13:08:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-12T06:10:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"967577419","realm":"RT","displayName":"Justin B","accountLink":"/user/id/967577419"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing.
