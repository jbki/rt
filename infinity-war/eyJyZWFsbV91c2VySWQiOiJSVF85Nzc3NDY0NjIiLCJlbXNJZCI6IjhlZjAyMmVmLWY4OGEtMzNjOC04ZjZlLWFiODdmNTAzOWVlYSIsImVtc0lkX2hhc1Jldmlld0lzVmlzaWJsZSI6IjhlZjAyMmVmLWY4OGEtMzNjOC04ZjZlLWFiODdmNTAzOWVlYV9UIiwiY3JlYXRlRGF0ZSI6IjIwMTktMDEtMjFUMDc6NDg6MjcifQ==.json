The Russo brothers have done it again as for the second time in the MCU they manage to juggle so many characters and side plots yet make the plot of the movie understandable and fun for everyone.

Marvel have spent ten years building this exciting connected universe where our favorite heroes from the comics can come together and interact, and this movie is the peak of all that work. Every single scene in the movie draws you in and makes you want to watch more. On top of that, being able to see all of the heroes that we have grown to know and love adds an unbelievable level of excitement. In addition, the villain is incredibly dynamic and the most unique that the MCU has shown us so far. Moreover, there is still plenty of time left for Marvel to give the audience some comedic moments that allow some reprieve from the film's unanticipated and painful ending. Audiences could only sit in anguish as some of their favorite characters were instantly taken away to somewhere unknown. The two biggest questions left to ask after watching the film are: What will happen next? and How in the world can the Russo's improve this masterpiece of storytelling and blockbuster superhero action?","displayName":"Jeremiah  A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-19T18:02:39.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-19T18:09:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"977727444","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeremiah  A","accountLink":"/user/id/977727444"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"i prefer comic book films when its just 1 or 2 of them (unless its X-Men) but this was good, maybe even very good, we all know what part 2 will do but its all about who we see again, at times it went on a bit but still a great watch","displayName":"Danny G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-19T14:16:57.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-19T14:18:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"977742092","realm":"RT","displayName":"Danny G","accountLink":"/user/id/977742092"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I was honestly disappointed by Avengers: Infinity War. Overstuffed, overhyped, and overrated movie. I fell asleep during this movie. It was surprisingly very boring. Conversation scenes dragged on for far too long and the pacing was super horribly slow. The movie's tone lacked consistency. The movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a serious movie or a childish comedy. The jokes were stupid and annoying and derailed so many moments. Star-Lord was extremely annoying and childish. His dialogue was stupid, this movie made me hate him. I honestly wanted Star-Lord to die. The scenes with Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy were the worst and incredibly overlong and so boring that they put me to sleep. Peter Dinklage's performance was terrible and he was terribly miscast. Mark Ruffalo's acting was horrible. I always hated Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk and Bruce Banner. He never fit the role at all. Speaking of the Hulk, he was barely in this movie. The Hulk was only in one scene in the opening when he fought Thanos but lost. I literally sympathized with and rooted for Thanos to win than any of the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy.","displayName":"Kevin R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-19T13:23:59.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-19T14:22:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"976821301","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kevin R","accountLink":"/user/id/976821301"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Avengers: Infinity War able to keep all of it's all-star cast being in the same spotlight without sacrificing another, and tell a tense and thrilling story.","displayName":"Robin E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-19T01:23:00.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-19T01:24:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"977739211","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robin E","accountLink":"/user/id/977739211"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"kind of lacklustre. some characters are getting way little screen time but overall i think it's great and loved the ending.","displayName":"Menna E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-18T15:01:30.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-18T15:03:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"977739762","realm":"RT","displayName":"Menna E","accountLink":"/user/id/977739762"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Filled with action and an enormous cast, almost too much, at the expense of a solid storyline.
