The entire time, I was fully engrossed in the movie.  The movie is paced extremely well, and Marvel overcame the stupendous challenge of balancing a movie with so man characters.  There's not one character that I think was featured more than another (save maybe Thanos, considering he's the main villain).  Speaking of Thanos, I really can appreciate him as a villain and can completely understand and relate to his motives.  That's not to say that this movie doesn't have it's flaws, as all movies do, but my immediate impression is very positive.  To summarize, Avengers: Infinity War is a thrilling yet compelling, entertaining, yet thought-provoking film that has left me hungering for more from the ever-expanding wonder that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","displayName":"Lucas S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T11:57:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-22T14:26:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"977252681","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lucas S","accountLink":"/user/id/977252681"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Saw it last night, amazing movie worth going to sleep at 2am and losing my job.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100003695724804/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T11:54:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T11:55:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977252677","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977252677"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It`s as good as it should be.
