Features compelling storytelling, great character interaction, dazzling effects, powerful musical score by Alan Silvestri, amazing direction by the Russos, and of course, the brilliant acting (particularly Josh Brolin's Thanos, who makes for the best MCU villain). Overall, definitely one of the best superhero movies of all time and one of the finest comic book films ever made.","displayName":"Jason A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-09T10:35:02.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-09T10:37:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"977650586","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jason A","accountLink":"/user/id/977650586"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Greatest Movie Since BvS.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-09T03:56:56.088Z","updateDate":"2018-12-09T03:58:13.909Z","user":{"userId":"260012300","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260012300"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best bang for your dollar for a super heroes flick.

I enjoyed it beginning to end. Wow, what an ending too. Brilliant! I loved all the characters and the story. The action seemed non-stop. A lot of tough choices for the characters.\n\nIt's hard to find any flaws. Maybe more Hulk but I will wait to see Part 2. It must have been really tough for the Filmmakers to give screen time to all the characters and have the movie flow but they achieved it I think.\n\nThe CG was done to perfection. Nothing looked cheap or rushed like Justice League.","displayName":"Michael B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-03T12:40:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-03T12:44:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"977642685","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael B","accountLink":"/user/id/977642685"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2018"}]}
