It's fine that they want to give depth to the characters, but we're talking about one of Marvel's biggest villains.\nIf Thanos had come in plan, \"everything is mine aside bitches\", I think seeing the heroes falling one by one would have been better than the soap opera they tried to do in the background of the character.\nI can not deny that the fight sequences were good, but the movie left me a lot to be desired ... in a few words it was a movie that speaks of a very GENERIC CRISIS.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001260081771/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T10:51:15.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T10:59:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"977259351","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977259351"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie by far!!

On verra si la suite mérite autant, espérons qu'ils ne ruineront pas ce qui s'est passé dans le 1er, mais pour le moment, ce film est parfait.","displayName":"Dominique D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-06T10:40:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-06T10:43:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"192429413","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dominique D","accountLink":"/user/id/192429413"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie.
