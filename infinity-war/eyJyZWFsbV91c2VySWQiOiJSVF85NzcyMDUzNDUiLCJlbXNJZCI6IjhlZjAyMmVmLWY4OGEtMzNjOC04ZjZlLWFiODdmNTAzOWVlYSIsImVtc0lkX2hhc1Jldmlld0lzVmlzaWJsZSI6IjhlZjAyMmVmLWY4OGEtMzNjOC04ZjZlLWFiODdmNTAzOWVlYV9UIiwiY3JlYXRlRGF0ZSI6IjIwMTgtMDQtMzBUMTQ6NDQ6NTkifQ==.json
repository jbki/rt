The power of his will, was more powerful than any stone .. Thanos need of fulfilment was just the underlining for his success. This movie provided all types of emotions and their was maybe a lot of fluctuating going on in this film.. the story is about thanos, I had hope to explore more of his setup for exsistance but seems pretty standard for what came to pass. one flaw I did not enjoy.. was the secret of the soul stone location.. and how gamora came into knowledge of it.. was just over looked I wish they explored it in a movie.. but maybe well see it in captain marvel. the set up for the next film seems to be legit I cannot wait until we see what's in stored","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T14:32:43.889Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T14:32:43.889Z","user":{"userId":"976323670","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976323670"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wonderful!

For the most part great movies leading up to this. No. I left unimpressed. I have 7 reasons as to why this was a bad movie.\n1. Scarlet Witch/Vision\nThey were so genuinely bad in this movie it ruined it. Their love story almost became the plot. It was completely unnecessary. \n2. Hulk\nThey have ruined Hulk. He was a WHINEY LITTLE BITCH in this movie. He is supposed to be one of if not the most powerful Avenger. No he gets beat up once and he doesn't want to show himself.\n3. Dumb Characters\nThe characters were so dumbed down the couldn't even think of the most basic and logical way to go about this. They easily could have gone back in time to stop Thanos from being born or just shoot him in the face in the beginning. But no they had to be more stupid than Captain America Civil War.\n4. CGI\nThere is only one word to describe the CGI. AWFUL. I have never seen anything so horrible and visually unappealing.\n5. Iron Man\nHe pissed me off so much in this movie it's not funny. I have always hated Iron Man but he was a control freak a real control freak in this one. \n6. Misleading Title\nI will say in bluntly there was barely any time with the Avengers. It should  have been called Thanos and the Collection of the Infinity Stones with special appearances by the Avengers.\n7. The Humor\nThere was inly one good line fron this horrible movie and that was \"get lost Squidward\" the other stuff was not funny and very childish. It was so stupid.","displayName":"Robert L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T14:21:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T14:36:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"977198712","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert L","accountLink":"/user/id/977198712"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Near comic book perfection!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T14:20:40.649Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T14:20:40.649Z","user":{"userId":"260028404","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260028404"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wow, this was the perfect culmination of 10 years of movies. i have been a fan since the start, i have seen every marvel movie in theaters and i was blown away from start to finish. ps thor is the mvp..","displayName":"Ethan M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T14:12:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T14:12:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"914517057","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ethan M","accountLink":"/user/id/914517057"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"By far the best superhero film ever made.
