But my hat goes off to the directors, writers and the whole crew of Infinity War. I thought the editing was exceptional. With so many characters and storylines going on, and the need to weave a coherent story for the upcoming grand finale, the task of editing this movie was monumental. And the ability to make an otherwise standard good guys win movie into one with an unexpected twist! Well done gents (and ladies ).

Unlike the most overpraised blockbuster of 2017, the epically atrocious and IP destroying Last Jedi with Infinity War Disney once again proves it gets how to make Marvel movies. It is not a perfect film hence 4.5 ratings. I will try to keep this spoiler free, but in lieu of Good, Bad, Ugly this films deserves a Bad, Good and Great analysis. Bad: No real spoiler to say stakes are not as high as they may seem. Heroes can and do routinely resurrect. I felt the ending needed to do a better job assuring us there would no quick reboot. But that is a nitpick. Another nitpick is why Thanos allows the Avengers to mess with him so much when it establishes his almost supreme power early. It is hard to distinguish him between the Gods (Thor) and a person like Iron Man. But early on they did establish he likes to fight a bit for entertainment so that may be a valid excuse. Good: effects are great. No retread of Planets like Star Wars series. The story is solid. Thanos has a motivation, a legitimate and interesting motivation unlike other baddies (Kylo Ren looking at you kid). He is a philosopher as much as a villain which makes him a great villain. Great: Josh Brolin voice acts a very believable Thanos. Saldana is great as Gamora. Acting for spidey, Thor, Hulk, Iron Man and Starlord also “stellar.” Guardians of the Galaxy mix well with this series. Black Panther was a bit shortchanged for lines but the Battle for Wakanda was beautiful. Overall a great blockbuster. As a Star Wars fan, I want to hate this movie as revenge for Last Jedi but you have to be honest. The issue with Wars is not Marvel but it is a tale of two creative divisions within same company. One division spent years developing IP and building up to a great story, the other hired a TV writer/director to craft a soap opera for the third trilogy and then hired a hack amateur to crash the whole thing in the second part of trilogy. Wars is making it upas it goes along whereas Marvel is actually writing. Infinity War is the result.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T02:02:27.982Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T02:02:27.982Z","user":{"userId":"260008501","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260008501"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"What a great set up.
