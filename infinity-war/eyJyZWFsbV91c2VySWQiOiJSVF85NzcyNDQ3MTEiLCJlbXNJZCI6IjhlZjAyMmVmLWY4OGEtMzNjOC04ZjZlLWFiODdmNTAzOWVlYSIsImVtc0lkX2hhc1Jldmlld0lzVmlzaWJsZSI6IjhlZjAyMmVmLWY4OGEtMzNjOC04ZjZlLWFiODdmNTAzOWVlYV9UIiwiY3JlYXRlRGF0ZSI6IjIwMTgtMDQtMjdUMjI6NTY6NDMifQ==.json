Since WHEN is it acceptable to have the bad guy win? I get for a TV show ending on a cliff hanger is a good idea because you want people to keep watching but that's not how a movie is supposed to work! They set it up to have a sequel which I think is bull. And can we talk about Thanos (the bad guy)? Why did they make it so we would have compassion for him? That's ridiculous. He's evil. There should be no compassion. All in all this was a terrible movie and I'm not even interested in the marvel franchise. It's just a terrible plot and story line. Also, I'm sorry to all the people who were literally weeping. My heart goes out to you.","displayName":"Zoe J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T22:50:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T22:57:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977244690","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zoe J","accountLink":"/user/id/977244690"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Start strong right out of the gate, bogs down for a short time, then just assaults you with non-stop action, comedy, and powerful moments.","displayName":"Charlie G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T22:50:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T22:52:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"938400749","realm":"RT","displayName":"Charlie G","accountLink":"/user/id/938400749"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It is arguably the best MCU movie ever and the best movie I've ever seen in my life and the people who are giving the negative reviews or Die Hard DC fanboys and I would like to say them that after Infinity Wars it is just R.I.P DC","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1398847143575358/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T22:49:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T22:56:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"977083705","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977083705"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It’s the gut wrenching, pulse pounding epic we’ve expected for the last 10 years.
