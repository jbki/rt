It makes perfect use of all the great actors. The villain is threatening but interesting. It manages to balance so many things at the same time and still tell a great story. Truly the peak of the MCU and still not sure if ENDGAME will be able to beat it.","displayName":"Jemmy J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-09T00:15:35.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-09T00:15:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"977828574","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jemmy J","accountLink":"/user/id/977828574"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Better than the first Avengers film, though not quite as fun.  Finally pitted against a quality antagonist to fight the team.  Thanos is truly menacing with ample screen presence.  Hard to do with a CGI created character.  The rest of the cast brings it as well.  And even though we know the ending wont stick, its still pretty dramatic in its execution.","displayName":"Mitchell  W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-09T00:09:14.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-26T18:15:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"977885623","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mitchell  W","accountLink":"/user/id/977885623"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie.
