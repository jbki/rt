It is a cinematic event. Looking at it objectively, nothing like has every been done before. 19 different films, numerous different franchises all coming together for an event. As a huge Marvel fan, who has seen all of 19 films, this is the most satisfying experience I have ever had watching a movie. All the studying and homework of watching movies like Iron Man 2 or Thor the Dark World have paid off. Character interactions that happens in the movie are even funnier and more rewarding because of things that I have seen in the other films that the movie plays off of. As a Marvel fan, this is my favorite film in the MCU. Looking at it from the perspective of someone who has not seen all the different films, it can come off as a confusing and overwhelming but a fun action movie nonetheless.

If I could give this 0 stars I would. I don't get why everyone likes this. This movie has the same plot. It has no development of characters or story. I will say, the special effects are phenomenal as well as the cinematography, but nothing else was too good. However, this is just my opinion, so please don't take this to heart anyone.","displayName":"Cole C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-20T17:54:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-20T17:56:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"977145444","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cole C","accountLink":"/user/id/977145444"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Thanos cant save this from being a weaker marvel movie, not the worst but not in my top ten.","displayName":"Quinton k","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-20T15:26:34.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-20T15:26:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"977328011","realm":"RT","displayName":"Quinton k","accountLink":"/user/id/977328011"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie in the lineup of marvel movies, good entertainment.","displayName":"Bryan W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1127940297/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-20T12:52:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-20T12:52:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"866035513","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bryan W","accountLink":"/user/id/866035513"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Didn't wimp out on ending.","displayName":"Garth W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-20T12:02:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-20T12:02:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"942779384","realm":"RT","displayName":"Garth W","accountLink":"/user/id/942779384"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Avnegers: Infinity War is definitely what the Avengers franchise needed.  While Avengers: Age of Ultron brought dry humor, slow plot line, and underdeveloped characters, Infinity War is the opposite.  IW definitely seemed fast paced, but it needed to be.  It was long, but the pacing keeps the audience interested.  Characters are fleshed out, even if they previously were not in other films (Scarlet Witch, Mantis, etc.), and Brolin's performance as Thanos, the lead baddie, is mind-blowing.  The Russo Brothers successfully craft multiple worlds into one: the Avengers, Black Panther's Wakanda, and SPACE (Thor, Guardiands), all flawlessly stitched into one coherent universe.  It's action-packed, but emotional.  Of course, after countless movies, you SHOULD care for these characters, but you don't care any less when they're all thrown into one world.  If you haven't seen the previous movies, you might struggle with some minor characters (Wong, Thanos' lackeys, etc.), but the movie is exciting enough to keep anyone engaged.  If you have seen the other films, you'll love it, and if you're any sort of comic book fan, you'll talk about it for weeks.","displayName":"Mallory B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-20T10:16:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-20T10:25:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"977327666","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mallory B","accountLink":"/user/id/977327666"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie which will be remember for its cinematography, story line and special effects.
