We have almost 25 or more character and they had enough screen time to make the characters shine on their own way.\n\nThe characterization in this movie really relies on what the past Marvel movies has made except Thanos. Avengers Infinity War really feels like a Thanos movie than Avengers movie, and that is a good thing. What also made this movie a great movie is mosly Thanos, his motivations are clear and somewhat understandable. One must say that his motivation is almost poetic. While everyone is giving the praise for the writing, Josh Brolin performance as the big purple villain is something to be praised for.\n\nAvengers Infinity War is a movie that really understands  how to balance its characters and the tone of the film. Infinity War broke expectations and made bold choices.\n\nNEGATIVE\nThe phasing can be dragging at some points\nI don't like that Bruce Banner/Hulk subplot\nTeam Cap was underused\nCGI on Bruce in Hulkbuster is noticeable\nTeam Cap and Team Tony didn't meet\nThere's no Airport Batlle-esque sequence (the action sequences are still really good though)\n\nInfinity War is great movie. Real stakes. Good Villains. Powerful Ending, Great Characters.\nWhat more can we ask for. Marvel somewhat manages to make it work.","displayName":"Justine Adrian L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/305437906576748/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T19:54:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T20:31:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"976492430","realm":"RT","displayName":"Justine Adrian L","accountLink":"/user/id/976492430"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The fact that this only has 84% from critics just goes to show why critics are useless. This blows away every previous Marvel movie in my opinion and maybe only comparable to Thor 3 as the best Marvel movie in recent releases. The best villain from any Marvel movies thus far and great mix of emotion, comedy and action.
