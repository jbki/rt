Lucas Films you better learn a thing or two from Marvel. Even though There's Tons of character dies in this they made it so with purpose, reason and fully utilize them 100%. Can't wait to see Captain Marvel and Avengers 4 \n\nP.S Please do note take the TOP Critic Seriously, Most of them don't even know a good movie. Rating Starwars the last jedi around 90% and this 88% lol you know they're reviews are trash.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1789595331053224/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T09:59:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T10:07:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"976971287","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976971287"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Marvel so far.

Also am I the only one who is wondering about Korg, Meek, and Valkerie. Sure they're most likely dead but for what?! Plus what even was the point of Thor ragnarok? They destroyed his hammer(temporarily), took away his eye(temporarily), and got rid of his hair which is the only real change besides stormbreaker that happens to Thor. Loki, heimdal, and the people of Asgard yea but still, I honestly was surprised by everything that happened in this movie and was kind of disappointed that the people who wrote and created this movie lowered Thanos's power level because with or without the Infinity Stones he is considered to be one of the strongest in the universe but he gets beat and sliced and kicked like he's an ogre who can't feel pain. Sure he's still beyond powerful in the movie but not nearly as powerful as he should've been. I also liked how they properly adapt his motive for destroying half the universe from the comics to the movie. Sure it's not accurate but it is really impressive how they were able to do this. I give this movie a 9.5/10. But it seems more accurate for Thanos to give it a 5/10.","displayName":"Charles K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T09:53:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T09:54:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"977248515","realm":"RT","displayName":"Charles K","accountLink":"/user/id/977248515"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The ending fell flat and felt derivative because all the characters who disappear have future movies on the schedule.  Thus, we know that those characters are coming back and that Thanos did not succeed. There is no doubt. Because you are unconvinced the characters died, you are aware that either (1) Dr. Strange put a time loop spell on the time stone or (2) Thanos, overcome with Grief, will return to the time before he killed Gamora or a variety of other possibilities that involve Strange tampering with the stones. \n\nThere is also a shot from the trailers that is clearly from the next movie or that was clearly cut from the ending of this movie that must occur after Thanos' Snap of Death. It shows Bruce as the Hulk in Wakanda sprinting together with Bucky and Black Panther and Black Widow. Well, if Bruce is the Hulk, that happens after Thanos' snapped his fingers. And therefore, this image is from after Thanos snapped his fingers. Which means there is an entire scene where we find out how these characters came back, which was edited out of the final cut. We find out post credits that it was edited out for no other reason but to promote Captain Marvel.","displayName":"Adam D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T09:52:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T10:06:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"941987289","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adam D","accountLink":"/user/id/941987289"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"}]}
