Full of great action, amazing special effects, wonderful characters, and just an all out blast.

It was slow in a lot of points and the action was good when it was happening. The worst part about it is that’s it’s a part 1 in the worst sense: “to be continued...” like a TV show except next week is next year. Honestly, if it hadn’t been for Thor and Spidey, it would have been even worse. It wasn’t as good as AV1, Guardians 1, Ragnarok or Black Panther. It’s somewhere in the middle.

The cast is superb, as usual, with each actor playing their characters at their usual best.  The standout is Josh Brolin as Thanos, who combined with some brilliant performance capture, crafts the MCU's best villain to date.  Even though his plan is monstrous (and based on the stupid overpopulation myth), you understand his motives and even feel for him at the lengths his is willing to go to accomplish his mission (which are horrifying).  Behind the camera, the Russos manage to balance the numerous characters and plot lines into an exciting epic, bouncing from New York to Wakanda to even outer space.  They match up the characters perfectly, from Iron Man & Dr. Strange to Rocket & Thor, giving the right level of heart between the epic action, which sets a new standard for blockbuster movies.  Simply put, the kind of movie that willl satisfy MCU fans and leave you clamoring for the next Avengers film.","displayName":"Johnathon W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/664155011/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T15:49:23.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-06T15:18:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"857932456","realm":"RT","displayName":"Johnathon W","accountLink":"/user/id/857932456"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie, maybe best one yet, did a great job with a huge cast all getting spotlight and story.
