I personally felt there was too much fighting and not enough plot. As a result, I was bored at times. I've seen almost all of the comic book movies and liked most of them. However, I wouldn't call myself a comic book superhero fan. As a result of not being a comic book fan, I was not familiar with many of the superheroes in this film for much of the movie. Did I miss a superhero movie or two where they were introduced? Apparently. Since there was little plot to introduce them in this movie, I felt no connection with most of them. This movie did not have a happy ending but I suspect they'll fix that with a sequel. Since I didn't feel much of a connection to most of the characters, I didn't mourn their loss too much.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-17T15:05:02.755Z","updateDate":"2018-05-17T15:05:18.889Z","user":{"userId":"964255766","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/964255766"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Very good movie.

I have no comment on the movie until the final fight, which it was so short but thrilling. Then I saw Thanos weak... So weak. I wanted to see more avengers vs Thanos. The ending was great, exciting and thrilling. Which is makes me so excited and impatient to see the next avengers movie, which I hope it has an epic final fight. But it really is the best movie in the MCU.","displayName":"Kirollos N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-17T13:41:46.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-18T08:08:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"976704669","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kirollos N","accountLink":"/user/id/976704669"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good time, plain and simple.

With great action sequences and, for the most part, spectacular visual effects, this movie has a great payoff to a whole 10 years worth of films in this series. While at times I felt as though the action scenes were cut short by switching back to a calmer and funnier scenes, where the tension got set back, I believe this is one of the greatest pop-culture events that we have experienced in the past decade. You can chalk this up to be a great, fun and action-packed superhero movies in recent years.","displayName":"Cooper R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-17T12:52:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-17T13:08:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"977069398","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cooper R","accountLink":"/user/id/977069398"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best movie I have ever seen.","displayName":"Tamilselvan D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-17T12:20:08.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-27T23:46:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"977272936","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tamilselvan D","accountLink":"/user/id/977272936"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was a blast!
