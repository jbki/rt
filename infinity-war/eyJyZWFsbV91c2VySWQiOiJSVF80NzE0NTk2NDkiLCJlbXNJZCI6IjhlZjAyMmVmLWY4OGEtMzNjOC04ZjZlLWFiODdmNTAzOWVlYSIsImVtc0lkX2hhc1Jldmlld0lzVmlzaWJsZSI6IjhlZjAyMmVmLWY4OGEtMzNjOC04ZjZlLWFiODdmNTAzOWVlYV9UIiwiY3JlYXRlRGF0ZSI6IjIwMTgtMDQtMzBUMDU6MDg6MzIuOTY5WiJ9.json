This is literally the biggest scale production movie I've ever watched in my life. ---***NOW FOR SPOILER***---\nThe movies starts off from the last moment of #thorragnarok . Asgardians killed and #Thor is seriously injured. #Thanos already destroyed Xandar & took the Power stone. Thanos bashes #Hulk until his so down. #Heimdall uses all his strength to shoot Hulk into hyperspace till he lands into The Sanctum. Thanos came to #Loki for Space stone. Thanos kills Loki & take the Space stone & let Thor die.\n\nThor reaches to #Milano where the guardians save him. He instructs #Starlord & #Gamora to go to #Knowhere to get Reality stone from collector. Thor brings #rocket & #groot to Nidaviller to forge his new hammer #Stormbreaker. In Knowhere Thanos already found the Reality stone & abducts Gamora to Titan.\n\nThanos uses Nebula to make Gamora tell the location of the #SoulStone. She finally breaks the pot and its in #Vormir. Thanos and Gamora go to Vormir and confronts Red Skull (yeah that guy, SHOCKING!). For the stone Thanos has to sacrifice one soul who he loves truly. In tears he pushes Gamora to death and gets the SOUL STONE ?????? Thor risked his life to forge the hammer & Groot cuts his hand to bind the hammer as handle (best scene I loved). Cap brings Vision and his entire team to #Wakanda. There they have the biggest massive WAR ever!\n\nThanos fights #IronMan #spiderman #starlord #mantis #drax & #drstrange\nStrange bargains the Time stone for Stark's life. Thanos finally comes to EARTH - WAKANDA for Mind stone. Thanos rips Mind stone & Vision dies. Thor fights Thanos and Thanos snaps his finger! ??\n\n#infinitywar\n#avengers","displayName":"Sutheswaran N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/633957289/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T04:58:32.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T05:04:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"878093711","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sutheswaran N","accountLink":"/user/id/878093711"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is quite an accomplishment.
