It is a long movie, but I thought the pacing was good. It reminded me of when I watched The Fellowship of the Ring in theaters. The credits roll and you almost can’t wait for the next one.

Despite this face some believe that CW was too serious for a marvel movie, and some believe that Ragnarok was way too funny for a Thor movie. Avengers: Infinity War is guaranteed to really get to fans emotionally by having some of the most serious things that have ever been in a marvel movie and at the same time having some of the best jokes.
