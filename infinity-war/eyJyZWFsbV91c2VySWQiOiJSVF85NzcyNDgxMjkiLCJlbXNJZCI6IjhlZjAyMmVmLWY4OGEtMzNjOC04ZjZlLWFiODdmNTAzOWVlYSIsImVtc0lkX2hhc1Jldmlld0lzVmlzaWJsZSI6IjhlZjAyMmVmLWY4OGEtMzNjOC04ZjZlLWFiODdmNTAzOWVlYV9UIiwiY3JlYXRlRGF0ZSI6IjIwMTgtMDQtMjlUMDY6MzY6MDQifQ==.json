It's not a popular position but this new thing feels more of the same. A big spectacle with yet another big bad guy and just a bigger bunch of our heroes taking it on. I'd rather see these great lead in films tell the whole story without a big show piece like the Avengers films. Except the first that is at it was needed to have them firm and work together in that proper context.","displayName":"jas c","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T06:08:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T06:13:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"972673575","realm":"RT","displayName":"jas c","accountLink":"/user/id/972673575"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"}]}
