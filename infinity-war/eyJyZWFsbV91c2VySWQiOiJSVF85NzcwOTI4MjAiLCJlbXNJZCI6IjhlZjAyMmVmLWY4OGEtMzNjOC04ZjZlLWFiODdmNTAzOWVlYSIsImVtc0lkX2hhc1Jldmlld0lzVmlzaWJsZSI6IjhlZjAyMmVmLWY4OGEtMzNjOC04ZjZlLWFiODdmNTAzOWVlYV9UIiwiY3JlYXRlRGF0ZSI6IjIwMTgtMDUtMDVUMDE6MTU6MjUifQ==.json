Those battles, that are sadly the basic essence of the film, leave little time for story, dialog (the amount of dialog between black widow and bruce, in face of the dynamic between the two was in my opinion very sad), character interaction etc.\n\nGreat potential, little pay off. alongside with the now proven theory that a marvel movie will always score good reviews, not matter its quality!
