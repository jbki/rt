It has some great fight scenes, visuals and leaves you wondering what comes next to the characters. Is there a way back to solve the problems? The choreography for the battle sequences in this film look amazing. This film also has some unique visuals of a star getting started up that has never been seen before on screen. I love the score by Alan Silverstri. This film takes place immediately after Thor Ragnarok. This is one film where you defiantly need to see particular films in order to understand this film like Dr. Strange, Thor Ragnarok, Captain America Civil War, Guardians of the Galaxy part one. This has you wondering is there a way to bring characters back? I love the chemistry between all the characters. This is a film worth seeing on the big screen to be able to see all the visuals. I like the team split up in this film of the Guardians. It was great. This film tells us there is no Guardians of the Galaxy 3, Spider-Man sequel, Black Panther sequel, until Avengers 4 comes out. You have to stay for the Post credits to see what happens to SHIELD This has one single post credit scene after all the credits that is kind of important to the film after Ant-Man and the Wasp and Avengers part 4.
