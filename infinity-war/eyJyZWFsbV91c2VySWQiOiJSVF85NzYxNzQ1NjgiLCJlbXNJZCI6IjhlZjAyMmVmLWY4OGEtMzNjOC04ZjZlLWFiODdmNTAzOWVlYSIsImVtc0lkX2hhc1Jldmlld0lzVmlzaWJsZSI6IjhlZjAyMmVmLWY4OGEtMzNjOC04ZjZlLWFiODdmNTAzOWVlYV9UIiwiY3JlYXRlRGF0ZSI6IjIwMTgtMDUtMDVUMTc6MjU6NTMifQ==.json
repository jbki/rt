I thought the plot was convoluted and contrived.  The motivations of the villain made absolutely no sense.  Captain America looked like he had been in a superhero protection program.  Worse of all, the ending (which I thought would never come) made no sense at all.  All of a sudden, Avengers start to \"disappear\"?  LAME.  The action sequences were good and there were some funny one liners...that's why it gets 2 stars.","displayName":"Mike R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T17:22:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T17:26:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"977258337","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike R","accountLink":"/user/id/977258337"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very Awesome I Loved all the actions and I I loved the Shocking ending it made me cry I Would Gives This Movie TWO THUMBS UP!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/495532267491484/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T17:19:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T17:22:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"976751711","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976751711"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"I'm a Marvel fan - love Avengers movies - but this was just terrible.

Me pareció muy entretenida, mas no una buena película. Un caso raro este, porque depende de otras 18 películas. No creo que funcione como stand alone, y al final esto es cine, no una serie de tv. O más o menos. Es como la primera franquicia de cine que funciona como serie de tv: Sí no has seguido las otras películas, pues esta debería ser un desastre. No así Avengers 1 (2012) o Civil War (2016), por ejemplo. Thanos sí me parece sorprendentemente bien trabajado. Podría haberse llamado \"Episodio 19 temporada 1: Thanos\", jajaja.\n\nEntretención pura, mas no puedo llamarla buena película. Igual es mucho mejor que Ultron, así como tb me parece que es de esos eventos de entretención que hay que ver en el cine. 3.5 de 5.","displayName":"Pablo B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/593577659/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T16:58:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T16:59:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"820286168","realm":"RT","displayName":"Pablo B","accountLink":"/user/id/820286168"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I don't feel so good","displayName":"Joshua B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T16:38:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T16:43:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"977258296","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joshua B","accountLink":"/user/id/977258296"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing movie and would love to see it again but really didn't want so many of them to die.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1959844824330276/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T16:34:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T16:37:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"977258290","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977258290"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I took my 15 year old son to see this as well and we don't understand why it has such high ratings. The best scenes involved dialogue with Chris Pratt's character and his Guardians crew, Tony Stark and Dr. Strange. The others such as Captain America, Vision, Black Panther, etc. didn't really add to the movie at all and weren't funny or clever. They really should replace Mark Ruffalo and get someone else to play the Incredible Hulk. He comes off as a big wuss and - spoiler alert - never manages to become the Hulk. \n\nThese movies seem to go overboard and throw so much at you that it gets rather confusing and boring. The battle scene with Capt. America and Black Panther is a case in point. I found myself bored as though I've seen this scene played out in other movies, e.g. Lord of the Rings, and it just came off as derivative and unoriginal. It seems that all great action movies such as the Batman series (with Christian Bale), Spiderman series (with Toby McGuire), etc. had such simple plots that were easy to follow and enjoyable. At 2 1/2 hours long, this movie seemed to go on and on to \"Infinity\" . . . \n\nOne other thing I find humorous are fans that are actually angry at Chris Pratt for what happens in the movie. Don't these people realize he is just an actor playing a part in a make believe movie? The best scenes in the film are with Chris Pratt.\n\nA better than average popcorn flick but, seriously, it will be utterly forgettable in a year.","displayName":"Peter G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000842597349/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T16:28:00.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T16:55:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"957430634","realm":"RT","displayName":"Peter G","accountLink":"/user/id/957430634"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Fun movie.
