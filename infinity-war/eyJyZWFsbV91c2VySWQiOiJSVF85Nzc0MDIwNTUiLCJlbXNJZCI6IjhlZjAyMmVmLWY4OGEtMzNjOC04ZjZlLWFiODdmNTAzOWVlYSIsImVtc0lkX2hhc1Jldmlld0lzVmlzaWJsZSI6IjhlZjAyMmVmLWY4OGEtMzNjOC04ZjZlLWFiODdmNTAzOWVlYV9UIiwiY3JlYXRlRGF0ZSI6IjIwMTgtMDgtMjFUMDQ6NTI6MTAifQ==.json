It is entertaining and funny in the way that Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther brought to the screen with the interpersonal banter. I did feel that since the cast was so large there were competing subplots that were interfering with the telling of the story. One question: Why does everyone all of the sudden know what the Infinity Stones are and what their respective powers are when the build-up movies all but ignore delving into their backgrounds?\n\nOverall, this was an entertaining movie that is well worth a watch.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10214263453114726/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-20T09:04:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-20T09:11:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"977430312","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977430312"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"my dick is immeasurablY hard after wathcing this movie","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2100037586911846/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-20T07:01:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-20T07:02:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"977430156","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977430156"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Avengers: Infinity War is the best superheroes movie ever made.
