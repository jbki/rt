Infinity War is the culmination of 10 years of Marvel cinema magic, and they’re just getting started. With the biggest cast of superheroes to date, Infinity War pits the Avengers against their most dangerous and deadly opponent, Thanos the Mad Titan. Believe me when I say, they’ll be taking about this ending for years!

THATS CRAZY) a decent moment to shine, moments that made me jump out of my seat, exclaim in awe, or crack me up for 3 minutes straight! Thor, Gamora, Scarlet Witch, Ironman, Spiderman, Star Lord, Vision were my highlights from the group of heroes. But boy oh boy, what really impressed me was THANOS.\nHoly cow! Flat out saying this, he's probably my favourite on screen villain of all time. He destroys the avengers into mush, eats them, chews them up, spits them out and then proceeds to destroy them further. He brings the ruthlessness and fear factor, while also having immense depth, extremely solid motivation and oh so much emotion! ?? Halfway through the film Thanos was faced with a challenge, I don't want to spoil anything for anyone but my lord Josh Broling knocked that scene out of the park! The scariest villains are the ones who think they're doing the right thing. We can definitely add Thanos to that list. \nThe Score/Soundtrack was incredible, the use of music was super well done, Loved the hints of character themes as well as Thano's main theme. \nI've got nothing but praise for this film, goes by with a blisteringly fast pace. It's most incredible feat is probably how it manages to ride a perfectly balanced line with its funny, yet dark tone. One minute it had me laughing, the next minute scared for my life, the next cheering because of the crazy good action and the next making me sit there and weep.\nI don't need to tell anyone to go out there and watch this, in theathres, as soon as possible, because I know everyone's butts are going to be in the seats. This is an event, just like star wars back in the 70's. \nI'm going to look back at this 20 years from now and still remember how I felt watching this, sitting in my seat, chills down my spine, just having a heck of a time. \nAlso, THAT ENDING. Even after 3 viewing... I can't fathom nothing. CRAZY. #thanosdemandsyoursilence #10yearsofgreatness","displayName":"Rohaan W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1509975548/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T23:56:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T23:57:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"959470540","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rohaan W","accountLink":"/user/id/959470540"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"\"Avengers: Infinity War\" is an epic, thrilling, and emotionally heavy film that manages to live up to its large premise.
