The rest of the characters in the movie had solid, scene stealing portions of the movie. I liked the movie, would I see it again no, but it was a good movie, Thanos, Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, SpiderMan, Dr Strange, Guardians of the Galaxy, Vision, Scarlett Witch, Hulk all owned the movie, everybody else was an unnecessary side character.
