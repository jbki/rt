There are the typical fight scenes, hand wringing and comic relief courtesy of the Guardians of the Galaxy characters and Spiderman... And none of it moved me. The ending of the movie is implausible and not to be trusted at all. There is nothing new in this one... Wash, rinse and repeat is the mantra of MCU movies.
