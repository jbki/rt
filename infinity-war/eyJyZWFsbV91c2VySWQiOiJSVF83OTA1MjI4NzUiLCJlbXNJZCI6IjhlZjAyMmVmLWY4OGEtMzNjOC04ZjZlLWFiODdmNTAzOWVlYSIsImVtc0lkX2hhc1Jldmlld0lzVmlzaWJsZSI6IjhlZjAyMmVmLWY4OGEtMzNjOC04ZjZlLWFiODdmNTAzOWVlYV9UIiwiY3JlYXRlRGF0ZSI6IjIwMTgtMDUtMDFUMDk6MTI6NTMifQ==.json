Marvel raised the bar in making a fun, pulse pounding movie.  It is pretty difficult to make a movie with that many characters and sub-plots but they did it as about as best as possible.

It's the best in the MCU, a true masterpiece. The action scenes and battles are top notch, and Thanos is a great villain. Finally Marvel kills people, and that's what makes this movie impactful, even though it's quite obvious that not all deaths are permanent. Some critics are talking about way too many deaths etc. We are talking about the destruction of half the population in the UNIVERSE and its prevention. OBVIOUSLY there will be many deaths. Also, it's ridiculous that almost all the viewers loved the movie, yet a considerable amount of critics basically called it garbage. It focused on the right things, and was full of action and emotion. It's by far the most enjoyable marvel film ever, both plotwise and visually. The original star wars of our time.","displayName":"DespoinaK K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-01T08:30:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-01T08:38:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"977252410","realm":"RT","displayName":"DespoinaK K","accountLink":"/user/id/977252410"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 01, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Marvel Studios did it again, created another masterpiece.
