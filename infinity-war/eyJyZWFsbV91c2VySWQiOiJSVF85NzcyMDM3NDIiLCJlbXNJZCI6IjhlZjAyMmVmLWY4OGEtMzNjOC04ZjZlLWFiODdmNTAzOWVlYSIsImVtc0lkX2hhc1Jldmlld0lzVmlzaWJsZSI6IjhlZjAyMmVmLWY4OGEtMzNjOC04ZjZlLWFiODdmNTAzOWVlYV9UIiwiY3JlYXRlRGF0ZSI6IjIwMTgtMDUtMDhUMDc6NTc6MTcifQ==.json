So I didn't catch a lot of the plot points or lore. The action was really distracting too. 3 plot lines at once with tons of crazy shit happening and very quick art direction. I get it it's the kick off of action and the conclusion of a huge story arc but it kinda through me a bit. But, it was all made up by that ending.

Story was good. What broke the entire movie is the ending. It's garbage. I know it had to happen but seeing all these heroes die there's no way it's permanent so it's not believable. + The Captain Marvel at the end... And non sense with thor just throwing his axe in Thanos' chest while he could've beheaded him. But beheading is too dark for marvel so we had to suffer this bad ending. I recommend it thought, was fun to watch.","displayName":"Maxim P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T06:57:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-08T07:00:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"976865227","realm":"RT","displayName":"Maxim P","accountLink":"/user/id/976865227"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie has so many plotholes, there aren't any available for other movies.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1656256967743414/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T06:39:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-08T06:42:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"977261462","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977261462"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"the movie was awesome but the sad thing is when thanos snap his fingers some of then ture into dust.","displayName":"kerryn c","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T06:02:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T09:11:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"977261435","realm":"RT","displayName":"kerryn c","accountLink":"/user/id/977261435"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Phenomenal and fun.
