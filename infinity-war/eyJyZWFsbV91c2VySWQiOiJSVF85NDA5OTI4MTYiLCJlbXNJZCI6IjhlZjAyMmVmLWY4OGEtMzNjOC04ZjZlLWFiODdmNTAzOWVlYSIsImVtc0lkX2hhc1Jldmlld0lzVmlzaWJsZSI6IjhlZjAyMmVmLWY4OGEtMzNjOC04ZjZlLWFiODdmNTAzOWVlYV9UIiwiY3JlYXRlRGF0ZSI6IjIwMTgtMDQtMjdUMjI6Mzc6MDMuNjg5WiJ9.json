Tons of fanservice, especially for Marvel enthusiasts. But this movie is different. It's high stakes unlike any other previous Marvel. \nThanos is a great villain. And the movie was much more emotional than I expected. All in all, my high expectations were met. And to say anything would ruin it. So enjoy and stay for the end credits!","displayName":"James N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/506670421/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T22:35:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T22:35:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"809073433","realm":"RT","displayName":"James N","accountLink":"/user/id/809073433"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing movie.

It could have been safe to play down the evil, grief and cost of this mounting conflict, but the Russo Brothers held nothing back. The infinity Gauntlet is (and has been for 27 years) my favorite comic story ever. This is by no means a direct adaptation, but it is so well written. This will be an interesting year, after most of MCU phase 2 was lighter and more humorous, this movie hits you in the gut. Over and over!  The themes set up in the movie were beautifully integrated and (it seems to me)  it Layed the ground work for Avengers 4 to actually be deeper and more satisfying than the comic version. Despite several key players being absent, the roster they have were utilized perfectly! I can't wait to see it again, and I am so ready for the next chapter!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10213547096414216/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T22:34:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T22:47:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"976597697","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976597697"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The new motivation for Thanos is so much better than the comic books.
