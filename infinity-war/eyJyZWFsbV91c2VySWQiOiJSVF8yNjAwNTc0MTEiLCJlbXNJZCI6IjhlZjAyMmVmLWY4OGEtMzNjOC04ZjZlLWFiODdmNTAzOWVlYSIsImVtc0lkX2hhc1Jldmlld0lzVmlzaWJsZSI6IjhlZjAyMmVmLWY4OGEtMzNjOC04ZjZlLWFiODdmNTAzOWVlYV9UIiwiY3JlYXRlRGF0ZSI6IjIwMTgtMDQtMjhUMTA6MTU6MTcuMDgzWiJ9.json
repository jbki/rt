You know it's coming but when the heroes get together it's an emotional payoff.  And parts are genuinely distressing,  On a technical note it's a mind blowing production.  A milestone in effects artistry.  Bravo.","displayName":"Greg%20 D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T10:15:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T10:18:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"976827606","realm":"RT","displayName":"Greg%20 D","accountLink":"/user/id/976827606"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was so perfect *-*","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1639135132845741/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T10:10:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T10:11:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"977127562","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977127562"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Lo m√°s grande, como colo colo","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1885064964885095/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T10:08:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T10:09:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245942","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977245942"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"You are an idiot if you don't give this a 5 star rating","displayName":"Nathaniel S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000660185700/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T10:07:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T10:09:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"975839276","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nathaniel S","accountLink":"/user/id/975839276"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"OMFG THIS BLEW MY MIND, DEFINITELY WATCH! 5*","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/244591196281752/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T10:04:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T10:05:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245930","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977245930"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is the best.

Beings are overpopulated so I will force half of them to die??? This film never made the case that overpopulation was an issue in the universe or that all beings in the universe had given up hope and needed to commit a desperate act. Sorry MCU you missed on this one.
