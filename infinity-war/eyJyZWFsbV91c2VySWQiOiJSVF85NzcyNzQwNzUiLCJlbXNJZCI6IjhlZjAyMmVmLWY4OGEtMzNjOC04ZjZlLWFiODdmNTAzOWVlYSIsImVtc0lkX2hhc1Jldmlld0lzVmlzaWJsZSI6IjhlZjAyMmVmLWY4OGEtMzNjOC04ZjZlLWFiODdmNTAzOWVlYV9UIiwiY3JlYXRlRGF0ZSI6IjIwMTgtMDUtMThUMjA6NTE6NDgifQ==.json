Out of any superhero movie i've seen, none has ever made me as stressed and involved as Infinity War has. Every battle, every punch is a moment of dread for our heroes. I am also amazed by how well the Russo Brothers and the actors were able to balance comedy with the movie's overall dark tone. No joke undercuts the seriousness of the movie, and let's our laugh after being traumatized from the event preceding it. To conclude this I am emotionally scarred and will never recover until Avengers 4 comes out, and even then I may never find acceptance,","displayName":"Neonindt E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-18T19:54:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-11T15:56:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"977275475","realm":"RT","displayName":"Neonindt E","accountLink":"/user/id/977275475"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing movie, So enjoyable and worth seeing over and over again.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1987863441478502/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-18T19:42:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-18T19:43:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"977102720","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977102720"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"it was amazing and very sad, i was in tears a few times.","displayName":"Carrie G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-18T18:47:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-18T18:48:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"976493578","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carrie G","accountLink":"/user/id/976493578"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"same ole same ole comic book movie. ho hum!","displayName":"Justin C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-18T18:45:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-18T18:46:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"953482283","realm":"RT","displayName":"Justin C","accountLink":"/user/id/953482283"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"May 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"You will love and hate this dumbass beautiful film","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10154117582915436/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-18T18:36:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-18T18:37:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"977275377","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977275377"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie to tie the MCU together.

Long but filled to the brim with heart, humor and fantastic storytelling. It's great to see so many characters come together finally after 10 years of fantastic movies. Josh Brolin knocks it out of the park with his fantastic portrayal of Thanos, who (in my opinion) is definitely the best villain to ever grace us with his presence on the big screen.","displayName":"Ethan S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-18T17:33:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-18T17:37:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"977275301","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ethan S","accountLink":"/user/id/977275301"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 18, 2018"}]}
