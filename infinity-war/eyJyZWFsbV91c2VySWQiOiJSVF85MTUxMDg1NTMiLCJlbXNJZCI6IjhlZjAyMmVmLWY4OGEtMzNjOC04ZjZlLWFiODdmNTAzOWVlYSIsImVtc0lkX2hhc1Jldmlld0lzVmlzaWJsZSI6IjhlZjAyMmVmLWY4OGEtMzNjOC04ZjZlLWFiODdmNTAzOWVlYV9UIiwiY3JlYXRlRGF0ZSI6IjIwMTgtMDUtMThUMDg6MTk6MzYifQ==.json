Dull scriptwriting and duller portrayal of its characters tortured into attempting humour. It seems that all the characters abilities and limits are now devoid of reason or past logic and dictated only by the needs to bring about this collosal circle-jerk which makes the whole story utterely meaningless. I have never ever reviewed anything on here but the thought that Marvel broke box-office records with this and that some people might assume it was a good film was too much to bear.","displayName":"Alex G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-18T07:57:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-18T08:06:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"977274483","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex G","accountLink":"/user/id/977274483"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"May 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Infinity War is everything I wanted it to be and more ! - I love the direction of this story and what is to come in 2019. This movie is for Thanos don't get it twisted. I loved the motive behind his character. The connection between him and Gamora hit home for me. Thor was a standout, especially when he arrives in the battle. Peter Dinklage was a surprise I do like how they switched up his character (watch the movie to find out) but I felt like he didn't fit. Outside of that I have no complaints about this movie that's why I gave it 4 stars. The MCU has been growing on my the last few years. Honestly but sadly, it has surpassed Star Wars as my favorite franchise. I enjoy not having political agendas heavily pushed into movies I enjoy. Loved this movie !!!!","displayName":"Spencer R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-18T07:45:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-18T08:08:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"976960528","realm":"RT","displayName":"Spencer R","accountLink":"/user/id/976960528"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Fun, exciting, shocking, heartbreaking.

The film has already broken the ticket sale record and still has people talking. The climax of a 10 year build up to the final. The final big conclusion to save the universe. Bringing together all of Earth's mightiest heroes and some new allies from across the galaxy. The movie is overall a hit. Great story, the character are reaching full development.  The picture and sound choices were new and creative. They made everything look so real and not so superficial. The main external conflict was the Avengers coming together to defeat their opposing enemy, Thanos. Only one problem is the changing of some of the characters stories. They tell us about these characters and their past, but then in this movie they change a few. It's a confusing timeline in general, but this movie made it alittle harder to put together.  But, overall the movie is a great 5 Star classic Marvel hit.","displayName":"Lauren R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-18T07:11:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-18T07:28:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"977274417","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lauren R","accountLink":"/user/id/977274417"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Bringing so many characters together in one film while at the same time delivering on a 10 year build up is impressive.  While I enjoyed Captain America Civil War, I was weary of the idea of having even more characters on screen for Infinity War.  But Marvel Studios and the Russos pulled it off as decisively as Thanos pulled off his finger snap. With the way Infinity War ends, I am left wanting to consume everything leading up to the next Avengers film. I mean, I never thought I would be excited to see then next Ant Man film as well as Captain Marvel. I liked the first Ant man, I just didn't see myself with such anticipation of the sequel. Now thanks to Infinity War I will definitely be taking my family to see both films. Job well done Kevin Feige! What you have done with the MCU is brilliant and wonderful!","displayName":"George G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-18T06:54:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-21T07:01:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"977274304","realm":"RT","displayName":"George G","accountLink":"/user/id/977274304"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 18, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Marvel's most ambitious movie of all!
