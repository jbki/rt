I am still staggered by the movie. I had grand concerns that the film would be unable to meet my lofty expectations. Expectations that have been built up over the course of a decade and several top-quality films in the MCU franchise...\n\n...well let me assure you, these expectations were well and truly met, and in some respects, exceeded.\n\nInfinity War was an extravaganza. An orgy of action, a veritable buffet of drama, and a total leg slapper. Some Marvel/Disney films have been slated for their very \"Disney\" feel, but somehow this film manages to escape all that, delivering a properly adult film that absolutely caters to the kids in equal measure. I found myself constantly needing to close my mouth, such was my ever dropping jaw. The scenes were not only hugely climactic and powerful, but the visuals were spectacular and thoroughly engaging.\n\nI put all of this down to the Russos. They can walk on water in my humble opinion. They took what could easily have been the most difficult job in cinema right now, bringing together this simply massive group of characters, and the actors who portray them, and serving them up on screen in a symphony of excellence. \n\nSome of the pre-release criticism was that the audience would be immediately disconnected as there'd be no true consequence, given there was another Avengers instalment due next year. The Russo Brothers managed to dial up the emotion to the proverbial 11, because it certainly had my heart beating, and my sympathies flowing. Yes, some characters will be brought to life again, but its not even about that. The portrayal and direction was such that you still felt all of their pain, and the nuanced approach to their ultimate demise was handled with aplomb. \n\nGenuinely the best film yet in the MCU, followed for me, by Captain America: Winter Soldier. No luck there. Russo Brothers again, and proving they are easily the best of the MCU film makers.\n\nWatch the film as many times as you can. Worth it.","displayName":"Simon P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-11T03:11:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-11T03:20:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"977535746","realm":"RT","displayName":"Simon P","accountLink":"/user/id/977535746"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Arguably the most complete superhero film ever made","displayName":"Bo K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-10T20:06:09.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-10T20:06:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"934597308","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bo K","accountLink":"/user/id/934597308"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Amazing film which did a great job bringing together all that the MCU was building up to.
