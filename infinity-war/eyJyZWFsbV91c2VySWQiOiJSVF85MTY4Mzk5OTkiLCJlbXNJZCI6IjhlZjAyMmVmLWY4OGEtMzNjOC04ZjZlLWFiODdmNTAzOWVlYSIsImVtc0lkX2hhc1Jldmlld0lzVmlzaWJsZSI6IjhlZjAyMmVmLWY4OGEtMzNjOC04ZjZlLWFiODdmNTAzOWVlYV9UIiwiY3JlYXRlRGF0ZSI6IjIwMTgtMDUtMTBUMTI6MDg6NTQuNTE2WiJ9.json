If that's your idea of a good movie, by all means see it. Almost no plot. Absolutely no character development. The scene in which Starlord, unable to keep his mind on task, destroys the allies' chances of winning, was so predictable as to make me to want to beat the writers' heads. This is the first movie I've seen in a long time where I was really tempted to walk out in the middle. Had I been alone, I would have done so.","displayName":"Ted S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-10T09:38:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-10T09:44:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977147844","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ted S","accountLink":"/user/id/977147844"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This was a great movie.

The ending sucked except for the fact the movie finally ended.  It is overrated.  Characters are ... under developed and too many.  Plot too complex.  Humor lost in the excessive details and untold backstory.  This might be a comic book nerds dream come true but it falls far short in creating a enjoyable story because it tries to hard to do so little while using special effects to cover it's shortfalls.  The first Avenger was FAR superior and it's followup is nothing but a cluster...of characters who don't have a clue what there part is in the movie.  Totally disappointed.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10211083717104412/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-10T08:04:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-10T08:44:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977263512","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977263512"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"May 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best MCU Movie Ever!!
