However this was due mainly to the surprises the movie has in store. Upon re-watches the film doesn't hold up very well which I find is a common flaw with most MARVEL movies. The film also feels less like a film and more of an experience and I felt some scenes were a little underwhelming because of how certain characters were utilized, especially the Black Panther characters. Also, some of the deaths just felt forced and bad particularly the death of a certain character about halfway through the movie. However the film is still fun, the directing is   strong, Thanos is a great villain, and a few of the characters are allowed some defining, unforgettable moments. Overall the film is worth the nearly decade-long buildup even if it isn't as good as some past MARVEL movies.","displayName":"Ben D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-19T16:47:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-19T16:56:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"977326587","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ben D","accountLink":"/user/id/977326587"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Very big movie, lots of characters that I've been longing to see together for years. However, the story to be told is so big that it's being spread over two movies, sort of. The original intention was two movies with one story but the studio decided to try and create two movies in Infinity War and Avengers 4 with a continued stories, like a comic series. It left me longing for finding out what happens to the rest of the MCU and their connected series. Agents of Shield and The Defenders are set as outliers but connected to the MCU so they have to be connected. This was one thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars.","displayName":"Rob C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/794180084/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-19T16:02:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-19T16:09:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"784034005","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rob C","accountLink":"/user/id/784034005"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"entertaining, I'm cant be the only person tired of every big movie being a comic book. which marvel movie won best picture.......","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-19T15:34:32.427Z","updateDate":"2018-06-19T15:34:32.427Z","user":{"userId":"948483016","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/948483016"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Might be the best Marvel movie yet!

Yes, Marvel is nearly perfect, but I was also worried that we would have another \"Spider-Man 3\" or \"Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice\" situation where it's too overstuffed with characters that it becomes hard to follow. This is not the case. It does jump around from place to place frequently, and I wish the plot had flowed better, but I was still able to follow what was going on. This has possibly the best villain in all of the MCU! Thanos is the Darth Vader of this franchise! He's the villain you love to hate and are genuinely afraid of. The actors bounce off of each other very well and the dialogue is as fast-paced and witty as we've come to expect from Marvel. While at times, it does feel like watching a bunch of video game cutscenes edited together, the movie is so enthralling that my first reaction to the credits (other than pure surprise for reasons I don't dare spoil) was \"It's over already?! It just started 20 minutes ago? What? It started almost 3 hours ago?! How is that possible?\" That's how much this film pulled me in! It's well worth the 10 year wait! It's amazing to see all these characters interact with each other! There are some really amazing shots and moments, which again, I won't spoil. There's a reason Marvel was unusually secretive with this film. Other than the story not flowing as well as it should have, there isn't anything to complain about with this film.\nGrade: A-   9/10   4/5 stars","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1664216783613708/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-19T11:45:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-19T11:45:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977300631","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977300631"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 19, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The end was too much of a bummer","displayName":"Scott P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-19T11:43:14.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-19T11:43:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"977326488","realm":"RT","displayName":"Scott P","accountLink":"/user/id/977326488"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 19, 2018"}]}
