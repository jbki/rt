What I can tell you is the bare basics of what you will be witnessing. And that is as follows: Everything you've seen, everything you know, is wrong. Your expectations are wrong. You are not prepared for what this movie has to throw at you. YOU'RE NOT. I surely wasn't; I found myself realizing my mouth was gaped open multiple times. Avengers: Infinity War is the cultivation of everything Marvel has built and it executed it almost flawlessly. There are only two flaws that can be found here. One, the pacing is a bit wonky at parts, as scenes cut away and tones can be shifted. Two, some characters don't get the spotlight that you might want them to. But these flaws are easily forgiven. As this movie delivers on EVERYTHING. The action is exceptional. The emotion is POWERFUL. The music by Silvestri hits you in the gut with every note. The story is at odds, taking turns in ways that you will never see coming, not even with clairvoyance. Now, I can't say much, but what I will say, is that Josh Brolin has given us, quite possibly, one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. He is scary, compassionate, charismatic, but most of all, empathetic. The Russo Brothers also directed their asses off and made their best work yet. That's all I can really say. You need to go into this movie blind like I did, because by the end you won't know what's coming next, you'll be speechless. So until the next Avengers movie arrives, I'll watch it, then watch it again, because it's the only movie we got for a while.","displayName":"Noah P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T10:48:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T02:09:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"971076580","realm":"RT","displayName":"Noah P","accountLink":"/user/id/971076580"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is an Epic Marvel Masterpiece!
