Everyone in the movie theater was audibly disapointed.  Everyone i have talked to (in multiple states) have literally hated this movie, so I'm perplexed by all the 5 star reviews.  Kids are literally crying since this movie was so depressing.  It's obviously a part one of part two so just keep in mind you are seeing ony half of the movie.  I've written this review several times and it hasn't been posted yet, so maybe bad reviews are being filtered.","displayName":"Jennie M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T08:57:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T10:52:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"977026243","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jennie M","accountLink":"/user/id/977026243"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"After 10 years, Infinity war is here and it does not disappoint. Thanos has been teased time and time again, the MCU brings the mad titan to life in the most conveying way. He is up there with Loki and Killmonger.

The way they had used untied ropes to reveal the soul stones location in a way no one expected. The plot was believable, I understood what Thanos wanted(even though I didn't agree with his ways), and the emotional effects of the movie hit me hard because I have loved this seris ever since it started on may 2nd 2008. Also I wish the kept the release date of may 4th because that's the day the first avengers moivie came out.","displayName":"Owen V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T08:54:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T09:13:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245750","realm":"RT","displayName":"Owen V","accountLink":"/user/id/977245750"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Greatest fucking movie ever","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/694018220768568/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T08:51:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-27T13:03:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245743","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977245743"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
