This is yet another piece of evidence that Marvel have mastered the art of comic book movie. Walking into this, I had a bit of concern  on how the Russos would handle 60 + characters with distinct backstories, but they handled it exeptionally well and surpassed all standards. I pray that you all get to see this 'marvel' of a movie.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2100773500206721/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T01:44:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T01:49:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241589","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977241589"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was more of a horror movie.

Nothing you expect, all theories made did not come true. This will make you cry, laugh, and kept in wondering for a year. But the directors have also lied a lot about the movie, which kinda gave a bit of false hope. The ending is not one marvel usually makes.","displayName":"Abedulrahman K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T01:38:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T01:42:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241574","realm":"RT","displayName":"Abedulrahman K","accountLink":"/user/id/977241574"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Buenisima esta mierda, la mejor pelicula del año hp!!!","displayName":"Roger B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T01:36:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T01:38:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"931937869","realm":"RT","displayName":"Roger B","accountLink":"/user/id/931937869"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"looking forward to part 2","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T01:35:30.603Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T01:35:30.603Z","user":{"userId":"260121468","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260121468"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What Marvel Studios pulled off is something beyond excellence. Numerous Characters in one movie and it delivered perfectly. Aside from a little pacing issues, which is bound to happen because of the huge cast, this movie is extremely good. Every Character got their moments to shine and Thanos is hands down the most complex villain, in an outstanding way. The Action sequences are JAW DROPPING. And the comic timings were seamless as well. This movie had to have some comical moments because it's pretty dark this time around. Worth every penny. Glad I went for the First day first show experience. A huge round of applause for the entire Marvel Studios.","displayName":"Aryaan P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T01:35:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T01:45:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241567","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aryaan P","accountLink":"/user/id/977241567"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Didn’t fulfilled the high expectations.
