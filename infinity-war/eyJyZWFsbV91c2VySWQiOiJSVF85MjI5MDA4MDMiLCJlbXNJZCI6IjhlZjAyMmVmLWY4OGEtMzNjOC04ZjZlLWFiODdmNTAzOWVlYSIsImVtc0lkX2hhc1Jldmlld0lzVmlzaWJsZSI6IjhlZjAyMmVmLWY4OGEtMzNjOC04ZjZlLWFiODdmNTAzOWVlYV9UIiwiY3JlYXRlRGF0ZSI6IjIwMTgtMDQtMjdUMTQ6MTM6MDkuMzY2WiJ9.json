It gives enough time for everyone and swaps between everyone enough to keep you on your toes while not completely forgetting others exist.  Infinity War, if i'm being picky, has one minor flaw and that is that the Russo's directed GotG scenes and not Gunn.  They just don't get the same performance out of that cast that James Gunn seems to.  Quill as a character in this film was SUPER annoying, which made his scenes really irritating and hard to care about.  Even at the end of the film i was like 'meh' to him, even though he is probably my second or third favorite MCU character,  But his lack was Thor's gain.  Thor honestly makes this film(about darn time) even more awesome - i just wish that he got more time with Hulk - since Ragnarok was so good with their relationship.  This movie has wide reaching ramifications all around, and after viewing it is that made clear why only two more films are dropping in the meantime until the forth installment comes.  \nCheck it out in the theater for sure, probably worth extra views to see everything.","displayName":"Jonathan P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T14:12:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T14:22:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"964896388","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonathan P","accountLink":"/user/id/964896388"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"epic...as youd expext....soooooo good","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10214935673964732/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T14:12:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T14:13:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"976977521","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976977521"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie in marvel cinematic universe yet.

The Russo Brothers, on the other hand, have, for the third time in a row, achieved another masterful adaptation.

Just enough levity to keep it from falling into dreadful territory, it never takes away the sense of doom.
