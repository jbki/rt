The humor didn't feel placed very well, and a few of the dark moments were ruined by unnecessary gags, but after that hour ended, I knew that this film was going to be wonderful. The action sequences were dazzling and incredibly exciting, and it made me giddy to see all of these complex characters in the same movie. Thanos is definitely my favorite villain, and he brought this new emotion and sensation of darkness to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that was unforgettable -- Josh Brolin's performance was fabulous. There were several plot twists as well that left me jaw-dropped, and I've never really felt like that while watching a Marvel film before this. A few scenes did drag on and as I said previously, the first hour of this film wasn't very enjoyable for me, but in the end, Infinity War had all the emotions and excitement that I needed to be in this film and I loved it. 96%","displayName":"Movie F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T09:38:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-03T08:51:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"976844425","realm":"RT","displayName":"Movie F","accountLink":"/user/id/976844425"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Exceptional movie, really brilliant especially considering the fact that so many characters had to appear in the movie. If the ending perhaps bummed you out, i suggest reading up on the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and where they are headed. All in all, no dull moments, humorous and a well written and portrayed villain...

This is why Marvel rules. The villains are complex. The heroes are flawed. The stories are well developed, and while the visuals, special effects, musical score, etc. are stunning, it's the writing that rules. Also, enough easter eggs to know our beloved heroes come back. Oh, but I think that Tony Stark will have a son who will become the next Iron Man.","displayName":"Ana M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T09:19:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T09:22:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"977257822","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ana M","accountLink":"/user/id/977257822"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Everything about the film was amazing.
