Thanos is easily the best antagonist of the MCU, with genuine moral depth and intimidation (Ebony Maw is also a stand-out). Many characters shine brightly in this film, while others are wasted or used poorly (at least in the theatrical cut). The screenplay has a few problems with exposition, logic and a few tonal shifts. Alan Silvestri's score is incredible, the 2.5 hour running time felt shockingly quick to my pleasant surprise, and the ending is powerfully impactful. Avengers: Infinity War is nevertheless an overwhelming and ambitious blockbuster extravaganza that is the beginning of an even greater culmination for the MCU.","displayName":"Steven V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T17:17:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T17:50:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"949849085","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steven V","accountLink":"/user/id/949849085"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Infinity War is the best MCU movie.

Finally an MCU movie with an interesting villain. Thanos was easily the real star of the show.\nBut make no mistake. The rest of the Avengers are still likable characters thanks to the good script and the awesome performances from what I consider a group of the best Hollywood actors nowadays.\nPersonally, my favourite scenes were thanks to Robert Downey Jr and Benedict Cumberbach. And It's awesome the Rossos decided to make them on the same team so that we could see that perfect chemistry between both actors\nThe rest were awesome as usual.

This movie doesn't truly have a beginning or arguably even a middle, rather it's a series of endings which does the cinematic universe it has created justice whilst paying you off for your invested time and pulling out your heart. Because of its epic scope and multiple threads tied to other movies, Infinity War should not be thought of just 1 movie or event, but rather as 18 and as such I don't believe it can solely be scored as just 1 movie which is something we have never seen before (maybe arguably Star Wars can be viewed this way but even each of those films aren't so intertwined with each other, especially now with the Sequel Trilogy loosening many themes and concepts previously set and ignoring it's source and EU). Because of this, I would take a lot of the reviews, especially from the \"top critics\" who may be ignorant to the intention here or too stubborn to shift their reviews accordingly, but overall this film by itself is still great even if you haven't seen the 17 prior and for the historic cinematic event that it is, it lives up to the hype (which I had prior believed would prove to be an insurmountable task) and is definietly worth your ticket, just be prepared to leave the cinema exhausted, with no emmotion spared.","displayName":"Azkanta L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T17:03:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T21:48:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246819","realm":"RT","displayName":"Azkanta L","accountLink":"/user/id/977246819"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
