It has excellent visual effects, epic action sequences, great humor, excellent and charismatic performances, and one of the best villains ever put to screen. I can understand why people would like this more than endgame, because both are phenomenal movies. For me, personally, endgame is better; but this is still a fantastic movie.","displayName":"Caleb R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-24T05:56:08.000Z","updateDate":"2019-11-21T12:29:12.539Z","user":{"userId":"977994165","realm":"RT","displayName":"Caleb R","accountLink":"/user/id/977994165"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Avengers Infinity War was a emotional rollercoaster with a gut punching ending.

Josh Brolin as Thanos is excellent as the villain as he has both depth and an intimidating presence whenever on screen. This is quite possibly Marvel's darkest movie, and yet it is plenty of excellent humor in it as well. It is truly a feat that the Russo brothers were able to utilize all of the characters and not make this film feel bloated.","displayName":"Patrick P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-23T14:00:07.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-23T14:02:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"977455344","realm":"RT","displayName":"Patrick P","accountLink":"/user/id/977455344"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was as close as the comic, amazing!","displayName":"Fernando D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1657541530984945/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-23T08:28:30.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-23T08:29:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"976494105","realm":"RT","displayName":"Fernando D","accountLink":"/user/id/976494105"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 23, 2019"}]}
