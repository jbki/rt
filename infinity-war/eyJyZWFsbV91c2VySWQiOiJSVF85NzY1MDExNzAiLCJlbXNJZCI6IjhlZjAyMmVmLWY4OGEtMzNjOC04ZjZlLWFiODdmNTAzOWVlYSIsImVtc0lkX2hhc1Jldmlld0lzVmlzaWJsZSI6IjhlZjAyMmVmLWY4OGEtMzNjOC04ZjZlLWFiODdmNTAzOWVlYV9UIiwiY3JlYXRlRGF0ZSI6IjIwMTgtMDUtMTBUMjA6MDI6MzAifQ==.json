Oh man did this film grip me.  Being a diehard fan of the MCU since its infancy I have been gripped every-time a new film has came out.   Marvel has  constructed a universe that make us care about the characters and what is happening...oh yea and they made amazing films along the way with Iron man 2 (3.5 stars out of 5) as their weak point in my personal opinion.  They made us care about these characters and it all resonated and boiled into an exhilarating climax with this film.\nLet us get this out of the way.  They knocked it out of the park with this villain. They have been teasing Thanos for YEARS, and its truly a his movie, with our heroes baring the supporting role. It had to be a home run and not a single because they had  built him up as a monster figure who would wreck havoc on the galaxy.  Boy did he do all that. \n My rare perfect rating would not be possible for the casual MCU fan.  You have more than likely have had to see most of the presiding films to get the full emotional grip.\n I  also thought it all circled around fantastically.  Every character was given their fair screen time and they executed if flawlessly.  I truly thought this balance was key for the film.  This film also packed such a huge emotion punch.  I was driven to tears not because scenes were sad, but because the energy WAS THAT STRONG.  That is film making at its finest.  \nI guess I can understand criticism of the film for those who aren't really MCU fans, or haven't been that invested in previous films.  I however was so emotionally rocked that I have been thinking about this film for days (the first iron man, the first avengers, and logan are the only marvel movies to truly do this to me) \nThey topped the story off in grand fashion and have me wanting much more. Let me also say another thing.  The humor is so great.  I mean my god it had me rolling but not to the point where I diverted from the soul of the film.  That is where Marvel cannot be touched...The balance of humor humor and story.  They make you care about these people, you build relationships with these characters.  These movies have changed my life and this last film was nothing short of exceptional. I hate we have to wait a year for part 2, but there are some films to hold us over and much to talk about.  Clocking in at a swift 152 minutes, its over in the blink of an eye.  It's cliche to say \"it didn't feel that long,\" but this film really didn't feel that long!! It zoomed by as each scene had an enormous amount to offer. \nExceptional film making.","displayName":"Tyler S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-10T18:35:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-10T18:43:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"911013219","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tyler S","accountLink":"/user/id/911013219"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is what a comic book hero movie should do - what it is capable of.

And for the most part, it did not fail. Infinity War had it all. Comedy, action, emotions and all of my abortive characters for equal screen time. I would’ve like to see more destruction (especially on Earth), and the character didn’t get me super hard because I know most (if not all) of them are coming back.
