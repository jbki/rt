Avengers: Infinity War is an action-packed and emotionally wrecking. Each character (somehow) gets their moment to shine, with Robert Downey Jr., Benedict Cumberbarch and Josh Brolin stealing the show. As expected, the visual-effects are also impressive. Mainly relying on the back-up of 18 previous films, Infinity War uses its sheer energy to push this story forward leading to genuine consequences (something rare in the MCU). Its darker tone reflects the audiences investment in these characters leading to a truly heart-wrenching finale. The apocalyptic, energy and touching Avengers Infinity War lives up to the hype.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/101511620767629/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-29T08:21:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-02T07:23:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"977339106","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977339106"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"All i can say is Wow","displayName":"Vinny M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-29T07:27:54.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-29T07:28:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"977339108","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vinny M","accountLink":"/user/id/977339108"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it - a must see!!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-28T23:35:11.902Z","updateDate":"2018-06-28T23:35:11.902Z","user":{"userId":"975232114","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/975232114"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"best movie ever of all time ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-28T21:19:10.069Z","updateDate":"2018-07-05T01:13:25.475Z","user":{"userId":"976223257","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976223257"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Tiene una de las mjores escenas de acciòn (la de New York) de la saga.","displayName":"Josè M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/527450839/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-28T18:55:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-16T06:27:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"813528939","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josè M","accountLink":"/user/id/813528939"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"All the money and time that went into this film really showed, and the actors are superb.

They made the space-opera comic books of our 90s come alive and merge with the Robert Downey Jr-led Iron Man stories that we have come to adore. Not only did the storytellers manage to weave our favourite actors together - they have set up the Original Avengers cast to take their big bow in the next film by positioning them at the aftermath of the galaxy's most intense tragedy. Just proved an excellent 10 years of story-management! Nobody's done that before with so many different characters and actors!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-28T16:34:17.846Z","updateDate":"2018-06-28T16:34:17.846Z","user":{"userId":"260156687","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260156687"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Great Fun, but I´m kind of tired of superheroes movies with the same plot.
