Because of this, the movie assumes that we are already connected and up to date on all the characters, which if you are up to date makes for an action-packed movie that also has some of the most dramatic and emotional scenes in all of Marvel, if you aren't up to date it makes for a jumbled mess but in my opinion that's on you for not watching the other movies before this one. As a film this is more about Thanos than it is about the Avengers, and its all the better for it. Thanos is possibly the best Marvel villain to date with a heart-breaking backstory that can make you sympathize with him and almost see his point and yet also with all the power the battle to avengers and present more than a formidable foe","displayName":"Matthew L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-08T11:18:08.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-21T21:08:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"977310506","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew L","accountLink":"/user/id/977310506"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A movie about consequence to say the least.
