It has a few surprises, a good blending of the various characters, but it left me unsatisfied as the ending was just too abrupt.\n\nThe movie definitely centered on Thanos, and Thor and Gamorra were definitely the characters to watch in this film as their roles were very central to the movie.\n\nI am guessing that Dr. Strange's role will be key in the follow up film due out May 2019.","displayName":"Brian L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1378471020/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T08:03:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T08:09:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"888422626","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian L","accountLink":"/user/id/888422626"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I know I'm invested in many of the characters but it made me cry.

Also the fact that they killed off some characters that will come back later. So what was the point of killing them in the first place? For this I am at a even review of good and bad.

A lot of surprises and kept me on the edge of my seat. I liked that they kept some of the comedic things from Thor and Gaurdians even though this was definitely a darker marvel movie. Also it's great that finally we had a villain have an in depth backstory so we could connect with him.\n\n I know some people have said that this movie is terrible which I myself can't get. So in regards to them I would like to remind them it's a movie not reality. I mean it's for entertainment. \nI'm not a Marvel lover nor am I DC fanatic I just like superhero movies.","displayName":"Jeremy K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T07:56:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T08:07:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"977250693","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeremy K","accountLink":"/user/id/977250693"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie I have seen in theaters in 10 years.","displayName":"Sundeep K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T07:55:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T07:55:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"976925506","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sundeep K","accountLink":"/user/id/976925506"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I wasn't expecting that!
