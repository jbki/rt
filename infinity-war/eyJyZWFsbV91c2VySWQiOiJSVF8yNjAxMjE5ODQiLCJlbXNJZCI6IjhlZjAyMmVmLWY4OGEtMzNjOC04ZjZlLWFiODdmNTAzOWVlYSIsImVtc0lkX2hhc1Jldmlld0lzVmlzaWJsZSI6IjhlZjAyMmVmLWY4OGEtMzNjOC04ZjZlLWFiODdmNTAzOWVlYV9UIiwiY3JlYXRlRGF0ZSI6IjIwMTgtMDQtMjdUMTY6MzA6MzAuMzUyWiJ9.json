Let me just start off by saying there are a couple of discrepancies I have, but they are minor and I will keep them to myself. Moving on, from the beginning it just starts off at a break neck pace and doesn’t slow down really. The balance of the scenes are good in interweaving the characters as best as possible. Josh Brolin’s take on Thanos is just amazing. At times this guy sucks you in, and at the very least makes you feel empathetic towards him but at the same time is a straight raw ass savage! The relationship between him and Gamora is not one you will expect and is in a way very heart breaking. On the some of the scenes you’ve seen in the trailer are not in the film. Marvel and the Russo’s rope a doped everyone , which was a good call cuz you definitely won’t see certain things coming. The film is exhausting overall, but in a good way. Your so drained by the end of it, but what they’ve done is set up a sequel that is going to be the most epic comic book film you’ve probably ever seen.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T16:29:29.217Z","updateDate":"2018-12-14T21:56:42.161Z","user":{"userId":"260121975","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260121975"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"After thousands of hours reading comics for 29 years, it finally pays off.

Did not disappoint. A different approach to your typical superhero movie that your use to. @therussobrothers did a heck of a job making this movie. If you thought Civil War was a great Marvel mashup movie than this movie will blow you away with the screen time and interactions we see with our favorite avengers. Just look at the poster above, all of the heroes shine on screen throughout the movie. I really enjoyed Doctor Strange, Thor, and Captain America on screen in my opinion. I felt that those characters were true mvps. Thanos is a very menacing and intriguing villain. He is a Mad Titan that puts you in suspense. The soundtrack in this movie is really good, big orchestra music that tells an epic Avengers story.(There is one after credit scene you dont want to miss) @marvelstudios @disney Really did create a piece of art work that will be talked about for a long while. A movie that is like no other. Im excited to see whats to come! I want to say more but I’ll wait until my spoiler review when I go all out.
