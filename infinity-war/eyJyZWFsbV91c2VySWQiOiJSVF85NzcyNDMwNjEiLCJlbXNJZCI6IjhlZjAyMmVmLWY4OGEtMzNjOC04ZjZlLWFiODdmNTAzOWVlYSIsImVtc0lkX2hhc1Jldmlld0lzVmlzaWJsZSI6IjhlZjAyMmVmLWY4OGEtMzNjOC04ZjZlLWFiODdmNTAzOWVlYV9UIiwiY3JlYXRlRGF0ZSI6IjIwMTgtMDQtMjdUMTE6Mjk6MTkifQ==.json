This is everything I wanted in a infinity war movie. The action scenes are spectacular as the Russo brothers always do so welll on. All of the avengers were amazing (especially Thor) but some didn't get enough screen time like Bucky Barns and black panther. Thanos played by josh brolin is the best villain in the MCU by far because he's has a great back story and he's so dark and he will do anything to get all 6 infinity stones. I liked how they used the infinity stones but expect the soul stone It didn't really do anything but I like how thanos got it. The ending was shocking in a good way and that ending credit scene was very interesting. I'm very looking forward to what the Russo brothers have done with avengers 4!!!","displayName":"Joe B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T11:29:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T14:38:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"976219431","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joe B","accountLink":"/user/id/976219431"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great COMIC BOOK movie.

It is fun, but it has a surprising amount of heart and shows the benefit of Marvel's strategy of giving everyone their own movie to establish their characters before the big movie. We're able to see characters interact who are already established so the enjoyment is their interaction. It's epic and amazing in true comic book form. Most surprisingly Thanos manages to be at least a little more than just a generic giant grey baddie. Good stuff here. Without getting into spoilers there are complaints that some of the dramatic moments are undercut by the knowledge that there will be sequels for everyone so no one is any real danger. My response to that is that if you really want to get meta everyone is an actor and no one is any real danger. Just watch the movie ya wet blanket.","displayName":"Joel Z","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T11:27:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T12:14:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"973840239","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joel Z","accountLink":"/user/id/973840239"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"MCU's best movie !!!!

For some reason, I have tried to leave my review on here several times, without success. I raised my stars from 3 to 3.5 to see if I would be allowed. TWO AND A HALF HOURS!!!! Too many superheros, too many relationship issues, too many snarky comments and smirks, too much CG battle!  The last two hours move so slow, you could do your laundry and come back. If the scenes with Thanos moved any slower, they would be standing still. I'm talking painfully slow.  Just a disappointing lead-in to the next one, which I hope can redeem my feeling of being ripped-off by Infinity War.","displayName":"Chris R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T11:25:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T13:57:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"901122880","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris R","accountLink":"/user/id/901122880"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"BEST MARVEL MOVIE YET PERIOD","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T11:25:09.508Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T11:25:09.508Z","user":{"userId":"907335267","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/907335267"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Avengers Infinity War demonstrates that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has grown into a beast that Disney can no longer control.","displayName":"José P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/37525763/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T11:24:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T11:25:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"812860026","realm":"RT","displayName":"José P","accountLink":"/user/id/812860026"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"the best movie that i ever seen","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1747178525344254/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T11:24:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T11:25:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"977243053","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977243053"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"5/5.
