Kudos to Marvel for keeping the stakes formidable and not flinching from the comic storyline. It has an 'Empire Strikes Back' feel to it, which is high praise indeed. Josh Brolin is phenomenal as Thanos. If you're a fan of the Marvel movies, don't miss it and stay away from spoilers! And if possible, definitely see it in IMAX!","displayName":"Sean P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/590082695/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T23:15:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T23:28:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"893174441","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sean P","accountLink":"/user/id/893174441"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Simply the best cinematic experience!","displayName":"Poda F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T23:14:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T23:16:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247544","realm":"RT","displayName":"Poda F","accountLink":"/user/id/977247544"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The film actually lives up to the hype and feels like a true culmination of a decade's worth of marvel films. The directors somehow manage to juggle the massive cast in a way that works meshing the somewhat different tones of characters and franchises. In many ways this is a film about Thanos journey and the film often resembles lord of the rings moreso than the usual marvel film. that said there are still plenty of laughs to be had. I eagerly await to see how they move forward from this.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T23:10:41.011Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T23:10:41.011Z","user":{"userId":"260096990","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260096990"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"A polished turd is still a turd.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1757842577595740/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T23:10:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T23:11:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247538","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977247538"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I don't understand how moviemakers can be this stupid","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/595587050548174/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T23:10:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T23:10:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"976936008","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976936008"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"absolutely amazing but i can't wat for part 2","displayName":"Pingas L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T23:09:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T23:09:52.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247536","realm":"RT","displayName":"Pingas L","accountLink":"/user/id/977247536"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What a wonderful movie, kind explain in words.","displayName":"Bhavik P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T23:08:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T23:09:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247533","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bhavik P","accountLink":"/user/id/977247533"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"After years of suspense and planned buildup to this, marvel dishes it all out, and it turned out great in my opinion.
