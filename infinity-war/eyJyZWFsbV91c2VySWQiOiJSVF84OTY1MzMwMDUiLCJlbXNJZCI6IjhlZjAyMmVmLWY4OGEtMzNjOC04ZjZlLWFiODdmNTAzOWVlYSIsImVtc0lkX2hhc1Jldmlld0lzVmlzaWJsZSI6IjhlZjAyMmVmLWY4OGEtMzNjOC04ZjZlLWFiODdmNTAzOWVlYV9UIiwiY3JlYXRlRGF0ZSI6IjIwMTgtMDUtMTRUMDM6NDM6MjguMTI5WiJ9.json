It is a movie mixed of a lot of past famous heroes/characters in the old movies, spider man, iron man, dr. strange, etc., but connected them with a very insubstantial, flimsy inconvincible clue. From time to time, Director of the movie tried hard to make out no-sense, bleak, and no brainer \"funny\" lines, such as \"he is not the dude, you are the dude, and he is a man\". The epic sense, violent, brutal fighting were set just try not bore its audience... the whole movie is such a big wasting!","displayName":"Tuzi F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-13T23:28:11.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-15T11:38:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977268011","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tuzi F","accountLink":"/user/id/977268011"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"May 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is clearly a movie just for true fans of Marvel movies and just Marvel in general","displayName":"jack B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-13T23:25:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-10T16:56:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"977268009","realm":"RT","displayName":"jack B","accountLink":"/user/id/977268009"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"This lost it for me.
