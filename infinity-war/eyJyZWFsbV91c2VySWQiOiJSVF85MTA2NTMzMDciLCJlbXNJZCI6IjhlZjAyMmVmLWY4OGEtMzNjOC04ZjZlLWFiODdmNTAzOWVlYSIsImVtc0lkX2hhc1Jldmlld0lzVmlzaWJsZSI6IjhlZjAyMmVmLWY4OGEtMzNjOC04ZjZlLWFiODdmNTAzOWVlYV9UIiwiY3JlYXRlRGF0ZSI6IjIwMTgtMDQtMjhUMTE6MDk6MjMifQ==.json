Thanos was by far the best live action villain to date, and I hope this means Marvel is on a greater roll than the past 10 years.

A real treat for the building up of the mcu and a great half of a finale .action is brilliant cgi is beutiful which is something I rarely say about a lot of films the characters built up for over 10 years are great to see on screen working together and interacting and building up even more . The film however isn't with out its flaws many pacing,editing between scenes and sometimes acting feels weird and week mostly because most of the actors were not given a script just there lines so no wonder some actings a bit weird.

If your a casual viewer who just want to take your kid to a movie on the weekend for fun then this isnt your movie. This movie really requires you to have some awareness about the previous movies to fully understand and enjoy the movie. Its like watching the very last season of a show without seeing the beginning, this is no different. Not saying that its a bad movie in itself but most of the negative reviews are coming from people who are not familiar with other MCU movies which is why their not connecting with the movie. I strongly believe that this shouldn't be your first MCU movie and entry into the universe from the other 18 movies honestly this would be the worst, Instead your much better off watching Black Panther which is still in theaters for a simple superhero entertainment movie with a happy ending.","displayName":"Brian R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T10:59:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T21:16:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246069","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian R","accountLink":"/user/id/977246069"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Infinity War is entertaining. Unlike the other movies in the MCU, however, it cannot act on its own. It is a culmination of all movies to date, and its plot feels lackluster - the entire movie is a climax. There is no buildup, and it never slows down.\nThis is good if you're watching all the MCU movies in a row, but as a standalone movie, it feels like one massive fight scene, like there's no essence or story to it.","displayName":"Aurus T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T10:59:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T11:02:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246074","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aurus T","accountLink":"/user/id/977246074"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"good movie, except for the ending.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2113518545550683/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T10:59:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T11:00:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246073","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977246073"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"So after years of Marvel movies leading up to this event: Thanos and the Infinity Stones in what is a combination of all the films, the question was: Could such an ambitious feat succeed. Answer: Surprisingly yes.\n\nThere is just so much going on in this: charismatic superheroes interacting with each other again or for the first time, a lot of unexpected developments, and excellent large-scale fight scenes, special effects, and sets. I especially liked the design of Thanos' main space ships. Very unique.\n\nThis is pretty much Marvel's The Empires Strikes Back, and is by far the darkest and most mature in the franchise. Trust me, this movie will be making you feel things by the end. On the other hand, the humor and characters do balance things nicely. \n\nAs for Thanos himself, don't worry. All the waiting and teasing isn't for nought. He is, with Loki and Killmonger, one of the franchise's top villains. Josh Brolin does a wonderful job of playing the guy, both twisted and threatening, but in a calm and almost relatable manner.\n\nNot to say the film doesn't have its flaws, which is completely understandable considering that it juggled so many characters and places. Think of this as a war film, like Dunkirk, The Longest Day, or a Bridge too Far, that features various people affected by or involved in a battle. Though there are some strong moments, the cast just can't shine as brightly as they do in the solo films. Not all character relationships could have developed as much as they could and some characters you hope will meet won't. The Thor subplot also goes on too long. It could have been shortened to make way for other things.\n\nThe first quarter of the film suffered from too many close-ups shots and quick cuts, but that does seem to settle down as things goes on. Though the film did an admirable job of keeping the tone of the characters, there were moments with the Guardians of the Galaxy in which they could've cut a few jokes. Having them act moronish during certain moments did cut the tension a bit.\n\nAlso, not fond that Thanos' three regularly proportioned adopted children and lieutenants were computer animated instead of makeup like Gamora and Nebula. They just kind of stood out, and it didn't help that they weren't computer animated quite as well as their father. However, I don't agree with the complaints that they weren't well-developed. I mean, yeah they weren't, but they served their purpose as effective and distinctive threats for the heroes to fight. (You can't have all Darth Vaders. You'll always have some Boba Fett's.)\n\nNow, I can't recommend this to anyone who's not very familiar for the movie series as it'll probably leave them confused. But for all those Marvel fans out there, I feel the film delivered what it promised.","displayName":"Jack W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/20722203/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T10:58:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-17T07:39:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"788075726","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jack W","accountLink":"/user/id/788075726"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A good movie, the Russian Brothers make a good movie, dont work.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/210962922785702/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T10:57:44.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T10:58:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977082760","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977082760"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, EPIC, AND BREATH-TAKING..
