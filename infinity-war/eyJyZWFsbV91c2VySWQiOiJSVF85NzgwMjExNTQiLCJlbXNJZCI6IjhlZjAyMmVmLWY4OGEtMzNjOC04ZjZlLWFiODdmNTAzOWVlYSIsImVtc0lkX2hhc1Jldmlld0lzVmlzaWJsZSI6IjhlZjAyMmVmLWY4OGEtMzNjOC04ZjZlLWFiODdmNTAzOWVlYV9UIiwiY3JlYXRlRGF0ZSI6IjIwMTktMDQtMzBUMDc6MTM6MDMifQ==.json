It wastes no time and jumps straight into the plot because it expects the audience to already know who the characters are. Thanos is one of the best MCU villains, he is evil. He has a clear goal, that of which he thinks is good, but everyone else thinks the opposite. The minions are expendable and the audience does not get to learn about them before they die. These characters are also all pitted against mirrors of the MCU, matching powers of the villains and heroes is a great touch. The movie, while making a small amount of jokes, hit each one on the head. While the jokes are few, the witty banter between similar characters provide for wonderful interactions and introductions. The fight scenes are epic and the adventure of Thor provides from a good break away from the other two plots. Each plot has a different setting which allows for great contrast in background between blacks, oranges, and greens. Overall good action packed movie.","displayName":"Ian G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-29T11:56:45.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-29T11:56:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"977998693","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ian G","accountLink":"/user/id/977998693"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"An epic movie start to finish, the expansive Marvel universe comes crashing together with the biggest, most complex villain yet playing catalyst. So much action in one place, the heroes are fighting for their lives throughout. It is gripping but not without the flecks of humour we have come to expect from this franchise. Thoroughly enjoyable.","displayName":"Peter L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-29T06:50:41.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-29T06:50:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"978018614","realm":"RT","displayName":"Peter L","accountLink":"/user/id/978018614"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The movie is Avengers: Infinity war. He comes from Hollywood industry. He is science fiction, action movie. It's also a superhero movie. My opinion on this film is very positive because I love the Marvels, the special effects of this film really surprised me. Especially in this film I liked it because the directors did their best to make sure that each character had his moment of glory. When Thanos snaps his fingers after fighting against the Avengers and defeating them one by one and that the universe this disintegrates is the best moment of the movie because Thanos is the enemy of the Avengers and he succeeds in achieving his objective but part 2 of the movie will surely show us the continuation and the effects that this has. For me the best genre of film is science fiction because there is always an intriguing side and there is suspense, everything I like.","displayName":"French S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-29T03:21:30.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-29T03:22:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"978018004","realm":"RT","displayName":"French S","accountLink":"/user/id/978018004"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Part 1 of the epic conclusion to the marvel cinematic universe.","displayName":"Jackson G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-28T18:07:35.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-28T18:08:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"977803660","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jackson G","accountLink":"/user/id/977803660"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie its awesome to bad endgame was so dissapointed","displayName":"Oswaldo V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-28T18:03:00.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-28T18:03:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"978012728","realm":"RT","displayName":"Oswaldo V","accountLink":"/user/id/978012728"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The climax of ten years of revolutionary filmmaking, 'Infinity War' is the best possible movie it can be. A product of its own ambition, the only real fault of the film is the sheer number of characters, arcs, and many other things going on at once that make it difficult to fully appreciate how detailed and payed off McFeely and Markus' writing, as well as the Russo brothers' directing, really are. \nThough a big enough chunk of its enormous cast of thirty plus characters don't get their due, many favorites like Captain America and Black Panther included, a bigger percentage do, often even improving upon their solo movies. Doctor Strange, Iron Man (RDJ acts circles around everyone), Vision and Wanda's love story, and particularly Thor excel against the film's appropriately dark, somber tone. But it's the brilliant use of Thanos (a tip-top Josh Brolin) as the film's protagonist, along with rejuvenated motivations for the Mad Titan's spiritual quest for balance, that really seal the deal.","displayName":"Hector V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-28T12:22:40.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-28T12:22:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"977436384","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hector V","accountLink":"/user/id/977436384"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2019"}]}
