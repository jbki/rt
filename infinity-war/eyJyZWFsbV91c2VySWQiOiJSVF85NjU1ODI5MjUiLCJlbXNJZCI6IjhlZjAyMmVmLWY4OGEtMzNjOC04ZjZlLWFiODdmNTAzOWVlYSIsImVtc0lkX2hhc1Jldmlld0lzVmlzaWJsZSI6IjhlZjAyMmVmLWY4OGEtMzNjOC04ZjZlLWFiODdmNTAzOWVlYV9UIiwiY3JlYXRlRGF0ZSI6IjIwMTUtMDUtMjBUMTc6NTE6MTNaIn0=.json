So without spoiling anything, I really liked it a lot. It was a really good movie. The acting is still really good, the directing by the Russo brothers is marvelous it really is. The action sequences were done very well, and the special/visual effects were great, sometimes I was able to notice that the CGI was not working well with some parts of the movie, but most of the time it worked well. Let’s talk about Thanos, he’s great as the villain. Not only is Josh Brolin great at playing Thanos, the characters itself is just perfect. I did have some problems with this movie, but I’m not going to talk about any of those issues so I don’t spoil the movie. What I will say is that this is definitely a movie people need to check out, and I’ll probably go see this movie again and again. But afterwards, Avengers: Infinity War was a really good movie that must be seen.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2015-03-01T19:43:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-30T03:23:43.021Z","user":{"userId":"962960458","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/962960458"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 01, 2015"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"this movie was very insane, thanos is very scary, the movie made me really nervous and this is marvel studios best movie ever, i loved it so much","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2015-02-15T01:40:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T05:27:30.672Z","user":{"userId":"965418591","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/965418591"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 15, 2015"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was truly epic and I loved every minute of it, And wow that ending!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2015-02-02T00:01:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-18T12:20:09.901Z","user":{"userId":"968795152","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/968795152"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 02, 2015"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A love letter to the fans.
