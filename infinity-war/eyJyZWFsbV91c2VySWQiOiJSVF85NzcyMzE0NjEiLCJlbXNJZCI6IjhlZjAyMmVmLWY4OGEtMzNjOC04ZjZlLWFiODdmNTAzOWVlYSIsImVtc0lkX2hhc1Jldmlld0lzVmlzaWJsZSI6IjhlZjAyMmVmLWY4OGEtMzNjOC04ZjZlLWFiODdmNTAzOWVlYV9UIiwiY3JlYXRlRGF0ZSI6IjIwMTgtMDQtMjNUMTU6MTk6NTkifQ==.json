Everyone who worked behind the scenes and in front of the camera gave this movie everything they had. The Marvel Cinematic Universe went together perfectly like a puzzle being put together. This movie balances the jokes and action in a perfect manner. Avengers: Infinity War will always be a exciting experience for fans young and old.","displayName":"Dean L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-23T06:58:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-01T07:55:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"977148416","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dean L","accountLink":"/user/id/977148416"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 23, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"that was a great movie","displayName":"william o","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-23T06:48:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T15:35:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"976589024","realm":"RT","displayName":"william o","accountLink":"/user/id/976589024"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 23, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Tom Holland's performance was amazing!

It's here. I have waited for years to see this movie. And i was not disappointed. I left the theater crying, conflicted, anxious for the sequel. The fight choreography was, as expected, excellent. Right from the beginning it was a fast paced thrill ride of wonderful marvel action.\n-SPOILERS AHEAD-\n\n\n\nThis movie left me extremely sad. All my favorite characters- dead. Gone. Will they return? who knows. I never thought id leave a movie and ask my friend, so- to recap. What's the death count-. Wait, never mind. What's the living count? I was sobbing during this movie. these characters just died in front of me. disappeared... maybe forever. and i don't think I'm ready for that. I grew up with these heroes. I don't want to see them go. A friend told me that \"If a movie cant stand on its own, then its just a shameless cash grab.\" but i disagree. the point of the MCU is unity, just like the Avengers, they work together, heighten each others strengths. I think its beautiful, and cannot wait until 2019. I'm so ready.","displayName":"Andrea A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-22T16:55:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T21:32:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"977229870","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrea A","accountLink":"/user/id/977229870"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 22, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fantastic from start to finish. The ending is iconic. Thanos is the movie and is now in the pantheon of the greatest villains in movies. The story is balanced perfectly as all things should be. The action is up there as the greatest ever seen on a movie screen. It can feel a little crowded and some characters feel like they don't get their screen time but they do their best. There's time to cheer, laugh and cry in the epic that is Avengers: Infinity War. Definitely up there in the greatest movies experiences ever.","displayName":"Jake R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-22T15:56:32.000Z","updateDate":"2019-05-27T16:38:48.804Z","user":{"userId":"976920331","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jake R","accountLink":"/user/id/976920331"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 22, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Marvel movie ever.
