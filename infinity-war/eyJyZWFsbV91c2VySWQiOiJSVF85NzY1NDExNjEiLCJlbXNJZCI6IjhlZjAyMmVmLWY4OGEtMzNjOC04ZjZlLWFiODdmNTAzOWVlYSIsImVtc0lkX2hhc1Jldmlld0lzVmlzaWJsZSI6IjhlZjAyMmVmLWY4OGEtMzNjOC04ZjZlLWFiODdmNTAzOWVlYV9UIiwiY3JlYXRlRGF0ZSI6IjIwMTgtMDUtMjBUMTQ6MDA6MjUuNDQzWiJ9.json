Ultimately, like how Marvel Studios took a risk and exposed audiences to a talking raccoon and tree and made them adored by the masses, \"Infinity War\" proved to be another win for the MCU.  The story is epic in scope and exciting in nature, the Russo brothers do a tremendous job of being able to balance all the plot threads and numerous characters, the action is very satisfying, the humor is hysterical, the performances are fantastic (especially Josh Brolin as Thanos) and the movie delivers some great heart and drama.  My only complaints involve the minions of Thanos are sorta underdeveloped and I would have liked to see more of them and some scenes with Scarlet Witch and Vision are a little slow and borderline boring.  However, these two issues didn't stop me from absolutely loving this film and finding it to be something that delivered on what it promised and then went beyond that.

With large fight scenes and many things at stake, Infinity War is able to fulfill everything it was meant to be and setups a new Marvel Universe, one without Iron Man or Captain America. I would highly recommend to any superhero film.","displayName":"Liam C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-20T12:02:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-20T12:04:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"976949003","realm":"RT","displayName":"Liam C","accountLink":"/user/id/976949003"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely amazing love the action, comedy, and the sadness in this film.

Balancing plot and character development is a tricky thing, especially with as many moving parts this movie had and I feel they sacrificed the plot for the character interactions.  on't get me wrong, the interactions between the characters were good, but if they wanted me to feel like I could relate with the main villain, they failed.  Nowhere in the movie did you get to see Thanos's pain and see where he was coming from.  He was more then willing to talk about it throughout the whole movie, but talk is cheap and if you want the audience to connect with the villain, they have to see it.  Also there were some obvious plot points that were brought up in earlier Marvel movies that should have been brought forward for this movie that were not.  I made it about half-way through the movie before my suspension of disbelieving was shattered and the rest of the movie went down hill after that.  i was greatly disappointed with what i got, especially with 10 years of hype built up and I walked out of the theater wanting my money back.","displayName":"Trevor H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-20T11:13:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-20T11:22:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"975121346","realm":"RT","displayName":"Trevor H","accountLink":"/user/id/975121346"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I really liked this movie.
