I didn't get Thanos' motive for collecting the Infinity Stones and erase half the characters in the universe. Loki's death at the beginning wasn't so impactful when he died in almost every movie he was in. The beginning of the Battle of Wakanda blatantly ripped off the Gungan war in The Phantom Menace. The CGI looked fake. Why was whats-her-face... Proxima Midnight CGI if half of her face looked human and could have been make-up? When the Wakandan Warriors jumped off the skiff, I was able to tell they were CGI. And why was Hulk refusing to come out of Banner? Thor Ragnarok stated that Bruce and Hulk don't remember what eachother did, but despite being in Hulk form when Thanos arrived at the beginning, Bruce was able to warn Dr. Strange and Tony all about Thanos. And at the end, Thanos won and characters who are supposed to appear in later movies are dead like Spider-Man (the Marvel/Sony deal isn't over and Tom Holland is contracted for a Spider-Man trilogy), and the Guardians of the Galaxy except for Rocket and Nebula are dead even though there's a Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 planned. Everyone who died in this movie is expected to return in Avengers 4, so the deaths can hardly be taken seriously. Also, if you never seen a MCU movie, this is not a good place to start because you'd get so confused. I completely forgot what happened to Cap's shield, so I was wondering where it was. Wanda and Visions romance is awkward when you realize that Vision is an AI robot who has never been human. Thanos is just too OP. Seriously I found Justice League to be the better movie.","displayName":"Sean W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/974749182586692/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T12:14:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T12:50:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"972324791","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sean W","accountLink":"/user/id/972324791"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Fast paced movie that successfully navigates paying service to what came before and stands on its own.

Regardless of how many years of build up were brought to this movie, the movie itself does not disappoint. Some critics have given Infinity War a rotten score solely because there was \"too much\" of this or that.  I respectfully disagree. Going into Avengers: Infinity War, one should expect \"too much\" when all 23+ superhero characters are featured in it.  The movie is a groundbreaking success as no movie to date has ever taken so many individually built and well-developed characters and brought them together to face a common evil. Avengers: Infinity War is the movie any Marvel geek and fan has dreamt of, a must watch for the climax of the Marvel Universe, and for that, I highly recommend giving this movie a watch.","displayName":"Pun M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T12:10:52.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T12:21:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"976471977","realm":"RT","displayName":"Pun M","accountLink":"/user/id/976471977"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Avengers Infinity War sometimes feels compromised from a story perspective due to the sheer volume of characters and sub-plots vying for screen space.

Is it one of the best marvel movie ever made? - Yes, it is. Is it one of the best action movie ever made? - Yes, it is. Is it one of the biggest film ever made? - Probably it is. What a movie!! What a ride it was! There was everything. Emotion, fun, sorrow, laugh, happiness, love. There was no build of character but there was an emotional roller coaster which drive to hold your hands together. Each and every moment was written properly. But it completely feels like an incomplete film and it was. It was a two-part movie and it feels like a two-part opera. You get to dance like their puppet of desire. And it is a good thing. Thank you for this emotional funny extravaganza. We are waiting for the 4th one. One year still a long way yo go!!!

However, the more MCU movies you see, the more enjoyable this one becomes.  Having seen all 18 MCU movies prior to this one, I enjoyed this immensely.  Every character or group of characters get their moment, advance their story a bit and the ending will be talked about for years.
