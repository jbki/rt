Epic. It starts off showing us exactly what is the significance of this threat, then goes to show how each one of the many, many characters does their part to help. The ending came as a shock, and it feels very incomplete, but that's acceptable, with a sequel coming within a year. Overall, it's a thrilling ride packed with everything - Romance, heartbreak, plenty of action, some conflict, a nice, shocking ending, whatnot. It's not what I expected but it's certainly something I believe will be widely appreciated by almost all of the MCU fanbase.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/611267555915713/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T05:57:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T06:05:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"977242135","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977242135"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Its the greatest of them all....
