I loved Thanos' black circle. Each one looked wickedly cool and put up a good fight. The effects were very well done nothing really out of place. The acting was authentically marvel: flashy, comedic and a tad over reactive. And the team ups were really sick. If you are a marvel fan you'd enjoy it. If your a hater you'll find something to hate. That ending though. . . . Damngood. Can't wait to see how this plays out. 9 outta 10.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T01:52:46.138Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T01:52:46.138Z","user":{"userId":"969489189","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/969489189"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"awesome but i cried ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T01:52:27.980Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T01:52:27.980Z","user":{"userId":"260111557","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260111557"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Lives up to the hype and more!!","displayName":"Paul c","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T01:48:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T01:49:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"937929178","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paul c","accountLink":"/user/id/937929178"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie’s amazing because of the risks it takes.
