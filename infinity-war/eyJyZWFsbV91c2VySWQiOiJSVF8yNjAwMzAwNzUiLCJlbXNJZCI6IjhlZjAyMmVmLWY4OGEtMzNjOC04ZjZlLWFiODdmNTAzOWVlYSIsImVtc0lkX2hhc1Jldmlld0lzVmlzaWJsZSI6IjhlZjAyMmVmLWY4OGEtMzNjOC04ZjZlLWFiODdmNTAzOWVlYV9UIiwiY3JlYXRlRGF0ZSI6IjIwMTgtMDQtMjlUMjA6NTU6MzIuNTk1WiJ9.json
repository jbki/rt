Not one to read comics and having not much knowledge of the Marvel Universe (except for the movies), I was not prepared for this Avengers installment.\nYes, the film is 2 1/2 hours long. Did it feel like it? No. Fast paced movie, with dozens of characters to follow. Definitely the darkest Avenger movie yet. A bit of language, a great deal of violence (it's rated PG-13 for a reason), but all in all, the best Avenger movie to date. \nEven those who have read the comics are awed and (*whisper*) shocked. Marvel didn't hold anything back this time. Please, go see this movie. Well worth it to see it in IMAX, 3D, or just at the theater. Go see the movie.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/626156201067497/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T20:49:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T21:04:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249850","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977249850"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's the best Superhero movie ever......it's the combination of everything served as a delightful watch for the fans.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2130712383832149/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T20:47:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T20:48:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249845","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977249845"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Incredible movie especially when you consider what was accomplished. To have that many characters in one movie and still successfully make it engaging and coherent is a feat unto itself. Also, Thanos was amazing.

The 19th installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has finally ARRIVED! Marvel’s Avengers: Infinity War exceeds ALL expectations with MIND-BLOWING twists and turns. I’m not gonna say much of what happened in the film of course! All these theories have been thrown around on whether who lives or dies have been a trend since after Marvel’s Captain America: Civil War. The Russo Brothers made everything we all wanted in the film. Lots and LOTS character moments - ESPECIALLY, Thanos (portrayed by Josh Brolin). Thanks to the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the Russo Brothers, and Producer Kevin Feige for making this possible of having me SPEECHLESS when the credits started rolling. They’ve finally made the BEST FRIGHTENING villain in the entire MCU. Josh Brolin’s motion-capture performance was PHENOMENAL. Among the cast, they’re freakin’ AMAZING in this film. Having me believing to see the actors on screen, but bringing the characters to LIFE. There was a lot going on in this from BEGINNING-to-END! I have never laughed and cried SO MUCH until seeing this film. The BEST score in the MCU thanks to its composer Alan Silvestri and JAW-DROPPING VISUALS. 9.4/10.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T20:43:28.179Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T20:43:28.179Z","user":{"userId":"260002009","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260002009"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Great story. however broke up entertaining parts to cut between different places taking the entertainment feel good factor out of the film.
