But they did it, and they did it well.   The production quality was high, the writing was done well, and you could tell the story was well thought out.\n\nThe protagonists were likeable, the antagonist had a good backstory, and there were unexpected turns that all felt like they worked.  Aside from the casual Marvel fan who might be a little confused, this film is worth a watch.","displayName":"Chip R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-09T02:56:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-09T03:02:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"976101357","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chip R","accountLink":"/user/id/976101357"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie is an all out experience.
