Unfortunately, the Cultural Marxist turn has been more and more noticeable in Marvelâ(TM)s movies. And based on what they have said, they intend to take the next phase of the movies even further that direction. So far as Infinity War is concerned, it was a mixed bag. Where Cultural Marxism was absent, the movie was great. But where character, story, and dialogue decisions were made with an ideological bent, the movie suffered. Iâ(TM)ll enjoy the good in it, disregard the bad, and plan on saving a lot of money over the next few years, money that Marvel would have found in its pocket, had it not decided to spit on the decades of fans that have kept it afloat all these years.","displayName":"Kermit L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-02-04T18:46:47.000Z","updateDate":"2019-02-04T18:52:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"976932409","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kermit L","accountLink":"/user/id/976932409"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 04, 2019"}]}
