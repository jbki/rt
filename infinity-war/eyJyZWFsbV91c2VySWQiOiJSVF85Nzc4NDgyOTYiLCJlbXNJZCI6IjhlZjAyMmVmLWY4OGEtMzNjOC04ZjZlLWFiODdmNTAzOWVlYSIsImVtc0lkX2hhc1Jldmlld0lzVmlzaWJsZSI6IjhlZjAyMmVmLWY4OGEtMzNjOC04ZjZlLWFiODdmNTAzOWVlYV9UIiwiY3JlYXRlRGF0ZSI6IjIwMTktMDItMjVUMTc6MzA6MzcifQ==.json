I managed to throughouly entertain me and keep me on the edge of my seat for 2,5 hours despite the staggering number of storylines and characters, half of whom I had never heard of before. It told an engaging story with interesting characters and proper amount of humour used in the right way. I liked this movie a lot more than expected I would.\n\nI'm not a die-hard Marvel fan by any strecth of the imagination. I've enjoyed MCU movies in general, even though I haven't seen all of them by a long shot. I was definitely not caught up at all with the latest developments in the MCU, having missed most of the latest films. I was still able to follow and enjoy the film without being confused and all it did was make me want to watch all the films I had missed and then see this one again.","displayName":"Antti A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-02-25T02:28:24.000Z","updateDate":"2019-02-25T02:28:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"977841899","realm":"RT","displayName":"Antti A","accountLink":"/user/id/977841899"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A seriously fun time at the movies.
