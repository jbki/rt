Thanos is much more than a one dimentional thug and I think they did him very well. Some great comic relief throughout, so chalk that up to fantastic writing, timing, and delivery. Of course the effects are off the chart and are the best yet of the series. Unless you loathe super hero movies, this is huge. This doesn't just shake up the Marvel Universe snow globe, it smashes it to the ground. Going forward the francises could do almost anything. Throughly epic chapter and a must see!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T14:55:56.833Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T14:55:56.833Z","user":{"userId":"843593867","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/843593867"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"i teared up at least 3 times i was schocked 4-5 times  i was laughing my ass off 10-15 times\ni left the theater exhausted like never before,  the 149 minutes passed like a snap... jesus christ i hope the next one is as good as this one, and the ending is amazing. however i will say this,  you should watch the movies before this one to have 110% of the quality, and you should rest before watching this, it is rly exhausting","displayName":"Nikolas D.

This film manages to juggle a vast array of characters and flesh out a villain only previously teases. The humor is kept, but the seriousness is also escalated. This film also manages to not feel like only setup for a second part, but as a full piece which could stand on its own. It gives nods to the comics and the larger universe, but not get the average moviegoer too lost. It definitely builds beautifully on all the films that precede it.","displayName":"Lucas Q","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T14:53:19.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-14T00:30:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"912049672","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lucas Q","accountLink":"/user/id/912049672"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Easily the best Avengers outing yet.

Considering the volume of material available to make this film, and having to take all of that and work it into a film that most people can appreciate without knowing the full back story, or having read the multiple comics and graphic novels at its root, a round of applause! The Infinity series is one of, if not the best, writing Marvel has ever produced. Well, that or Annihilation. Navigating that whole series of plots and subplots and turning it into what ended up on the screen, from the first movie to this one, successfully, again, great job! The theater was chaotic during some of the scenes. perfect movie for a Saturday afternoon.","displayName":"Tim P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T14:48:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T14:48:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"908287787","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tim P","accountLink":"/user/id/908287787"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is going to be the best movie ever for now Iâ€™ve seen every MCU movie there is","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T14:48:08.118Z","updateDate":"2018-08-04T17:38:17.827Z","user":{"userId":"260117725","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260117725"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"In my opinion this is the greatest superhero movie of all time and nothing will match the awe of seeing this movie for the first time.
