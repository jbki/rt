The past 2 have told complete stories which set up to where you can watch more in the series. This does the opposite of that. You HAVE to see another few movies to get the complete story and know what the heck is going on. Here is my non-spoiler review of Avengers: Infinity War.\n\n12/15 points go to the ACTING category. All of your original cast members from the Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers film are great. Elizabeth Olsen drops the accent, which takes away from the character. Josh Brolin, who plays Thanos, is amazing. His motion capture work is mostly amazing. We can really see the character as a good character. The Black Order cast is also great. They also give stunning motion capture work.\n\n10/15 points go to the WRITING category. The story is written as a small story, and is only half or less of a story. We don't see anything really happen except some character changes and some news that characters won't be in the next film. There are also many plot holes, and just about no permanent character deaths except for the first on-screen 2. They literally have confirmed that none of the deaths are permanent by their release schedule. \n8/10 points go to the VISUAL EFFECTS category. The effects for motion capture are amazing, but Thanos is the problem. He sometimes looks incredibly fake, mainly in the scene where he is swimming after getting a new Infinity Stone.The rest is amazing.\n\n7/10 points go to the CHARACTERS category. The characters are annoying, and the people in the Wakanda scenes are boring. They are just filler. There is only one scene with them where they are useful, which is the Wakanda battle. Tony Stark/Iron Man is unlikable. Dr. Strange is a bit on an idiot. War Machine and Falcon are wasted. The basic Marvel film stuff.\n\n2/5 points go to the DEVELOPMENT category. Barely anything happens besides we see Thanos being developed. Barely anything else happens throughout besides a character getting a new weapon and some battles.\n\n2/5 points go to the ORIGINAL MUSIC SCORE category. There are 2 points provided for each song listed for the film in the credits. These are the Avengers and Black Panther themes, but there's more, but that's all they listed. Only if they said there were more.\n\n10/10 points go to the DIRECTION category. The Russo Brothers did amazing with doing this film. We can see a clear sense of their direction written on the film. We don't see everything falling out of line at all throughout the film.\n\n8/10 points go to the VISION AND SOUND QUALITY category. Don't get me wrong, this film looks and sounds amazing. You can see it on any screen and enjoy it, but it was filmed in IMAX, so you won't see everything without the IMAX ticket, which is frustrating. There are also times where it sounds like just noise near during the Wakandan battle.\n\n16/20 points go to the MY OVERALL CONSENSUS category. While having great direction and choreography, Infinity War messes up in a few major places. \n\nOverall Score: 83%\n\nGrade: B-","displayName":"Reviews F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-21T16:14:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-06T15:45:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"977220744","realm":"RT","displayName":"Reviews F","accountLink":"/user/id/977220744"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 21, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Everything I expected and more.
