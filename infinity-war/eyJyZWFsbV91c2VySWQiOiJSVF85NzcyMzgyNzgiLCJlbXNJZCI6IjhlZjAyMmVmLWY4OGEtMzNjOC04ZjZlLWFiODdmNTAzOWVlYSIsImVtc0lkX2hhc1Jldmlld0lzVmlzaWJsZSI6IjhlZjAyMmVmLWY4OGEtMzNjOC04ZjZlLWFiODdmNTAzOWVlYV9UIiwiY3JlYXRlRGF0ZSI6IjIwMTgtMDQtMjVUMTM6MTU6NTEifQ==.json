The Avengers give a fantastic performance, especially Iron Man, Thor, Gamora, Spider-Man and Doctor Strange. The movie has a great plot and is differently structured than other Marvel movies. It benefits from choosing Thanos as it's primary character. The fight scenes are some of Marvel's best. Silvestri's score is nostalgic and a thing of beauty. The cinematography. The whole movie is unbelievably tense since the stakes are so high. Just in terms of sheer achievement, the movie is astounding. The Russos have once again proved themselves","displayName":"Siddhant P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T12:50:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T01:17:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"976632936","realm":"RT","displayName":"Siddhant P","accountLink":"/user/id/976632936"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is unbelievably exceptional. It's very thrilling and it is full of twists that the audiences will o  be expecting. I honestly recommend this movie to any superhero comic book loving fan. Rotten Tomatoes' score is inaccurate because this movie is brilliant. Thanos definitely lives up to the hype! He's a lot better than Killmonger who people say is as good or better than Heath Ledger's Joker, which is complete crap by the way.","displayName":"Bailey M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/411760732533038/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T12:48:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T15:19:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"976256351","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bailey M","accountLink":"/user/id/976256351"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"omg!..epic movie, overwelming action at every corner! the trailer for the Green Lantern corp is awesome!","displayName":"Rod W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-25T12:33:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-25T12:33:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"964455607","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rod W","accountLink":"/user/id/964455607"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It’s a 5 you are going to be shook to your core i have been this involved in a film since I saw Star Wars for the first time.

The cast had a lot of nice banter. The humor didn’t override the drama like it did in Ultron. The stakes felt real. The action from the Russo brothers is excellent. It’s really hard to write this review without spoiling anything. The ending is excellent. Overall, this review is very short. See this movie. It has everything and more that you want in a Marvel movie. I know it sound like I’m a Marvel fanboy, but I promise I just loved this movie. Go check this out.
