Overflowing with action, excellent special effects and cgi, all I can say is I really want to see it again.\nThe only negative to the Avengers saga, in my opinion, is that there seems to be just too many superhero's to keep track of.  There a a couple that I still don't know their names.\nPlus, Infinity Wars does end leaving a HUGE cliffhanger that leaves us all foaming at the mouth for the next one.\nGrab the popcorn, get a soda and settle in for a rocking 2 1/2 hours that will leave you speechless.","displayName":"Jim F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000501833228/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T15:45:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T15:58:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"894053528","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jim F","accountLink":"/user/id/894053528"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Infinity War is as amazing as we all hoped for :)","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10204061323290500/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T15:44:31.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T15:52:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246670","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977246670"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This film Blew my MIND INTO PIECES, I FELT EXCITED, SAD AND MOST IMPORTANTLY....SHOCKED!!!","displayName":"Dabi B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T15:44:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T15:46:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246669","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dabi B","accountLink":"/user/id/977246669"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Considering the task the Russo brothers faced,this was a near perfect movie,an incredible juggling act with well timed humour and powerful emotional beats.Thanos is the best villain since Heath Ledgers joker and easily the best in the MCU.","displayName":"Glen C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1640989139562198/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T15:43:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T15:51:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"974862846","realm":"RT","displayName":"Glen C","accountLink":"/user/id/974862846"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best movies I've ever seen, everything you thought was going to happen had a completely different outcome.

Truely a Marvel. The story was great the chracters were great and of course thanos was great. Marvel did a amzaing job at keeping spoilers with their trailer by editing out some parts ir editing special things in. The movie contained sone MAJOR plot twists and reveals. A sat the intire 2/5 ours at the edge of my seat. The soundtracj was one to never forget. I listen to it almost every day while working. If you consider going yo this movie. I definately recommend it. Its great for Marvel fans and even DC fans are going to like it.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/520578995010262/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T15:40:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T15:46:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246661","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977246661"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A pulse pounding super hero film, with all the rollercoaster of emotions that you would expect from a film like this.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/715673825137350/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T15:40:33.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T15:43:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"977246660","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977246660"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Good movie but ... not a movie I want to see again!","displayName":"Ricci R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T15:40:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T15:41:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"905772319","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ricci R","accountLink":"/user/id/905772319"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
