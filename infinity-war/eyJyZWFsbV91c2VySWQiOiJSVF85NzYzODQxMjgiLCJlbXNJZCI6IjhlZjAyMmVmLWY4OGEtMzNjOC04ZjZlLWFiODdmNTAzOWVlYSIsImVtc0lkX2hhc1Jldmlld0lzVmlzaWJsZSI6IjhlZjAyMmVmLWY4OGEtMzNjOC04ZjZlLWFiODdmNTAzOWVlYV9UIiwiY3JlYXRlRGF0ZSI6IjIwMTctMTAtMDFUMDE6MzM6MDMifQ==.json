I'm not sure about funny quotes as the action was far more better and the greatest avengers of them all is my favorite who is Thor. the ending was good, but it didn't leave you hanging on to wanting to watch the last one which is the 4th installment. the hidden scene at the end of the movie is good, tho for sure this will be interesting as how this one female superhero will come to play as her solo movie comes out first. I sure do want to see how much more action against Thanos will be in the last installment and which superheroes will be in fighting mode and of course lastly be waiting for the most famous person to appear once again and that's the great Stan Lee as he's always knows how to make an entrance and say the best lines in his cameos.

Josh Brolin was fantastic as Thanos!  And it have a good balance between comedy and tragedy.  But they did put unnecessary comedy in dark moments.

Honestly, I think there should have been less characters. I love Marvelâ€™s character building moments, but there werenâ€™t many of those moments in this film. The only real character-building scene was the part where Thanos gets the soul stone. That is the only part of the film where I felt truly connected to any of the characters. Needless to say that this was still a very enjoyable film.

It was much different than any other Marvel film we have seen with a darker tone which makes this film very unique from the rest.
