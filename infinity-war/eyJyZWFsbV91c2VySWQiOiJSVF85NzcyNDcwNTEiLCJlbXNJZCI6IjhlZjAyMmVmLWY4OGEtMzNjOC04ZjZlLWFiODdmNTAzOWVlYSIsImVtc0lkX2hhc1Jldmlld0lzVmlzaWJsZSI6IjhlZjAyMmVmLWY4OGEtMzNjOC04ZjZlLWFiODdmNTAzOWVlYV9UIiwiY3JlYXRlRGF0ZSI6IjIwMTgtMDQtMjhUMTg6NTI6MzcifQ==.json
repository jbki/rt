I was expecting more fight from the heroes as some left me scratchingy head. It's almost as if you wanted the dark side to prevail which was weird. I still think Spiderman sucks in this as well. The ending was some shock value. This one was a flat line for me....not all fantastic and not all bad either. Go check it out though.. I am sure it's more to this puzzle. #KIRR #AVENGERS #INFINITYWAR #ABITDUSTY #HMMM","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T18:52:36.853Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T18:52:46.655Z","user":{"userId":"922610748","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/922610748"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I went into this movie with big expectations....and it delivered!  thanos is the best villain yet in the mcu.  not only does he demonstrate the ability to physically challenge our heroes but the movie also gives ample screen time to flesh out his convictions and strong will to not give up on his intentions, no matter the cost.  I only have two gripes about the movie...  and they are totally forgivable:  1) I felt like there was a little to much humor.  it was good 90% of the time but felt shoehorned in in a few places where it wasnt needed IMO.  2) I wish we had gotten some description of thanos's henchmen.  it didnt hurt the movie by not explaining them, but unless you are nerdy enough to care and go look them all up to understand THEIR powers, it just inexplicable eye candy when they fight with our heroes.  even if there was just a simple explanation by gamora maybe giving a quick rundown of their names and abilities when shes telling thor about thanos...  or even if Bruce could mention stuff to Tony and Strange when he landed all freaked out.  other than those 2 minor things, I think this movie really knocked it out of the park!  I was amazed to find out afterwards how long the movie was.  it was good enough that it really kept my interest the entire time and I didnt notice the long runtime.","displayName":"Erik V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T18:52:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T16:07:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"911107072","realm":"RT","displayName":"Erik V","accountLink":"/user/id/911107072"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"An absolute chore to watch.

This movie is extremely well executed. Great plot, story, script. The actors are terrific. It has a great pace, and the job it does of linking the story lines through time is remarkable. \n\nIt also shares something that most super hero movies cannot do. It truly has some surprises and zigs whennyou think it will zag. My ninth grade daughter, who absolutely loves everything Marvel, loved the movie. She bought in 100%. The film has action, the right level of comedy and above all; HEART and EMOTION. \n\nI'm not a spoiler, but I for one can't wait to see the next chapter, and I hope this team can keep this mojo that they have kept going for 10 years now. \n\nIncredible movie on its own. \nThe MCU is the biggest, most ambitious and thoroughly entertaining cinematic experiences in theatrical history. We are watching something that I doubt will ever come again. So enjoy it.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/158003635037339/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T18:45:22.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T19:03:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"977247033","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977247033"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Epic!!!
