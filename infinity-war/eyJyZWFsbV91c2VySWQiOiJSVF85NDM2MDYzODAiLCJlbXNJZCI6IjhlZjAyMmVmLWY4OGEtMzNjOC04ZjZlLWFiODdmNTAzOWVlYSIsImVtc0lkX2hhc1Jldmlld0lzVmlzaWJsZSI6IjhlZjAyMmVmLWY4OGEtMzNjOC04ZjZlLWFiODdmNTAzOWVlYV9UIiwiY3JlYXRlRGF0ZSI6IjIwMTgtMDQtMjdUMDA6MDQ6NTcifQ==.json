I enjoyed this one quite a bit. After being pretty disappointed in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) I came into this one casually optimistic since the last decade of movies starting with Iron man (2008) has lead to this epic fight with the mad titan himself Thanos (Josh Brolin). I'm not going to spoil anything in this review and from the look of it everyone's going to see it. The story takes place immediately after the events of Thor Ragnarok (2017). Thanos and his \"children\" are hunting down the infinity stones and it's up to the Avengers and a few new friends to stop him. The action is great here with some really epic pieces. The story is a bit darker than the last few movies and I liked that it gives off a sort of Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back (1980) kind of feel to it all. Overall, solid film that makes me very excited to see what direction Marvel will take the films next.","displayName":"James R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T00:04:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-03T11:41:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"868770479","realm":"RT","displayName":"James R","accountLink":"/user/id/868770479"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good movie all the time","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1713755622025300/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T00:03:17.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T00:03:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241391","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977241391"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Blockbuster movie of all time !!","displayName":"Sahil R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T00:01:10.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T00:02:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241385","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sahil R","accountLink":"/user/id/977241385"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Was a fun movie.

AVOID ALL SPOILER AT ALL COSTS. Really though, it's not anything like any Marvel movie before it, and is probably unlike any that will come after it. Just when you thought that Marvel had become a simple copy and paste movie making company they make a movie like this. SERIOUSLY, WATCH IT.","displayName":"Caleb D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T23:59:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T00:04:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"977241384","realm":"RT","displayName":"Caleb D","accountLink":"/user/id/977241384"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The Russo's weaved together an incredible tapestry of different storylines, characters and motivations all into one master epic. Thanos is the most menacing, sympathetic and genocidal villain of all time. Brolin deserves a ton of credit for bringing such a spectacular villain to the big screen. RDJ, Tom Holland, Pratt, Bettany, Gamora and Ruffalo were all particularly outstanding. Grateful for such a wonderful cinematic experience and cannot wait for the sequel.","displayName":"James E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T23:57:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T00:01:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"911136661","realm":"RT","displayName":"James E","accountLink":"/user/id/911136661"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great movie.... amazing ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-26T23:57:16.950Z","updateDate":"2018-05-10T20:43:22.591Z","user":{"userId":"913700259","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/913700259"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 26, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Probably the Best Movie I have ever seen.
