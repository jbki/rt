And even though the story is very bleak and involves the good guys taking numerous beatdowns, there is still a lot of good humor and good dialogue and character development. Why this movie has a Rotten Tomatoes aggregate of 84 while the Last Jedi was up in the 90s and was getting heaps of praise from almost every critic, just doesn't make sense. This movie is darker and much more bleak than The Last Jedi, but so much more enjoyable than The Last Jedi. The Last Jedi had uninteresting characters, uninteresting plot twists, bad dialogue, etc, etc. This movie, Infinity Wars, in comparison, offers such a much more exhilarating and interesting and exciting ride!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T02:11:07.392Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T02:11:07.392Z","user":{"userId":"260020924","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260020924"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Thanos is an idiot? Movie too long? Doesnâ€™t make sense? Critic reviews are amusing. itâ€™s actually very well put together, extremely entertaining and pulls itself off very well despite a moment or two that will gave you questioning character choices. The change in Thanosâ€™ motives from the comics adds sympathy you would not feel otherwise, but has me regretting the loss of connection to Deadpool.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T02:04:01.267Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T02:04:11.748Z","user":{"userId":"963267361","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/963267361"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing and intense.
