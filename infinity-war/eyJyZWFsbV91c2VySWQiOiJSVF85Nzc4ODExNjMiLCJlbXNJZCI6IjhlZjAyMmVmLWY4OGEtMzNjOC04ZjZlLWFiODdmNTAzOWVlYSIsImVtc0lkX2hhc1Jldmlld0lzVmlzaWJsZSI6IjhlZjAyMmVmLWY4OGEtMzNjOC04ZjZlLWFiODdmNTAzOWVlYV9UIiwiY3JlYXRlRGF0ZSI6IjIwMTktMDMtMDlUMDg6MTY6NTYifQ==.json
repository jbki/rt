In an age where huge, extremely high budget, high CGI movies are common, this managed to feel truly epic. \n\nOnly reason I can't give it a 5/5 is that it depends too much on the movies that came before it.

Before seeing this movie, Winter Soldier was my favorite MCU film. The Russo's are by far the best thing to happen to the MCU. The characters, the pacing, the action....everything was on point in this film. Thanos by far the best MCU villian to date! And it will be hard for the MCU to match that success unfortunately. I rarely watch a movie more than 3 times anymore, but I've already watched this one 10 times in the past year. Can't get enough of it.","displayName":"Matt L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-09T06:48:25.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-09T06:53:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"977603959","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt L","accountLink":"/user/id/977603959"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie.

The first and only film I've ever seen 5x at the cinemas.  Also the most rewatched film period in all of MCU pantheon of films.  Most favourite has to be IronStrangeSpider scenes but there's not a single scene that is not rewatchable.  It took over 5x to even process the dusting.  It was a visceral kick that has not yet been duplicated.  Sooooo looking forward to Endgame.
