The best Marvel Cinematic Universe film yet! The way all of the characters and story lines that have been building up to this for a decade were weaved together was pretty amazing and beautiful to behold. Watching this movie was like watching history. No one has ever attempted or achieved such a long cinematic story arch with such precise and thoughtful execution. Kudos Marvel. Star Wars, Star Trek, and Harry Potter may be my franchises of choice, but Marvel is up there and has achieved something pretty amazing these last 10 years and deserves respect. I'll just end by saying one more thing about this movie. Wow! Just...WOW!","displayName":"Dan M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/44806477/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-01-27T16:29:03.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T18:24:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"781789258","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dan M","accountLink":"/user/id/781789258"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's definitely a movie that rewrites the history of box office ?!~","displayName":"Zhonghua Z","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-01-25T22:00:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-03-09T14:35:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"968132559","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zhonghua Z","accountLink":"/user/id/968132559"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Whoa okay, so as hyped as I was, I couldn't help but feel like this could turn out to be a big dud, like it was too ambitious of a project. That let's see, all the Avengers (Minus Hawkeye), plus the Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man, Black Panther, Doctor Strange. Winter Soldier (Apparently he's called White Wolf now). with so many characters, the film would feel to incoherent  \n Now the movies only real flaw, I would not recommend seeing it unless you do follow the entire MCU, if you're a fan of a handful of characters (Like someone I know really just likes Iron Man and Thor, and the Guardians) you may feel lost or be disappointed the character you are a fan of doesn't have as much screentime, or doesn't have more. \n But for what it is and how many characters are in the film, the Russo brothers did a fantastic job. \n Infinity War has all the action and humor we've come to expect and enjoy from the MCU, but is also hands down the darkest film in the franchise yet. What really sets this apart from the others is Thanos, most MCU villains (The exceptions being Loki, the Vulture, and Killmonger) are nothing special. But what makes Thanos so interesting is the fact he feels he is the hero of the story, and he's doing what needs to be done to save the entire universe. \n  Worth the watch, recommend it","displayName":"Jesse C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001413172515/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-01-21T17:30:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-13T17:58:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"905615374","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jesse C","accountLink":"/user/id/905615374"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 21, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This brings a new direction for the MCU, there are lots of heroes which brings more comic relief since there are many comic relief characters , the characters interacting to different characters' relationship blends in and brings a lot of heart to the audience, and of course the story and plot are simple and the best part about it is the changing of action sequences, there action scenes look equally balanced because of the great amount of teamwork carried by each character,the flaw about this film is the unnecessary and rushed editing of action sequences to continued scenes, it makes the scenes look incomplete and discontinued.","displayName":"The Ragin K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-01-20T05:52:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-22T18:56:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"977064035","realm":"RT","displayName":"The Ragin K","accountLink":"/user/id/977064035"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Not the best movie ever but I enjoyed the humor and was never bored.

It \"perfectly balances\" all the scenes and arrays of so many characters and keeps on getting better and better as it went on. The action/special effects work and scenes are outstanding and impressive, perhaps more than any other movie I have ever seen. I have never been so on the edge of my seat in a movie before. The big surprises and moments kept on coming, and got increasingly complex. Totally unexpected things happen too!!
