I can only imagine how hard would it be to go to this movie and have not been in the Marvel train for at least 5 to 6 years, but it is also quite fulfilling for those who were on this immense journey, to be presented with this prize, this incredible milestone that is Infinity War. It is this bookend for a plethora of characters and stories, told many different people, and now culminates in a massive conclusion. This is not a carbon copy of the comics, neither it is an attempt to be. It is another tale of Thanos, the Avengers, the Infinity Stones, and the fate of half of the universe. This movie does not hold the hands of newcomers, and it doesn't have to. This is the award for the commitment of the filmmakers, the actors, and those who followed this journey. I loved it, it makes me happy as a movie lover, a comics reader, and as a person.","displayName":"Gyorgy N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1437914976/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-11T02:46:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-11T02:57:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"960469970","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gyorgy N","accountLink":"/user/id/960469970"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"could have started better but overall a solid film","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-11T02:44:19.429Z","updateDate":"2018-05-11T02:44:19.429Z","user":{"userId":"260083685","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260083685"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"NOT gonna lie but there wasn't really a storyline here it was fight scene after fight scen there were some really funny parts I loved the parts between the guardians of the galaxy and Thor it was the perfect fit but the ending was SHIT I NEVER HATED AN ENDING MORE I ALMOST STARTED CRYING","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/813469092185750/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-11T01:19:47.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-11T01:21:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977264278","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977264278"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Beautiful, breathtaking, a masterpiece in every sense.
