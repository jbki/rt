This movie took a HUGE risk and won. Doing a crossover on this scale has never been done before. Somehow the Russo brothers managed to bring in 100079754 super heroes and still make the movie feel personal. Almost every character had their moment and mattered in the film. Getting to see different heroes use their powers and work together in combinations was really cool. Props 2. Thanos is the best Marvel bad guy of all time. Josh Brolin was perfect for this role. Marvel hasn’t been great at giving us compelling bad guys.... but they nailed it this time. I’m putting him in “Heath Ledger Joker” territory. 3. I laughed a lot. The humor was very well done throughout and carried a Thor Ragnarok vibe that worked. I was surprised that I laughed so much in a movie that was sooooo heavy. 4. This movie was sooooooo heavy. The stakes are real throughout and they’re high. For the first time ever in a Marvel movie we experience real losses/consequences. I’m not gonna lie..... I may have cried(just a little at the end). 5. The ending was stunning. You’re not ready for the ending of this movie. It’s a punch to the gut that sends any good nerd into a fan theory frenzy. We’ll be talking about this a lot till next year’s Avengers movie. What I Didn’t Love 1. The black order were...... meh Thanos’ children were weak sauce IMO. I know it had to be really tough to ad anyone new into this movie, but I wasn’t impressed. 2. Baby Groot > Adult Groot > Teen Groot 3. I don’t like how the MCU has demoted Vision’s powers. For a being that single handedly vanquished Ultron and a being worthy of holding Thor’s hammer.... he sure doesn’t do much.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T12:56:36.984Z","updateDate":"2018-06-30T04:45:16.522Z","user":{"userId":"800992756","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/800992756"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It actually happened.

To me, it was satisfying and nice movie, but I have a feeling it could have been even better. Here's my review:\n\nFirst I'll take down my issues with this one:\n\nThis movie had a hard task before it: making a good movie with many characters and plotlines in it instead making a mess. The movie did good job doing that but still I have a feeling it could have been done much better. Many plotlines sometimes feel pointless and you just want to skip over certain scenes and I hope that the same execution which worked in certain scenes would have been done in other scenes as well. \nMy another issue is very minor one but sometimes it feels that certain characters do things that they wouldn't normally do just to promote the plot.\n\nAnd now that I have covered my issues, let's get to the pros:\n\nAs I earlier said, the plotlines of the movie didn't always hold up but characters and their development is just amazing. Most of characters are made much deeper personas that are easier relate to, including the main villain of the movie, who instead of being just a mindless conquerer is a real person with feelings and ideals. \nSecond plus is the humor of this movie. I think it's clever, funny and not very often out of place and it also doesn't undercut the drama scenes, that is a common problem with many Marvel movies nowdays\nThird and last thing is, as I earlier hinted, execution of certain scenes. I think that some of the scenes are Marvelous (see what I did there) and the acting and execution is just simply great\n\nSo, here's my review. Hope you enjoyed reading it!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/152973705487847/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T12:48:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T12:48:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"977060833","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977060833"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome movie !!

However, as a standalone film it's really quite pointless. It's 2 and half hours of a 10 minute narrative, almost of which will be undone in the next installment. I'm knocking this film because if the same standards that were applied to DC's films were applied to Infinity War, critics and viewers alike would hold it up for ridicule. There are plenty of plot holes but most fans are going to ignore them. This is a must-see for comic book fans but, as a film, there's nothing revolutionary or remarkable about it.","displayName":"Cameron S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/606291004/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-02T11:51:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-02T11:56:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"795837238","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cameron S","accountLink":"/user/id/795837238"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 02, 2018"}]}
