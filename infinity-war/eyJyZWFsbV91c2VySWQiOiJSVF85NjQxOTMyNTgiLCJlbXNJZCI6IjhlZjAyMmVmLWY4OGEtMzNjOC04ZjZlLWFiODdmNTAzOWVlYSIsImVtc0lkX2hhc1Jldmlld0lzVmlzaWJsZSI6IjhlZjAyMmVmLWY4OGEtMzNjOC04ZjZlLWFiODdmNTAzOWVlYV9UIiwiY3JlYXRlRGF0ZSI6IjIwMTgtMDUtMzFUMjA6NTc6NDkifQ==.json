Even though it was only 4 years, it seemed like an eternity.\nWords cannot express how thoroughly my expectations were met and exceeded.\nFrom the moment that the Marvel logo appeared without the normal intro music and replaced with the haunting plea from the Asgardian ship to halt fire from Thanos and the Black Order, it was apparent this was something special.  \nEvery action sequence, every meeting of Avenger and Guardian was pitch perfect in tone, humor and magnitude.  Very little seemed forced.  Barbs being traded between Iron Man and Doctor Strange; Thor and Star Lord and Captain America and Groot were memorable, remarkable, yet realistic.  \nThe star of the movie for me was the antagonist, Thanos.  For someone that wanted to wipe out half of the universe, he seemed to have a certain respect and understanding for those that opposed him.  Not to mention the fact that the movie did not follow the comic book Thanos' reasoning for obtaining the Gauntlet and Infinity Stones.\nBetween each death, reveal and in some cases return, coupled with the humor, it seemed almost impossible that more than 2 and 1/2 hours went by between that haunting opening and the pager being dropped in the after-credits scene.\nThe roller coaster of emotions that the movie bought on put it in a class of entertainment that could only be compared to sporting events for me: I felt drained walking out of the theater after the first viewing.\nEven on subsequent viewings, even knowing what is going to happen and when, I am still amazed, angry and amused with what happened.\nIs it May 3, 2019 yet?","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2179952792224014/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-31T18:32:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-31T19:02:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"977300767","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977300767"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 31, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This was one epic movie that will give you all the action sequences that fans come to see.

Very big MCU fan and I waited years for this movie to hit theaters and I was blown away. This is the best MCU movie you will ever see, without a doubt. Starts off fast and with a bang! Gets right to the point and held my attention for the whole movie. Very good ending, definitely in need of a second part. The best part of this movie was Thanos (The villain), Josh Brolin is a GENIUS and played him perfectly. At some points in the movie (personal opinion) you even felt sorry for him and that's what makes him an amazing villain and probably the best villain to date.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/388029631714854/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-31T17:34:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-31T17:43:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"977300724","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977300724"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 31, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Not sure where to begin with reviewing this juggernaut of a movie.
