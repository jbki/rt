The pacing, characters, action, story, and villain were all amazing.

The opening scene of murder. torture and futility of struggle set the tone for the entire picture meaning any humour falls between the cracks. Special mention of the ridiculousness of the set piece scene in which superheroes with the ability to single handedly level entire cities resort to charging across a battlefield in lord of the rings style hand to hand combat.
