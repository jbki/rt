Full of jokes, because otherwise, you'd be too depressed to watch this thing for 2 1/2 hours.\n\nThe kind of fanboy who would give this movie five stars is the kind who would set fire to his action figures because he thought that was cool. Really, they should have called this film \"Avengers: F*** You.\"\n\nIf I had an Infinity Gauntlet, I'd find a way to give this film zero stars.","displayName":"Alan C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T21:09:16.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T21:39:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"976950301","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alan C","accountLink":"/user/id/976950301"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I am both a fan of DC and Marvel but this was hands-down a freaking masterpiece.

I choked up more during this than during any other Marvel movie. Higher stakes and loss equals more emotion. Tons of action. Cliffhanger at the end leaves you wondering what's next.

I still feel like there were some missed opportunities, but the job the Russos did of juggling this many characters and keeping it this good is quite a feat.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-27T21:03:16.165Z","updateDate":"2018-04-27T21:03:16.165Z","user":{"userId":"941333840","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/941333840"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great fun. 2 1/2 hours flew by.
