The whole movie happened in 30 minutes, 15 minutes in the beginning and 15 minutes at the end...with two hours of effects, corny jokes, predictable drama, predictable fight scenes and every action movie cliche in the book.  I am an action movie junkie and I love sci-fi and big Hollywood productions, I was HIGHLY disappointed at the profound lack of imagination and paint by numbers script. If you are that curious, wait until it hits DVD and rent it.
