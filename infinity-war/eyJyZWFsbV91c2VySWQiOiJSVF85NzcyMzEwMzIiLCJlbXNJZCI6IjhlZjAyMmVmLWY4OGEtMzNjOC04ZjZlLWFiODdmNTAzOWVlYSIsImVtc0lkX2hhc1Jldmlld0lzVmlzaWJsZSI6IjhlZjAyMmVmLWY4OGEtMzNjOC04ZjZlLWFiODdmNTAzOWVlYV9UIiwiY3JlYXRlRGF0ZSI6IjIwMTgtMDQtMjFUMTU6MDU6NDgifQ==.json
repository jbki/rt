Yes it totally does live up to the hype and exceeds all expectations. In no way is Infinity war a perfect film as much as I wanted it to be but it is extremely ambitious and one of the best the MCU has to offer.\n\nAvengers Infinity war finally gives us what we've waiting for so long, one massive event which brings all our favorite characters together fighting against the big bad Thanos. Thanos is finally here and he truly is spectacular but more on him later.\n\nLet's begin with the fact that this film is super ambitious. To fit dozens of characters and several plot-lines into one cohesive two and a half hour film is no easy task but the Russo's have done it. The film feels grand andEpic. The film could've suffered from pacing issues what with all the characters and several things happening in different locations but it never feels rushed or slow but just right. The visual effects are spot on especially when it comes to creating elaborate fight sequences and realistic looking characters like Thanos and his children who are all computer generated.\n\nAlmost all the characters that we know and love are in this film and its quite awesome to see them interact. Watching characters that have never met each other before finally meet and fight together was like a dream come true. The banter between the heroes is well written and the chemistry between the characters is just perfect. The movie explored Doctor strange's powers a lot more which was fantastic but failed to do the same with Scarlett Witch as she does the same stuff she's been doing ever since Age of Ultron. Several characters get their jaw dropping goosebumps inducing moments that made the audience go crazy. Characters that stood out in this film for me would be Doctor Strange, Thor, Iron man and of course Thanos.\n\nBefore I get into Thanos I would like to address one of the gripes I had and that is the children of Thanos, Korvus Glaive, Proxima midnight, Cull obsidian and Ebony Maw. These four looked great but there was nothing much under the surface. They were just mini bosses the heroes had to fight before Thanos. But for the most part I can forgive that because of Thanos is the best MCU villain ever. Thanos is great at beating the crap out of everyone but he was also a villain I could empathize with. He had compelling motivations and a lot of character depth. What's great about Thanos is that he isn't just a large strong guy but a character you can care about. Josh Brolin is perfect as Thanos and I can't think of anyone who could have done it better. \n\nThe fight sequences are well balanced with each character getting their time to shine. Creating a long and elaborate fight scene with multiple characters takes a lot of planning and hard work but the Russo's have done it well before and they did it even better this time. The comedy is present and for the most part is handled properly but sometimes they do manage to ruin serious moments with jokes that don't always work.\n\nAvengers Infinity War is a near masterpiece that has it all. From spectacle to shocking twists and revelations and a perfect villain. I highly recommend Avengers Infinity war and I'm gonna go with 4.5/5 stars.","displayName":"Advitiya S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-20T02:19:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T00:05:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"977217699","realm":"RT","displayName":"Advitiya S","accountLink":"/user/id/977217699"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 20, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"An intense thrill ride of high stakes and emotionally driven storytelling.
