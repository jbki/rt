There were some cool parts and I enjoyed Gamoras arc, but overall it felt like they were just ticking off boxes. There were a lot of parts that felt really unnecessary. The ending didnt really have any emotional weight to it since you know its not permanent. This wasn't the culmination of 10 years, the next one will be, and maybe watching them together will make Infinity War better but on its own it just isn't a great movie.","displayName":"Riley K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T22:25:59.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T22:32:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"912864590","realm":"RT","displayName":"Riley K","accountLink":"/user/id/912864590"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A groundbreaking movie.
