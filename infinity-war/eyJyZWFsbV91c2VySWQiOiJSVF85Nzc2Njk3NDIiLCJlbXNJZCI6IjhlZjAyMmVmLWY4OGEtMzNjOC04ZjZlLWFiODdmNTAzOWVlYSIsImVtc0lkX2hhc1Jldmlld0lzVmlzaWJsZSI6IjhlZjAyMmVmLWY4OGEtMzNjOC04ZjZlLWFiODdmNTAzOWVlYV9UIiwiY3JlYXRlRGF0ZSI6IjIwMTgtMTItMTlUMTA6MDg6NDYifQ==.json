Did not find anything entertaining about it except for Captain America's entrance. The reason Thanos is able to win is because it was written that way otherwise there were a million and one points at which he could easily have been defeated. His apparent love for his \"daughter\" Gamora was a joke. Nonsense. Not going to be watching the next part.

Buckle in. \nI never, ever check my phone in the theater, but this movie was so awful and just plain boring, I physically could not stop myself from checking the time about an hour in. \nOnto the review! The characters were just doing things because the plot (if we can call that a plot) demanded it, with no sense or reason. Iron Man and the Guardians got the full spotlight despite this being an Avengers movie, and not an Iron Man and the Guardians movie. Thanos's plan made no sense and the focus on Thanos himself pretty much ruined the movie for me. I'm here to watch an AVENGERS movie, not a THANOS movie. I don't care about this big ugly blue alien. I don't care that he feels so bad about killing people. Boohoo. Cry me a river. \nAnyway, all of the action happens (or doesn't) because it's convenient for the plot.\nThe ending was depressingly predictable. \"Killing\" so many characters (despite some of them starring in movies that recently brought in the big bucks) was a pathetic attempt at being a tear-jerker which had zero impact on me. Not because I don't like them, because I do, but first, because it's instantly obvious that they're going to come back somehow, and second, because I was pretty much bored to death at this point of the movie and just desperately waiting for something to happen. Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed. \nI have a lot more stuff to say about this movie, but this is long enough already as it is. \nOne last comment: this movie really brings home the fact that Iron Man, Starlord, and Dr Strange are pretty much just the same character with different costumes. That's bad writing, guys.","displayName":"no n","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-17T14:17:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-17T14:54:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"977666445","realm":"RT","displayName":"no n","accountLink":"/user/id/977666445"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"E誰多 1/2 1/2...誰多 1/2 1/2ic","displayName":"Dab a","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-17T10:17:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-17T10:18:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977666111","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dab a","accountLink":"/user/id/977666111"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"maybe the best marvel movie so far, despite there are too many characters","displayName":"Tommaso A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-17T06:20:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-17T06:21:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"977410762","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tommaso A","accountLink":"/user/id/977410762"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is perfect!","displayName":"Luiz Felipe  D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-17T02:21:29.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-17T02:21:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"977665482","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luiz Felipe  D","accountLink":"/user/id/977665482"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2018"}]}
