This Movie is Fantastic. Its my favorite all time Movie So many outstanding performances. Such a great story line. A virtual express train of a movie- Going from emotional and action packed scene to Another. A new perspective to The Hero Genre. Everyday isnt victories and glory. Somedays, being a hero is a horrible combination of sacrifice, painful decisions, and failure. Captured Beautifully. So many great Performances, I hate to leave anyone out But Josh Brolin could not have done a better job. His “Thanos” was magnificent. He actually elicits some sympathy- hard to do for a megalomaniac!! I want to list the great performances-but to many to list. Suffice to say- you gotta see this movie I cannot wait to see this again. First time in a long time I wanted to go back to the theatre to see a movie again. I may go see this one 5-6 times. The people I saw it with all felt the same way.

However, the sheer number of main characters was overwhelming, especially since I wasn't familiar with the GOG characters.
