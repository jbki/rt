Lots of people argue that it has a bad ending, and that its like half of a movie, but whats the other half? (SPOILER ALERT) \"They have to fight Thanos\" People say but that's a different story. This was his quest for the stones and half of the universe dies. Not the Avengers Turning back time to save a few trillion people.

Again?\nYes, it's impressive that Marvel have built up to this point for the previous ten years. Yes, people are going crazy avoiding spoilers and buying tickets. But that aside, as a film without all the dizzying hype attached Infinity War feels like just another Avengers movie, but with less emotion and more confusion. There comes a point when you use too much CGI. Marvel have reached this point. At times the CGI is a headache inducing, disorientating journey into a universe with too many characters - even for its 2 hour and 39 minute run-time. The list of dislikes and errors seems to long to mention. I judge a film on its ability to stay with you, to make you think about the plot and the characters even days after you've seen it. Avengers, Infinity War leaves you the moment you walk out of the cinema. You stay for two and a half hours to be given an ending that leaves you saying, \"What? That's it?\"","displayName":"Jackson R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/783875421/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-17T02:40:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-07T01:24:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"862950713","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jackson R","accountLink":"/user/id/862950713"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Had 2 pretty good experiences in IMAX 3D and Dolby, great movie.","displayName":"Anonymous User","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-16T20:57:20.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-21T17:44:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"977224783","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anonymous User","accountLink":"/user/id/977224783"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"LA MEJOR PELICULA DE LA HISTORIA\nahre igual no, pero esta muy buena y diferente a las anteriores. recomiendo totalmente verla","displayName":"magaki r","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-16T17:01:27.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T06:11:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"831232380","realm":"RT","displayName":"magaki r","accountLink":"/user/id/831232380"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A solid good time. 9/10","displayName":"Briana R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-16T09:55:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T09:54:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"973487848","realm":"RT","displayName":"Briana R","accountLink":"/user/id/973487848"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"My favourite one yet - packed with everything and orchastrated perfectly","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/694272340782164/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-16T03:44:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T10:02:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"976900682","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976900682"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I'm so Hyped for this it's UNREAL!
