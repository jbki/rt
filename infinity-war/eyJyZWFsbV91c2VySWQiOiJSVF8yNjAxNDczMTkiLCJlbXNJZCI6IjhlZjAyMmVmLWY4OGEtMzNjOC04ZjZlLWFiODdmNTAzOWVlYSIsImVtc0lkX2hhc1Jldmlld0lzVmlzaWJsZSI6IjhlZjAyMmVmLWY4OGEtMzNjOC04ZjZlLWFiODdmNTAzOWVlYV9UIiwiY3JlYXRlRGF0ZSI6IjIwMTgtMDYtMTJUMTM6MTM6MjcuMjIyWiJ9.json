It did feel the focus was largely on the Guardians for a huge chunk of it, and Wanda and Vision, which was nice because they haven't gotten a whole lot in past movies. It was fast-paced and fun, though could have been longer to get a tiny bit more character growth. (I know, I know, it was already long, but I could've sat through another hour without complaint.) Obviously, the ending was rough and it baffles me so many people have complained about it. It's a two-part movie. *Of course* it's going to end on a doom-and-gloom cliffhanger.","displayName":"Kelley Y","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-12T07:15:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-12T07:17:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"905382644","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kelley Y","accountLink":"/user/id/905382644"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great Movie!
