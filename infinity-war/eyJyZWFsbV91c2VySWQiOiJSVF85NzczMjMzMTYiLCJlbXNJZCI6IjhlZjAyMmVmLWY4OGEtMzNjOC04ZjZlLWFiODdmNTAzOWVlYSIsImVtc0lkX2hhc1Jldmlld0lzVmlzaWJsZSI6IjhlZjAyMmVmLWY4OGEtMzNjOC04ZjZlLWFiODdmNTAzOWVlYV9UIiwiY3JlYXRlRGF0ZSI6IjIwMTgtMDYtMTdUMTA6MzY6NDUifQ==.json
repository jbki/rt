Also where was Aunt May?   Character development on Thanos could have been done a bit better but really was good enough.  Not happy with the ending but it had to be that.  Curious to see who ends up being permanently gone.  Cant wait for Ant Man and the Wasp, Captain Marvel and #4.","displayName":"John S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-17T09:00:01.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-17T09:02:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"977323395","realm":"RT","displayName":"John S","accountLink":"/user/id/977323395"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best movie ever!!!!!!!!!

Maybe the story fell down in places but I feel like I was comparing it to Black Panther the while time as that was still so fresh in my mind but I came for a good time and it's exactly what I got. For those giving it a bad rep , looks its a super hero movie get over it . \nStill revelling in this even though my neck still aches because  I had to sit in the front row.","displayName":"Ciara E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-17T05:45:02.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-17T05:52:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"976044497","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ciara E","accountLink":"/user/id/976044497"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Second best marvel movie after winter soldier","displayName":"Adrian M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-17T04:47:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-17T04:48:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"977323130","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adrian M","accountLink":"/user/id/977323130"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"I didn't enjoy this movie. It took me on a confusing long trip and when it finally delivered me to my destination I didn't know it. Nor did any of the audience in the theater which I sat.
