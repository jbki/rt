You just need to open your eyes(or rather brain). Dont tell us how we should feel after watching a particular movie....its ur presumption and ur feeling. General crowd is loving the movie. Its direction is brilliant (more than 50 characters stitched together beautifully) , acting is out of the park kind, action and fight sequence are breath taking , suspense is aww aspiring...ending is out of the box and truely brave and then we have thanos. A villain so powerful yet sypathetic whose methods might be wrong but his vision is relatable. We understand what he is trying to achieve (or on thaat note might have achieved in this movie only).\nWith all these  things there is still a positive point, all is not over yet (only for the comic books movies lover not for the so called meta critics). We are now craving for the second and probably the last part of this storyline, scheduled to release somewhere same time next year. We were waiting for this our entire life and we have got more than we deserve.\nGo watch out the biggest phenomena of this decade without any apprehen\nsions. Its a must watch.\n\nPS - watch out for interactions between thor/rocket , stark/strange , banner aka hulk is different yet brilliant , spidey is cute but thanos is the main person to watch out for.\nAnd yes there is a small fight between avengers and GOG (sorry i tried not to give a single spoiler).","displayName":"Ashish G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1656520335/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T05:07:09.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T05:29:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"974285620","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ashish G","accountLink":"/user/id/974285620"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This film is the perfect first part to the amalgamation of a decade worth of MCU movies","displayName":"Oliver S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T05:06:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T05:07:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"976405675","realm":"RT","displayName":"Oliver S","accountLink":"/user/id/976405675"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I found this movie to be completely satisfying and yet leaving me a hankering to know what's next.","displayName":"Theo G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T05:05:58.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T05:07:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977245326","realm":"RT","displayName":"Theo G","accountLink":"/user/id/977245326"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"best marvel Movie :)))","displayName":"Elias w","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T05:05:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T05:07:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"976922562","realm":"RT","displayName":"Elias w","accountLink":"/user/id/976922562"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely shocking.
