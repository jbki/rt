The shots were interesting and in some points alarming and exciting. I completely enjoyed the flow of the story and the editing kept things moving. Even though there were scenes showing what occurred in the past, because of the excellent editing the story did not slow down or become confusing. Acting, well, superb comes to mind. A must see in my book. Humor, murder?, greed, a pure heart and more.","displayName":"JOHN C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T15:55:27.765Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T15:55:27.765Z","user":{"userId":"a656a16f-b960-4a17-98fd-2091fa602f14","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"JOHN C","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A good whodunnit!
