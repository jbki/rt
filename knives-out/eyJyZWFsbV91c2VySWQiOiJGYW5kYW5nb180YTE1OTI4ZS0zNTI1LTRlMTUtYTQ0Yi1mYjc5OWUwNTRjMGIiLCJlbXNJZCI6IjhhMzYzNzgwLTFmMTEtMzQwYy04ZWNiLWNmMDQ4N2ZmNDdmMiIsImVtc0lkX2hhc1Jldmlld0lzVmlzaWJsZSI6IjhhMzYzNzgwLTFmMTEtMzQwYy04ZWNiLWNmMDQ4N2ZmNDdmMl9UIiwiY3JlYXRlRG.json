It's hard to speak about this movie because there is so much you do not want to spoil for anyone. Nonetheless, superb acting by the entire cast makes this feel like a real-life family affair. Daniel Craig as Leblanc is a \"sleuth of old\" pulled right out of a Colombo flick and dropped down into one of the most fun film sets I've seen in a while. As the movie puts it, \"his whole house is like a clue board\". No stone is left unturned in a way that had me leaving the theater with a smile plastered on my face.","displayName":"Micah R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T15:29:24.416Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T15:29:26.956Z","user":{"userId":"975532706","realm":"RT","displayName":"Micah R","accountLink":"/user/id/975532706"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"loved it--funny suspensful, star studded, super ending!","displayName":"Ann S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T15:28:08.917Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T15:28:08.917Z","user":{"userId":"5f8216a5-8895-4b70-af00-4f8fc5f862a0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ann S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely loved this fun little whodunnit!
