An obvious cash grabbing all star cast mystery with an obvious villain and a pretentious plot. Donâ€™t go to this movie expecting a sense of suspense or action. Just a wild goose chase that flatlines after the second act. Other than that, it has great acting and set design. But a poor use of plot devices that ultimately felt trivial to building up a potentially good plot twist.
