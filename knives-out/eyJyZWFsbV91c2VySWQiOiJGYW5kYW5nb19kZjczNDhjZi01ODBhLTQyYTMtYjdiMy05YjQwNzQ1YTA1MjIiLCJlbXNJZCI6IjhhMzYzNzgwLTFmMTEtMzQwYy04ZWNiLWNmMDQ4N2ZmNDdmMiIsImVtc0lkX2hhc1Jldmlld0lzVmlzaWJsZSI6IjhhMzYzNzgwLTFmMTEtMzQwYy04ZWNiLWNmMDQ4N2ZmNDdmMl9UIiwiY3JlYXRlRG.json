I feel like a movie like Knives out isn't exactly anything Rian has done before. It's a whodunnit, something we don't get very often anymore, but it's a very different one. I've been wanting to see a good whodunnit for a few years now, and murder on the orient express did not please me. So it was a pleasant surprise when this came out. Yes, it actually follows the formula, and doesn't pull out some stupid unneeded twist like many other whodunnits did. But while keeping to it's roots, it's still able to stand alone as it's own movie. I love how Rian presents knives out, from the witty script to the piecing of scenes together. It all runs seamlessly, and I love it.","displayName":"Simon S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-09T05:16:27.480Z","updateDate":"2019-12-09T05:16:32.488Z","user":{"userId":"977218245","realm":"RT","displayName":"Simon S","accountLink":"/user/id/977218245"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Too convoluted a plot that was confusing at the end,  rather than neatly tied up with a surprise.
