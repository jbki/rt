It's a classic who-done-it crime/detective story set in modern day 2019. It's directed beautifully and the cinematography is on point. And it's actually very funny, which I don't think the marketing really shows.\n\nThe performances in this movie are fantastic, especially by Bond himself, Daniel Craig. He carries this movie and honestly his character is an absolute joy to watch. The rest of the cast is great as well, notable performances from Ana De Armas and Chris Evans.\n\nThe narrative and writing is also very well done by Rian Johnson. It's nice to see him doing films of his own instead of big franchise movies.\n\nSome of the characters are kinda there just for comedic effect, but\nI didn't mind it. It wasn't really a bad thing, didn't bother the narrative. My main 'issue' with the movie was that I was hoping the actual plot itself involved more of the characters directly, if you watch the movie you'll probably notice that. It's not really an issue just something I thought would've made the movie better.\n\nOther than that I don't really see an actual flaw in the movie. The opening sequence is just perfect, the sound design fits perfectly. It's funny when it needs to be and suspenseful when it neds to be. Knives Out hits all the checkpoints of a good solid movie.\n\nDefinitely check this one out it's really good, really enjoyable and an absolute killer (no pun intended).","displayName":"Keane O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-11-30T04:54:14.414Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T04:54:17.591Z","user":{"userId":"976384128","realm":"RT","displayName":"Keane O","accountLink":"/user/id/976384128"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Pretty good... the cast were diverse..  longer movie.
