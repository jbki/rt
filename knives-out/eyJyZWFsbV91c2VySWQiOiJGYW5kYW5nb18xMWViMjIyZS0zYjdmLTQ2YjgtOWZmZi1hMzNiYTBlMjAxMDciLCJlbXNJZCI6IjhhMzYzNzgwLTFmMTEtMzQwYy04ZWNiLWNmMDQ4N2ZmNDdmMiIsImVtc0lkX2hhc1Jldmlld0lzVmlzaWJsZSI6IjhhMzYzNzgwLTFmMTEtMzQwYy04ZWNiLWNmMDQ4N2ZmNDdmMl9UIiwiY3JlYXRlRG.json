Well,  I thought it was just very good.  I thought there were a lot of clever lines, and some of the plot twists were pretty cool.  There were some good performances by Jamie Lee Curtis and Daniel Craig.  However, I had a hard time following the plot, and the explanation of the solution of the murder was confusing.
