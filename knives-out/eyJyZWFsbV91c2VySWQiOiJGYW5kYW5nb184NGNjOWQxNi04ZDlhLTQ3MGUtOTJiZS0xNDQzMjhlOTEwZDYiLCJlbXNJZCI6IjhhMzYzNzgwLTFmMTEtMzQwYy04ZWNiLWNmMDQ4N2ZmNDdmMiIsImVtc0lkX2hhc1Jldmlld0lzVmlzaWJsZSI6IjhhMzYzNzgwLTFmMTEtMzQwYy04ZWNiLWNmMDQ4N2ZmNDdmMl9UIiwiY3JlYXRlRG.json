If you go in expecting Clue, it's not that. It's a whodunnit so there's definitely an Agatha Christe vibe that they don't shy away from. The dialogue is very funny but lacks the rapid-fire wit and physical comedy of Clue. The twists are not unbelievable but are well constructed. The thing about the film that makes it stand apart from similar stories is its narrative framing, where you know the truth of the plot early in the film but there are pieces that still don't fit, this culminates in a satisfying finale that leaves you feeling as though you got your money's worth. Some elements felt totally unique, others felt somewhat recycled. All around a great night at the movies!","displayName":"Michael F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T00:13:57.937Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T00:13:57.937Z","user":{"userId":"698e5acc-cdf5-4b41-be26-092c6ff0b979","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael F","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great flick, many twists frol begining to end.","displayName":"donald r","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T00:13:36.458Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T00:13:36.458Z","user":{"userId":"030EEEE4-4175-48C1-A204-230909E9E6DB","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"donald r","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is so amazing I went to see it twice!","displayName":"Emmy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T00:07:54.929Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T00:07:54.929Z","user":{"userId":"ACE1877E-D776-4747-99BA-E8C1C8B89EA7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Emmy","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This ensemble is amazing and tells a brilliant weave of mystery and excitement.","displayName":"Joy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T00:07:24.854Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T00:07:24.854Z","user":{"userId":"1b30f5ee-436b-42ca-8172-78413edb87ce","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joy","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Funny and unpredictable!","displayName":"michelle h","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T00:07:11.137Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T00:07:11.137Z","user":{"userId":"9A46DE1A-5FDF-4156-AE70-64CF10E67A1E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"michelle h","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"}]}
