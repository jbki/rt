A bit of a under-exaggeration, as it is a charming movie that really pulls of the mystery genre well. It's an enticing story that is complex enough to satisfy most audience, but not so complex that people will be leaving the theaters confused. \nOf course, there will always be things to nitpick, such as over-handed symbolism and lulls in the engagement, but it stays relatively refreshing through its runtime and has an extremely satisfying ending, built upon two hours of great story telling.\n\nThis is an amazing screenplay, and Rian Johnson is both a great director and writer. A must-watch film.","displayName":"Andy S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2578219225599093/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T06:10:02.157Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T06:10:57.249Z","user":{"userId":"978421653","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andy S","accountLink":"/user/id/978421653"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved the story.

Emphatic praise is everywhere for this flick, yet at its end, I personally felt let down. I was anticipating a mystery weaved of a much more elaborate and dramatic web embellished with further tangles, twists, and reveals, when what I actually got was more akin to a relatively simple puzzle, both light-hearted and very funny in nature (the cast is outstanding; Daniel Craig and Toni Collette steal the show). This movie, to me, is a wonderful example of a puzzle in which the assembling of its pieces is more rewarding than the beholding of its completed picture. For what this movie is -- a very fun, somewhat challenging little mystery, sadly sporting a conclusion in which I found it quite unsurprising and dissatisfying upon learning who the culprit was -- it is, in truth, very well made (after all, it does feature the funniest analogy I've ever heard, relating a murder mystery to a donut). However, as a legitimate, complex, suspenseful, thrilling, durable whodunit symphony of surprise and chaos orchestrated by one or multiple masterminds that will continue to fascinate with repeated viewings (as was the impression I had attained from all its praise), this movie unfortunately falls short. To push comparisons a bit further just for kicks, one could even say watching the film is like wanting a 1,000-piece puzzle but instead receiving a 500-piece puzzle -- it's still something to work with, yet it leaves you...unfulfilled.","displayName":"John S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100004096696928/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T06:03:11.061Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T06:03:13.666Z","user":{"userId":"933027027","realm":"RT","displayName":"John S","accountLink":"/user/id/933027027"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"The trailer promised me a whodunit, but that's not exactly what I got.
