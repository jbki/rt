It is packed with beloved faces that provide a sturdy base for an amazingly twisty script and plot line. The relationships and character development is beautiful and I love Daniel Craig's performance in this one. The movie really gives the audience something to bite down on and a plot that doesn't melt away and reveal its true nature within the first 30 minutes; the development is perfectly timed out and serves to add suspense and a satisfying ending. The only cringe worthy part of this movie is the self serving liberal character Meg played by Katherine Langford, but then again I think the character was supposed to be hated or at least I hope so. Overall its a must see for sure!","displayName":"Chloe B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T11:35:30.732Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T11:35:40.461Z","user":{"userId":"978416919","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chloe B","accountLink":"/user/id/978416919"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was a really well done classic murder mystery.
