Don't go to see this expecting to laugh out loud the entire time.  This film stays true to its roots and pays an homage to the 1970's detective genre with a modern wit that truly makes for a fun, engaging, and truly enjoyable film.  Plus, the cast is irresistible.","displayName":"Brendan A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100004740315549/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T05:17:27.714Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T05:17:47.823Z","user":{"userId":"799227874","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brendan A","accountLink":"/user/id/799227874"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good movie , very good actors  , I went with my two kids 15 and 13 they loved this movie I enjoyed from the beginning to end .","displayName":"Alex O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T05:16:25.765Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T05:18:58.340Z","user":{"userId":"b76e57ee-71e6-49c1-9f88-7c915cab2e08","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Alex O","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Captured me immediately with the intrigue, twists and turns as the movie unfolded.
