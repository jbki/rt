Although it's dressed up as a fairly typical whodunit, it violates all the expectations of the genre -- simultaneously keeping you off balance and on the edge of your seat while ultimately managing to deliver a very satisfactory murder mystery that doubles as an effective social commentary as well.  Daniel Craig is wonderful, as is the entire cast -- I especially liked Toni Collette's skin-care guru.  That woman can do so much with so little.  Highly recommended.","displayName":"Steven C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-11T15:01:37.358Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T15:01:37.358Z","user":{"userId":"97207b10-804b-43fa-b9e5-07d199ffea00","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Steven C","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Just enough twists!
