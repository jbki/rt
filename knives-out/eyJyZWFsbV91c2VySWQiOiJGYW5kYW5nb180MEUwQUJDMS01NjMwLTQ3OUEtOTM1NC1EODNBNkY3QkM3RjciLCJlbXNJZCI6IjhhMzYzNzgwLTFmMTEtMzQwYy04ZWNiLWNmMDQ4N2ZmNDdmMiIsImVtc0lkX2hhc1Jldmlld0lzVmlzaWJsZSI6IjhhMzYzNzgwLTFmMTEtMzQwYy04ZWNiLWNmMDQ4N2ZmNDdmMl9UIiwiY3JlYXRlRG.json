Ana De Armas, Chris Evans, and Daniel Craig are standouts as are what will likely be considered underrated performances by Christopher Plummer and Michael Shannon.\n\nA funny murder mystery that is elevated by a superb cast and great cinematography.\n\nLast bit of the final act is a little rushed and leaves a bit to be desired but the first 2/3rds of the movie are amazing. \n\nI personally plan on seeing it again in theaters and will eventually own it in my blu-ray collection.\n\n4 1/2 out of 5 stars.","displayName":"Eric S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T20:56:07.271Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T20:56:07.271Z","user":{"userId":"978405915","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eric S","accountLink":"/user/id/978405915"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The crazy plot twists .","displayName":"DAN","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T20:16:58.670Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T20:16:58.670Z","user":{"userId":"15385927-dedd-41a4-a1f6-219b7187714e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"DAN","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Entertaining.
