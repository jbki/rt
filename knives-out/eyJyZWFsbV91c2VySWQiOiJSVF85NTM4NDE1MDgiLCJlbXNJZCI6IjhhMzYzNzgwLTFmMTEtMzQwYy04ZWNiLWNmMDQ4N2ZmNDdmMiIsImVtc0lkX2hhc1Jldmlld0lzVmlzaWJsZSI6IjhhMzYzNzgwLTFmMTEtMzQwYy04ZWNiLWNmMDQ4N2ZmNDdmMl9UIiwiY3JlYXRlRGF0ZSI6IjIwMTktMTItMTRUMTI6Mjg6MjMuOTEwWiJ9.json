You literally will not be able to guess \"whodoneit\" until that point where the detective recaps everything into a nicely explained revelation.  And the running gag of one of the main characters is ingenious.  Unfortunately, its release so near the holiday blockbuster season may mean too many people will miss it in theaters.

From a surface level perspective, it was serviceable. Not particularly intelligent or extraordinary in any way. As a \"who-dun-it\", it's actually quite ineffective, since it doesn't really surprise you. And anything yhat does surprise you, doesn't really make all that much sense. It's more for shock value rather than in-depth quality. But at least it wasn't terrible. The polotics, however....should probably stay out of it.","displayName":"Philip  H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-14T10:55:59.208Z","updateDate":"2019-12-14T10:56:19.526Z","user":{"userId":"977695838","realm":"RT","displayName":"Philip  H","accountLink":"/user/id/977695838"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Kept you guessing.\nHumorous \nA very entertaining enjoyable film.","displayName":"Mike","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-14T10:33:39.697Z","updateDate":"2019-12-14T10:33:39.697Z","user":{"userId":"d424e4e3-7bcc-40ac-a81b-03003c28317d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mike","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Slow, was well shot but I did sleep through most of it..","displayName":"El Ryfinnc","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-14T08:45:41.971Z","updateDate":"2019-12-14T08:45:41.971Z","user":{"userId":"12974145-C85F-464B-B674-EBA416C6F144","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"El Ryfinnc","accountLink":null},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"If you loved Agatha Christie, Nero Wolfe and classic murder mysteries, or you have a family that makes holidays as stressful as a mafia summit, then this movie is a must for you.
