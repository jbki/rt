It makes the consumer want to spend money, time, and effort to go see this movie. Unfortunately, it is one of the more boring, weak plottted, and long winded movies I have suffered through in quite a while. Good cast, give or take, but a really idiotic overplayed storyline. Very choppy as well, whatever that means.
