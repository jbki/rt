I really enjoyed this film, everything about it from the ensemble cast and script, to the genuine feelings of shock and uncertainty I felt, as did my entire auditorium from what I could see and hear. The fact that there is always something happening on screen throughout the 2-hour runtime to keep you guessing, really sets this film apart from other murder mysteries. Every scene of dialogue between any two or more characters always comes back into play down the road, and more often than not, in ways you truly will not see coming. Rian Johnson wrote one hell of a clever story here from start to finish I was fully into the mystery and never bored. There were a few clichd moments easy for me to notice, but nothing that came close to ruining the experience for me. \n\nWith a cast including Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Lakeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, and Christopher Plummer, you know youre going to be in for a treat. And not one of these fantastic actors disappointed! Every character brought something different and interesting, and surprisingly every instance of humor really worked for me. The one standout for me though, is Chris Evans. What he brings to this bully of a character is something we normally dont see from him, which was so refreshing to see. Coming in a close second to Evans was Daniel Craig, which I didnt expect. From the trailers I honestly thought his character would be nothing but goofy, hamming it up nonstop for the camera, but wow was I wrong! This really is a brilliant, sometimes explosive performance from Craig its an excellent performance like this which comes around every so often to make me once again truly appreciate his talents. I definitely recommend checking this one out with the age-appropriate family this holiday weekend.","displayName":"DeVaughn B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-11-28T23:21:33.069Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T23:21:33.069Z","user":{"userId":"cfb09a34-deaa-474b-b7c6-7b043894629f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"DeVaughn B","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Long, drawn out and not funny.
