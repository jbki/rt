The first half hour of KNIVES OUT had me admittedly disappointed considering it was unfolding as a standard story with a few funny moment sprinkled in. However, an emotional gut-punch was followed by smart bursts of wit and tension, with the rest of the movie stunning me in its creativity, unique premise, and exceptional characters (with Ana de Armas putting in an especially compelling performance). I'm eager to convince my family to watch KNIVES OUT with me this Thanksgiving week, because it was one of my best theater experiences of the year!","displayName":"Daniel S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T20:58:16.046Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T01:09:54.019Z","user":{"userId":"964644714","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel S","accountLink":"/user/id/964644714"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Very entertaining.

And I am so glad I was able to go, because it was one of the best movies I've seen this year. (And that's without my bias towards coming-of-age stories)\n\nRian Johnson writes and directs this movie, and it's such a great job from him all around. You can tell this was written the way good mysteries are supposed to be written - backwards. There are so many good twists and turns that reference things happening earlier in the movie. It's the type of mystery that the viewer can solve, if you're paying attention. And on top of that, it manages to be absolutely hilarious the entire time. The humor is witty. The mystery is a modern take on a old genre. It breaks a few tropes to find it's own path. And it's just an amazing journey.\n\nIf I start listing actors and actresses who give good performances, you'll just wind up seeing the entire cast list. Seriously, the cast includes Daniel Craig, Katherine Langford, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Ana de Armas, Lakeith Stanfield, Michael Shannon, Christopher Plummer, and others. And every performance is top notch. Nothing feels out of character. Every character has distinct traits. Every actor and actress understands their character and works towards that. The emotion is real. The expressions are real. It deserves all of the praise it gets.\n\nThis movie is an event. Take your friends and your family to this movie and I can all but guarantee you will enjoy this movie.","displayName":"Sheldon C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000397211214/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T20:12:52.711Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T20:13:00.373Z","user":{"userId":"954300926","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sheldon C","accountLink":"/user/id/954300926"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Ignore any noise being spouted from jaded 'Star Wars' fanboys. Rian Johnson is among the finest filmmakers currently working in Hollywood.\n\nConsider his resume: he wrote and directed 'Brick;' he wrote and directed 'The Brothers Bloom;' he wrote and directed 'Looper;' he directed the Breaking Bad episodes 'Fly,' 'Fifty-One,' and 'Ozymandias;' and most recently he wrote and directed easily the best murder-mystery of the year, 'Knives Out.'\n\nThe plot is dense and brilliantly serpentine--just as one should expect from a quintessential film of the genre--taking on the characteristics of an ouroboros.\n\nEach of the characters in the film are familiar, flawed, and driven by their own delightfully selfish motivations.\n\nBut it's the writing--oh the wonderful writing!--that makes this picture as powerful and poetic as it is. From the plot to the dialogue to the very last gasps of the denouement, Johnson keeps the audience completely rapt and on the edge of their seats wishing the saga could somehow continue ad infinitum.","displayName":"Metaflix M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T20:03:53.236Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T20:03:55.297Z","user":{"userId":"975854408","realm":"RT","displayName":"Metaflix M","accountLink":"/user/id/975854408"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Rian Johnson shows pretty much everyone what someone in complete control of his craft looks like.
