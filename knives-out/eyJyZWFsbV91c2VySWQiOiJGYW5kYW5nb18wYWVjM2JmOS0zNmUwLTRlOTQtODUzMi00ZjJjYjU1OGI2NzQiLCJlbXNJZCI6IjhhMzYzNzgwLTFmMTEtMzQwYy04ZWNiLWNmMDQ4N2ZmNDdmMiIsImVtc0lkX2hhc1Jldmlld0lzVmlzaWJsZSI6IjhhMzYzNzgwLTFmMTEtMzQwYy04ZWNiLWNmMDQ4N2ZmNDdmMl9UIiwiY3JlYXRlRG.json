Could have been a Columbo episode. Doesn't hold up to the cleverness of Agatha Christie on an off day, let alone best-of. It isn't even a \"whodunit\" because there's no murder. The \"villain\" is obvious and predictable from the beginning. Waste of Jamie Lee Curtis and other good actors. There is no shocking twist at the end. Very average comedy. Save it for pay-per-view.","displayName":"Karen H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-09T18:03:15.801Z","updateDate":"2019-12-09T18:03:22.979Z","user":{"userId":"976009635","realm":"RT","displayName":"Karen H","accountLink":"/user/id/976009635"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good mystery whodunit.
