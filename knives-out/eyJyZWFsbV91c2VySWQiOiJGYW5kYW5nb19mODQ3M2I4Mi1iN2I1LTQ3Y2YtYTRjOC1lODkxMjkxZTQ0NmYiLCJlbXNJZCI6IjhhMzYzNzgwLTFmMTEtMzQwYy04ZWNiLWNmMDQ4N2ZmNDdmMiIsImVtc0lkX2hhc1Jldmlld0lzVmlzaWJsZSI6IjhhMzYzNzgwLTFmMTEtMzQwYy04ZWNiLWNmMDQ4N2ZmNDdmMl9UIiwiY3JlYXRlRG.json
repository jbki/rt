The characters have dimension and manage to be flawed without being caricatures. Frankly the trailer did it a disservice because it made the family look like one dimensional monsters, and the movie is much more nuanced than that. It's an excellent mystery with just the right mix of comedy to break the tension. Definitely worth seeing.","displayName":"Illusion-XIII","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-10T03:20:16.143Z","updateDate":"2019-12-10T03:20:16.143Z","user":{"userId":"585A855C-031F-4162-A2C1-C9C5F1633DE3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Illusion-XIII","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good writing, great cast,  not enough mystery.
