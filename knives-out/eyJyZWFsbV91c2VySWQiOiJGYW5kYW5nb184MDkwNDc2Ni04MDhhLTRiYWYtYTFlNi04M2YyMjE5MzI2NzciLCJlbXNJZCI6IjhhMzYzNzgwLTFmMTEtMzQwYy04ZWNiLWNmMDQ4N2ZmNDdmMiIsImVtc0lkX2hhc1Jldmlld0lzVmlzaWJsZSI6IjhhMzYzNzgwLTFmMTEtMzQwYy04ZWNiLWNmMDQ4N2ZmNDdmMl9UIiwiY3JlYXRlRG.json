It's just so great to see Daniel Craig enjoying himself and throwing himself into the character of Bennot Blanc, think Hercules Poirot but southern. An exciting and well executed comeback for Rian Johnson, coming off a divisive some may say failed Star Wars movie. It's so nice to see a movie with a well constructed plot like this. The best mysteries have twists and turns that are unexpected but also feel like you should have seen it coming. The most effective and well conceived reveals are the ones that don't feel like they come out of nowhere. The best surpises are when all the peices are laid out and the audience is connecting them but still a few steps behind the story and then when you get that revelation all the other pieces fill themselves in because it was set up properly","displayName":"Evan D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10203971702682556/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-06T04:24:29.256Z","updateDate":"2019-12-06T04:24:41.881Z","user":{"userId":"973044479","realm":"RT","displayName":"Evan D","accountLink":"/user/id/973044479"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Modern day Columbo episode - made for TV","displayName":"David","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-06T04:15:03.866Z","updateDate":"2019-12-06T04:15:03.866Z","user":{"userId":"ebedc6de-14f1-48dd-99c2-9a83dd91524f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"David","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"start to finish, keeps you guessing!","displayName":"tom","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-06T04:08:39.875Z","updateDate":"2019-12-06T04:08:39.875Z","user":{"userId":"493A3480-8148-45C1-9485-A993CCCEC016","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"tom","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 06, 2019"}]}
