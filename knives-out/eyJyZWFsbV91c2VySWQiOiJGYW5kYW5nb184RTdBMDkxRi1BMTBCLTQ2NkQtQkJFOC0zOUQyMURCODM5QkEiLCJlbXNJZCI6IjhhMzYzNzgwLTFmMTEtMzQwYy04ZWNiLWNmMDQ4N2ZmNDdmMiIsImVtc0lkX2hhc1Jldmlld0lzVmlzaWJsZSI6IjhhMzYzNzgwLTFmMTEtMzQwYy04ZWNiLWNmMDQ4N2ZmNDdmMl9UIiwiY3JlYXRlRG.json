From the amazing cast to a superb story, this film just proves to be a one of a kind.  Although this film is well casted, it manages to not give them all enough screen time, which if that's what you were most excited about, I wouldn't get my hopes up. However, that doesn't stop every actor from shining, because each person steals the show when given the spotlight. Leaving you to question who was your favorite character!? If that doesn't do justice for you, then the story will make it up to you. Yes, this film does promise to give you a great mystery film with some twisty twists, even if it may have some slow moments for you. Though I would not claim this film to be a \"who done it\" type film, as it loses the feel at some point in the movie (though set pieces are great for a clue type movie, which set design needs some recognition for). More like a thriller/mystery film that will have you wanting more and keep your eyes glued to the screen while your brain is trying to put the pieces together, a donut in a donut (movie inside joke)! So overall, a well-done film that is perfect for Thanksgiving month and a film you should watch with the family on Thanksgiving night after a big feast! The movie is Holmes and you and whomever you're watching it with is Watson. Is this a film you should watch in the movies? That is entirely up to you, whether you stream it or watch it in the theater, it is worth it either way. A must-see film.","displayName":"Christian A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T01:13:40.728Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T01:13:45.698Z","user":{"userId":"978253571","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christian A","accountLink":"/user/id/978253571"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best movies I have seen in some time: original and refreshing.
