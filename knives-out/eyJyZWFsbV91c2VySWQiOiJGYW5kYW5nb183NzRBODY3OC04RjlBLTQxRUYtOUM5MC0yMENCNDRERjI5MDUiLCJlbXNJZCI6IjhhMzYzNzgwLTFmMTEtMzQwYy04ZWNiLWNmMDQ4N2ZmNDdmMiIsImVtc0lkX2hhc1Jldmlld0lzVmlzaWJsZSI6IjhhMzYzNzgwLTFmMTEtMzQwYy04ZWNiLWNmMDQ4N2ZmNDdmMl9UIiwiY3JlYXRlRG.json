This is the premise behind Knives Out, a delightfully twisted murder-mystery-comedy set in an old mansion that, as one character puts it, resembles a Clue board game. Or perhaps the set to Sleuth. Enter an eccentric but brilliant detective with a slow southern drawl and an anonymous client and a house full of greedy, deceitful relatives to spice things up. Add more twists and turns than a Monte Carlo road race and you are in for one delightful time at the movies. With a Best Original Screenplay nomination almost guaranteed, Knives Out is great fun.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T03:44:50.623Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T03:44:59.272Z","user":{"userId":"260280367","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260280367"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It kept me guessing.","displayName":"Fawna T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T03:44:22.772Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T03:44:22.772Z","user":{"userId":"26181109-EF62-4E52-A5EC-ABC0DEE84261","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Fawna T","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Entertaining throughout.
