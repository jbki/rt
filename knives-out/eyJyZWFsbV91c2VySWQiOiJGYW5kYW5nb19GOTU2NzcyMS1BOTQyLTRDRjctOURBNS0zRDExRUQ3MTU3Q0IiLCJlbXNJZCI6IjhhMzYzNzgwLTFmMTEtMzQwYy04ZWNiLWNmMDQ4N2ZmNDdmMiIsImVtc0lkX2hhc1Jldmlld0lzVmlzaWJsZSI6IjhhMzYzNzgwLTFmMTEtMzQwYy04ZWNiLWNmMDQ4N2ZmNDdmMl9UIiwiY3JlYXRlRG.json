The cinematography brilliantly highlights the mood in the scenes and makes you feel like you're in the scene yourself. The character development is impeccable and leaves the watcher on the edge of their seat. I loved the dramatic irony throughout the film as well as the attention to detail with the plot. Towards the end of the movie, Daniel Craig really shone like a star. As much as I thought I could guess the plot, I was only half-right in the end, but I was left with no questions. My experience was definitely enhanced by the atmosphere of movie theater, but I am guessing I would not have enjoyed this movie as much if I was at home. I fully intend on watching this movie again to see some details I missed while I was watching. Incredible film","displayName":"Annabella P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100004458524296/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-18T16:39:00.655Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T16:39:44.717Z","user":{"userId":"957625439","realm":"RT","displayName":"Annabella P","accountLink":"/user/id/957625439"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Utterly predictable in every way.
