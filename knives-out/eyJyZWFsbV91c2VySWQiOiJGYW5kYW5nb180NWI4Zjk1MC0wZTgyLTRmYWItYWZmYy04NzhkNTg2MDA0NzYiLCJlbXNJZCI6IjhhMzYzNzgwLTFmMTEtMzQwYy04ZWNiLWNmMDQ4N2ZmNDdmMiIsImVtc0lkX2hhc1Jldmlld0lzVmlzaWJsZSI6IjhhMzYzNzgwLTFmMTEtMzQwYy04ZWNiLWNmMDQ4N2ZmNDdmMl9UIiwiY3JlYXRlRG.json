Sold it to my family, who was shooting me darts out of their eyes. thought it was a movie spoof of the clue movie. The Previews implied that. Jamie Lee Curtis, who I thought would be the lead in the movie, just had a few moments throughout the movie. Way too much pukeing going on. Overdid that. If you hadn't read the book, and if Daniel Craigs part didn't explain it, the plot and twist would be near impossible to follow. Guilt was never clear, even at the end. They needed to have cut about 30 mins out of the movie. the middle just drug on and on and on.","displayName":"Bert M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T02:25:57.542Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T02:25:57.542Z","user":{"userId":"5a3cc133-dee2-43fa-b72d-67f075c4784a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bert M","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"}]}
