What I expected was a murder mystery to follow along with, but what was delivered was a little too much exposition.  When a movie has to explain itself as it goes along, it takes out the fun of the ride.  \nAlso- Daniel Craig's accent changed as many times as his character.  This character is presented as strong and wise, then bumbling, then suspicious, then clueless, then omniscient...  not a good element of writing.","displayName":"Brent S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T14:57:08.820Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T14:57:08.820Z","user":{"userId":"223861e5-58a0-45f8-ac9f-d5eb38463bc7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Brent S","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great who done it movie.
