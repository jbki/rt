The cast is amazing in their roles and the storyline takes a few unsuspecting turns to make this a fresh whodunnit. Besides Rian Johnson's insistence in throwing a confusing social justice angle that adds nothing like he did in Star Wars, the movie is probably the best one I have seen in theaters in a long time.","displayName":"Matt F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001340028782/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T02:59:19.707Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T02:59:23.575Z","user":{"userId":"969919920","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt F","accountLink":"/user/id/969919920"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A perfect who done it","displayName":"Ric S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T02:58:15.043Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T02:58:15.043Z","user":{"userId":"266db50b-c84e-4459-86a8-e810411dc51e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ric S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"This is a long slog. It feels like it's 5 hours long. There are no laughs, so I don't know why people think it's funny. The ending of a murder mystery should allow the audience to look back and realize that they should have and could have figured it out. This was impossible because all the information isn't presented until the end. It's okay, but the first half is painfully slow. I went to the restroom and missed absolutely nothing.","displayName":"John M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T02:55:02.206Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T02:55:10.169Z","user":{"userId":"977719430","realm":"RT","displayName":"John M","accountLink":"/user/id/977719430"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I was not intrigued by the trailer, but my wife wanted to see it, so glad we went.
