I think the acting was very well done with just enough camp. Some of the humor tries to be too trendy, and will not age well. Parts were very funny though. At least one slow part an older lady fell asleep and started snoring during that part, which made it amusing. I think it tries to be more clever than it actually is, but was enjoyable. I would see it again if it was free on a streaming service.","displayName":"Patricia D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T15:50:59.371Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T17:08:52.641Z","user":{"userId":"23a860fa-58b8-493a-b956-d9e660c0a72a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Patricia D","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Another absolutely slam dunk.
