Rian Johnson never passes on an opportunity to sacrifice the quality of a movie in order to push his personal agenda, but here we go again with him putting in at least 3 separate scenes that are so brutally cringe inducing that I couldn't even watch. I almost walked out of the movie at one point.","displayName":"Connor T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T00:24:42.343Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T00:24:42.343Z","user":{"userId":"978414949","realm":"RT","displayName":"Connor T","accountLink":"/user/id/978414949"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Humorous and keeps you engaged","displayName":"Alex","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T00:24:28.716Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T00:24:28.716Z","user":{"userId":"3B8D3B5D-2C07-4143-8898-3DFA7BA823F8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Alex","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"could have been a contender however overacting, weak plot and too long made it a snoozer for me.
