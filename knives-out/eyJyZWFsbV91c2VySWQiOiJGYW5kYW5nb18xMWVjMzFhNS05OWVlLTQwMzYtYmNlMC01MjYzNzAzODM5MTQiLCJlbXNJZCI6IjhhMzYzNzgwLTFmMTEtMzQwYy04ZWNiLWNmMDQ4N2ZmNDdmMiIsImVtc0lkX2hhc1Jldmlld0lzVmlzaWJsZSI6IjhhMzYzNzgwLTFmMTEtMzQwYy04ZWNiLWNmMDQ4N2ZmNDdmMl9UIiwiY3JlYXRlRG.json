Super enjoyable. Watching Craig unravel this masterpiece while the audience knows what happens half way into it was different. While the guilty party and cast try and outsmart him was fun. Then the trickery and deception gets the best of the audience! Just wow. What a ride. More twists than a Pretzel. Rian did great with this!

Theres obvious culprits and unknown culprits and with few exceptions, they all have a strong devotion to family especially if you keep in mind that family starts with yourself. Good acting, great writing and tons of humor. Clearly the director is a big fan of the genre and he did not screw this up.

For the record, I actually agree with his politics so please don't @ me. But good stories make for intelligent social commentary, not the other way around.\n\nThe cast are brilliant though so that's something!","displayName":"Mitchell A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/887011674776487/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T11:43:02.482Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T01:24:38.705Z","user":{"userId":"975123409","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mitchell A","accountLink":"/user/id/975123409"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fun,  hilarious and twists that come at you.","displayName":"Max Dzul","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T11:29:36.296Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T02:30:24.966Z","user":{"userId":"4AAE3C6D-A688-4E7B-A1D9-BF4BBB7D3A07","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Max Dzul","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best movies of 2019 with an all-star cast.
