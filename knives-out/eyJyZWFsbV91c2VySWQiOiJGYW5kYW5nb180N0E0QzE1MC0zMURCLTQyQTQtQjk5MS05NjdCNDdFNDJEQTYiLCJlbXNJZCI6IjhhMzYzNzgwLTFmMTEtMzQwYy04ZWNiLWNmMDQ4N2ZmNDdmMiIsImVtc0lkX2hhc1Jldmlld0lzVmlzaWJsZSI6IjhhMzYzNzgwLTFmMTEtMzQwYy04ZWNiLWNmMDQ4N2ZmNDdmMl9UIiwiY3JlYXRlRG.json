I watched 20 mins of this movie and then left because it was so predictable. Again, I never finished watching the movie. The nurse obviously did it. Money is somehow involved because Harlan was rich and the family is greedy. Ransom obviously hired the detective because he’s the only one that didn’t show to the house, and did so because he was left out of the will or didn’t get the amount of money he wanted or something even though he doesn’t even like or love his Grandfather. But why else would the nurse kill Harlan unless she was already in the will, which means Ransom is probably the only one who know the nurse gets everything and so he’s try to pin it on her, but surprise, she actually did kill him. Blah blah blah cliché cliché cliché. Very good acting but a second rate script. They should have gotten Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat to write it and it would have been good and an actual mystery.
