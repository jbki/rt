Cast is perfect, Especially Craig and de Aramas.  Funny, but not at the expense of a great \"Christie\" mystery.  Can Plummer possibly be 85?  Still has some serious acting chops.  My pick for Best Picture.  I think all but the idiot in the row below us who was devoted to his phone enjoyed it.  most will.  BTW, both my wife and I felt for sure Blanc was going to get thirsty while in the car waiting for Marta.","displayName":"Mark F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T11:33:21.296Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T11:33:21.296Z","user":{"userId":"8fe9ba10-8303-470a-94e8-18e867df1f09","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mark F","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's not often that at the end of a movie the audience break into a spontaneous round of applause, such was the case when I recently attended a screening of Knives Out.\nThe last time I experienced such a reaction was after seeing Pan's Labyrinth so Knives Out is in exceedingly illustrious company.\nIt's difficult to review a movie like this without giving away too much. It's enough to say it's a movie of the highest quality, from the whitty, razor sharp intelligent script, with lt's sprinkling of current social references, to the maze like twists and turns of the plot which keeps you guessing and entertained right to the final credits.\nA terrific cast who all play their part in this whodunnit but there's no doubt that the 2 \"lead\" actors steal the show. Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas are terrific in their respective parts, there's hardly a scene that one or both of them are not present. \nBoth nail their characters physical mannerisms superbly, from Craig's coin flipping and piano dabbling to de Armas's nervous foot twitching and general restless expressions when reflecting on events that have occurred.\nOn leaving the cinema most of the comments I overheard were, Excellent, superb, and she( Ana de Armas) was fantastic. \nSo to anyone who appreciates a high quality movie experience to escape the drab of pre packaged superhero nonsense this is a must see, at least once, I suspect a second viewing will unveil more delights in this gem of a movie.","displayName":"Aidan M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T11:27:32.814Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T11:27:42.646Z","user":{"userId":"882121606","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aidan M","accountLink":"/user/id/882121606"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Totally entertaining.

It's a mystery which never gets too complicated that you can't follow it, but is never so simple that the answer leaps straight out at you. It gives us a set of characters connected by a tragic event, establishes their backstories, reveals them to be liars and deceivers and lets the story unfold through their largely self-serving actions. Daniel Craig ressurects his southern accent to give us, essentially James Bond Poirot, relishing in the opportunity to dissect the tiniest of clues and deliver his theories to the suspects in longform. It never feels too long or exhausting, and keeps us guessing right up until the very end, as all the best mysteries do. It has its odd genre trope here and there, including the obligatory tell-all speech by the investigator and the perpetrator being among the last people you'd point the finger at. But Johnson knows exactly what he's doing and sprinkles a series of little hints here and there just to keep you on your toes. One of 2019s most entertaining pictures, and one that I'm positive was as much fun to make as it was to watch.","displayName":"Wayne K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10205949674155460/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T11:16:28.092Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T11:16:28.511Z","user":{"userId":"970610344","realm":"RT","displayName":"Wayne K","accountLink":"/user/id/970610344"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"great balance between comedy and tension/ suspense. it is difficult to have funny parts without taking you out of the story. very well written and i kind of flips what you expect to learn / to happen on its head early on.","displayName":"Andrew C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T11:06:21.493Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T11:06:21.493Z","user":{"userId":"978419377","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew C","accountLink":"/user/id/978419377"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great story and casting","displayName":"Billy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T11:05:33.163Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T11:05:33.163Z","user":{"userId":"038aea3c-1af2-4014-b625-92dac995c7ea","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Billy","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Does anyone care about vulgar language anymore? Read reviews about this movie, entertaining, best of the year, famous actors and actresses in it. So we decided to check it out.  Some families were there with children. I wonder if the writers think that families talk that way to each other, I wonder if actors have no say in what they have to speak in a film ? ?  It could have been just as entertaining without all the four letter words, come on people, be kind, decent, and watch your mouth, maybe you will start a new trend and others will see the advantage of it.","displayName":"Gregory","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T11:05:16.356Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T11:05:16.356Z","user":{"userId":"48572126-9db7-4e96-9146-05e1a1ada978","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Gregory","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"}]}
