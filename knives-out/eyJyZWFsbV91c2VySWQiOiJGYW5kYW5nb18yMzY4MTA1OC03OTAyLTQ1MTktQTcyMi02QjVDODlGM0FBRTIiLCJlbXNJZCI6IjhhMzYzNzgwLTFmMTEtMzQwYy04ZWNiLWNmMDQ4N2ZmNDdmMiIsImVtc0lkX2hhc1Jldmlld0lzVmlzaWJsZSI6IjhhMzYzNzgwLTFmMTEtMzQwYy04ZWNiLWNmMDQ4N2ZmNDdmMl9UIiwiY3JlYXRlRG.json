For those who said it was boring and too long, I actually wish it had gone on longer...I enjoyed it that much. The more I ruminate on it, the more I find to love about it. Good performances and I particularly liked Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson here. This is not the greatest film of all time, but it sure is a fun ride and fantastic movie!
