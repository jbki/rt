Brilliant plot, stunning settings (the mansion was beautiful and everything inside it), the color scheme made it look classic somehow and every actor brought their A-game to their role. They all looked liked they were having a blast, especially Daniel Craig and Chris Evans. The musical scores were amazing and the film was full of humor. My audience crowd and I were cackling throughout and the film kept you guessing, with it's twists and turns, to the very end. Hollywood is so obsessed with making superhero films and animated films and it's refreshing to finally see a film, so unique from the usual fare, that is so cleverly put together and just a joy to watch. I'll be definitely seeing it again and I encourage everyone else to go see it, especially ones who want to see something unique, other than the usual animated and/or superhero films.","displayName":"Bethany J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2328766267158423/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T06:35:16.240Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T06:35:28.905Z","user":{"userId":"978193012","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bethany J","accountLink":"/user/id/978193012"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great cast, deft and witty script, fun start-to-finish.","displayName":"John M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T06:25:05.377Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T06:25:05.377Z","user":{"userId":"a211bf1c-0539-4475-aa07-1be9ec00b572","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"John M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"a good movie really recommend it! it dosent seem like it takes two hours.","displayName":"Yesenia Zuniga","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T06:15:03.690Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T06:15:03.690Z","user":{"userId":"48c5dcac-a86b-48f1-be2b-3343422ac8b7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Yesenia Zuniga","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great fun!

Great acting ! Comical with unexpected plot twists and turns. Really enjoyed every moment. Well paced, witty dialog and each actor played their parts well. Daniel Craig leads with a stellar performance. Saw it twice this weekend and would see it again ! The lady next to me kept jumping and squealing from surprise. I was not quite on the edge of My seat the entire time but just when I thought I had it figured out another plot twist would lead me down a different road. Creatively cast, many fun mostly politically incorrect topics and jokes weaved into a murder mystery that keeps you captivated from the beginning which surpassed  my expectations.
