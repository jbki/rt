Yes, it was meant to be overblown, but couldn't they find him a dialect coach? Was Foghorn Leghorn his model? I almost walked out after he began speaking. I'm glad I got over it and stayed. Go! It's so much fun, Every other character, was, well, a real character--and so well-played! The clever script doesn't fail to surprise.","displayName":"Scott C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T13:33:12.085Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T13:33:12.085Z","user":{"userId":"08d37d18-c13c-46e3-a499-e924f8c97ec1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Scott C","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Rian Johnson's \"Knives Out\" is a gripping murder mystery with subtle political undertones that is fueled by fantastic performances from a star-studded cast. With his latest feature, writer/director Rian Johnson has crafted a thrilling whodunit murder mystery that pays homage to the genre. Using a sharp screenplay and excellent ensemble of actors, Johnson keeps viewers entertained throughout the movie. The script is sharp, witty and comical, relying on dialogue to drive the story rather than action. Even when there's no action, the dialogue is so well-written that it keeps viewers immersed in the movie. In terms of acting, the entire cast is at the top of its game. Daniel Craig delivers one of the best performances of his career as detective Benoit Blanc. Sporting a Southern accent, he is charming, charismatic and utterly hilarious. Ana de Armas is equally engaging as the maid that is treated poorly by the chaotic family. With innocent expressions, she captures the emotions of a woman caught in a horrific situation. The final, most unforgettable standout in the cast is Chris Evans. As the despicable son of a wealthy patriarch, he brings hilarious comical relief and a sense of mischief to the film. Although \"Knives Out\" is extremely entertaining, ultimately it is not a film without flaws. At over two hours, it is slightly long and suffers from a lengthy running-time. It leaves viewers feeling entertained but at the same time exhausted. Nevertheless, fans of the murder mystery genre will definitely enjoy \"Knives Out\" and so will movie-goers seeking exhilarating entertainment this holiday season. They don't make murder mysteries like this anymore, but on those rare occasions that they do it's a cause for celebration.","displayName":"Hassan I","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1451588882/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T13:29:50.981Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T13:29:50.981Z","user":{"userId":"911164540","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hassan I","accountLink":"/user/id/911164540"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"A little slow in parts, but then good twists and turns.","displayName":"dnaulty","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T13:28:44.427Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T13:28:44.427Z","user":{"userId":"12E4A6EF-6298-40A7-B1B8-65D294C7CC5E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"dnaulty","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"With an extremely meticulous and self-conscious script that wastes none of its details, even the most insignificant ones, Rian Johnson's confident, humourous and utterly engaging directorial effort, a magnificent and comitted all-star cast (with Ana de Armas standing out with a note) and with rich political and social subtext, \"Knives Out\" effectively mixes a classic formula with modern elements to create one of the most entertaining and thought-provoking whodunit films ever made.","displayName":"Jos C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100004357213463/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T13:24:51.504Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T13:24:51.504Z","user":{"userId":"957240036","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jos C","accountLink":"/user/id/957240036"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie!
