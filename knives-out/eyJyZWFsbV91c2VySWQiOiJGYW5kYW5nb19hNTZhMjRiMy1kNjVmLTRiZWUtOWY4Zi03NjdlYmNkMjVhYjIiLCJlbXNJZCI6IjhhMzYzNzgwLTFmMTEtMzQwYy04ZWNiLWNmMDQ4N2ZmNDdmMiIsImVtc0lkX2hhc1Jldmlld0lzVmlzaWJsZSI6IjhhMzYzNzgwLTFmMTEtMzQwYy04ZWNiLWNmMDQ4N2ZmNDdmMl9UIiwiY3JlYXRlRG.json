Rain Johnson crafted something more than a whodunnit murder mystery and all involved seemed to be enjoying the subtle snark of their characters.  Notably Daniel Craig who seems to be channeling his Joe Bang role in Logan Lucky with the sweet tea drawl of his CSI KFC P.I. Benoit Blanc.  Who knew murder could be this fun?
