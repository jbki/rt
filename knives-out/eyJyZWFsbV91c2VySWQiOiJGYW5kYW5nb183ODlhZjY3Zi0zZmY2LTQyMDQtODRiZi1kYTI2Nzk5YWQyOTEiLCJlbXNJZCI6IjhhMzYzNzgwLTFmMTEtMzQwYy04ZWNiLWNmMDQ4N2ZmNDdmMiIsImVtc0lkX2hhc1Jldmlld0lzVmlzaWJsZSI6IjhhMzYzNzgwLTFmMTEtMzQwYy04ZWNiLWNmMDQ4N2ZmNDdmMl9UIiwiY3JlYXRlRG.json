Who didnt do it?! Colonel Mustard? Professor Plum? Mrs. Peacock? Oops, thats not right. It is right and not a spoiler to say its with a dagger in the victims study, multi-millionaire mystery author and patriarch Harlan Trombley (Christopher Plummer) on his 85th birthday. Youll learn that in the first five minutes. The rest of the film draws dotted guilt lines to every dysfunctional member of Trombleys family—until they are all tied up in maladjusted knots of inheritance entitlement. Knives Out is a ton of vampy and campy fun. Do not leave the theater though—not for a popcorn refill or candy fix or trip to the restroom—you will miss a critical clue. I guarantee it. If you can piece the maybe murder mystery puzzle together before films end, you are a better detective than I!
