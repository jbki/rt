It's a pretty good mystery movie. I thought they wrote Marta as if she was a child but the vomiting thing was funny. I didn't expect the ending so that's a plus. The actors did great. I did not like the \"SJW vs alt-right\" political crap they tried to force in but over all, thumbs up. If you like mysterys it would be a good addition to your collection.","displayName":"P G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-02T16:56:33.629Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T16:56:39.867Z","user":{"userId":"977464332","realm":"RT","displayName":"P G","accountLink":"/user/id/977464332"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Such a great plot.

Akin to watching someone make a sumptuous dessert while wearing a gas mask. A game cast and fine production design can't quite paper over a plot that is simultaneously convoluted and underwritten, with a surprising number of the a-listers left with nothing to do for astonishing lengths of time.","displayName":"Tiggle G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T16:27:32.094Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T16:27:32.094Z","user":{"userId":"3640d7e6-e9e0-4be9-a467-86761a6c1311","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tiggle G","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"}]}
