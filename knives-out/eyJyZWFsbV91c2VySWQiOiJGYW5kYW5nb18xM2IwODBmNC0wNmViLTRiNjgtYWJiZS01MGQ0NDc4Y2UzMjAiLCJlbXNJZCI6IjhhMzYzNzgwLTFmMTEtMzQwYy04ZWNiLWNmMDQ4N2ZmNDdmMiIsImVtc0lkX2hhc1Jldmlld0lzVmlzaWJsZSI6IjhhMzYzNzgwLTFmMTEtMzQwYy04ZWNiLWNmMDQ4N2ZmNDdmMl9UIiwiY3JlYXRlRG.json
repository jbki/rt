This film by Rian Johnson is an entertaining viewing experience. The cast, the music, the cinematography, and the mystery itself all come together nicely. The star power from Daniel Craig to Chris Evans to Jamie Lee Curtis all bring their A-Game to their respective roles. While being a murder mystery the film is also very comedic. The movie knows just how to set the tone for scenes and is a must watch for the year.","displayName":"Devin A.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-06T01:07:31.794Z","updateDate":"2019-12-06T01:07:31.794Z","user":{"userId":"B56EEDF4-F12D-4497-9905-9222070D0668","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Devin A.","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was very entertaining and funny","displayName":"jameson","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-06T01:02:29.573Z","updateDate":"2019-12-06T01:02:29.573Z","user":{"userId":"D84BD367-C078-4D0F-899F-4697011B02C1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"jameson","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fun take of the classic Who Done It.
