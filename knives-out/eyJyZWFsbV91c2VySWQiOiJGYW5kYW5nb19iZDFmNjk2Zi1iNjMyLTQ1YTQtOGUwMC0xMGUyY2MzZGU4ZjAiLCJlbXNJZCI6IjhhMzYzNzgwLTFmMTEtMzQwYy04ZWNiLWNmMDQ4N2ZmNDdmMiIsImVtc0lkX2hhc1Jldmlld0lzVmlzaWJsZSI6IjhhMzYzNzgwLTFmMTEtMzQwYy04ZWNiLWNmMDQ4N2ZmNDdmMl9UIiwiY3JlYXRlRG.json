Intelligent, with both stupid (good way) and brilliant humor, also deadly serious at times, plain fun. It straddles so many lines and never loses the golden heart driving it towards it's unforgettable conclusion. And my god what a conclusion (any Exile on Main St. fans must watch the whole movie to the start of the credits, trust me, you just might shed a tear). It has a lot to say (should I say, show) about the times and political climate we find ourselves in. But you don't have to watch it for that. There's a little bit of everything for everybody. All that the movie asks is for you to show up and actually watch it/pay attention, you will be rewarded one way or another.","displayName":"Dalton","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T04:11:47.058Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T04:11:47.058Z","user":{"userId":"ECA8ADDB-3AF8-4125-AD37-D08793893C4F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dalton","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Knives Out is a prime example of smart, erudite film making. It's also hugely enjoyable in the best possible way. This film is the latest creation from the fertile mind of Rian Johnson. Johnson has a way of making unique films that keep you on your toes through out. They are sharp and intelligent. They buzz and delight. This one is a murder mystery set in a wonderful mansion in Massachusetts. It's the home of hugely successful writer Harlan Thrombey, whose sudden death is ruled a suicide. When the family gather for a memorial police and a private detective join them to discover if the death was actually murder. What ensues is a meltdown of family relations as fingers are pointed and old enmities come to the surface. The Thrombey children are the epitome of privilege, many living off the largesse of Harlan. Seemingly their only goal is to see what they inherit in the will. It is definitely a murder mystery with a twist though, not really going down conventional paths. It all makes for a vastly entertaining time. Helped along by a heavyweight cast which includes Michael Shannon and Toni Colette. Special mention though should go to Lakeith Stanfield and Ana de Armas, whose characters are some of the few with any redeemable features. This is film making that is razor sharp. Plot twists and witty dialogue will keep you enthralled through out.","displayName":"Wayne M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/575378507/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T04:11:03.789Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T04:11:05.903Z","user":{"userId":"795201274","realm":"RT","displayName":"Wayne M","accountLink":"/user/id/795201274"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very very good murder mystery movie","displayName":"Vanessa T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/825302917913208/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T04:07:38.484Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T04:07:48.469Z","user":{"userId":"978416579","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vanessa T","accountLink":"/user/id/978416579"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Overrated, over-hyped, leaden film with an inane plot.
