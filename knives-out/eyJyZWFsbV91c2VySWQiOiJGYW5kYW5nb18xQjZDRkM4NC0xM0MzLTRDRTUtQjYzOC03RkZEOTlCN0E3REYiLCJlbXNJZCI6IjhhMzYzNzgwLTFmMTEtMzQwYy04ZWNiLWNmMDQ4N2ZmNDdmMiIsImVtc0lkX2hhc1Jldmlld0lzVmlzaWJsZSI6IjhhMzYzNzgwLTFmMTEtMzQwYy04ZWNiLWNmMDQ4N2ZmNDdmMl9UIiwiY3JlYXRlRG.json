I attempted to explain the plot and that we had seen the previews, but she seemed unimpressed. \n That opinion had changed by the time we both left the theatre. This movie was one of the best murder mysteries we have seen in a long time.  Usually by mid way through the movie , like The Good Liar,  my wife is whispering the right final outcome. But, this one had us both stumped.\nIt seemed mid way through the movie the director gave us all the answers.  It appeared like the movie had peaked.  It only got more intense.\nThe acting was great with a cast of well know actors. Jamie Lee Curtis (who has aged), Daniel Craig, Chris Evans to mention a few.  They all meshed together. Run, don't walk, to see this one folks.","displayName":"John A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1539781579/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T15:29:44.806Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T15:29:48.452Z","user":{"userId":"876950577","realm":"RT","displayName":"John A","accountLink":"/user/id/876950577"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The movie was a little slow moving along.
