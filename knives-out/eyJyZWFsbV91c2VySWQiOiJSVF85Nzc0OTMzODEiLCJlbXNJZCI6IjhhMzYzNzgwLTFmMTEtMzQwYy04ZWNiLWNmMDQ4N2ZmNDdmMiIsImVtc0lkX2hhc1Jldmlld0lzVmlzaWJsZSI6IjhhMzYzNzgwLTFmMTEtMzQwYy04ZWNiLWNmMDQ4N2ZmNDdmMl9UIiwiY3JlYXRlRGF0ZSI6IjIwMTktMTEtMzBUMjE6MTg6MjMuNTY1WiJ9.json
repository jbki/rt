A diatribe of nasty and ugly politics for Thanksgiving. If they thought this would draw crowds, the movie trailer would have presented the political agenda, but not one clip in the trailer reveals it. Very telling that they perceived millions would reject it if they knew the story was a rant against non-believers. Definitely rotten.","displayName":"Leslie W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001680181518/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T20:49:33.346Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T20:50:24.745Z","user":{"userId":"951160030","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leslie W","accountLink":"/user/id/951160030"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great actors, entertainment without nudity and cursing very refreshing.
