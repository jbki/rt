After seeing too many Marvel and Star Wars movies with our kids, and too many just ok movies when we go on dates, this was a welcome respite in entertainment. Our friends took their 13 and 15 year old sons to Knives Out. I asked the 13 year old what he thought. He replied, “Good, but too many words”. Haha! And they were great, well-written words. And no CGI explosions.
