I honestly never liked Captain America because of how nice he is. It always came off as phony to me. So it's nice to see Chris Evans portray the complete opposite.\nAnd secondly, how is it possible that the director of this amazing film made something as bad as The Last Jedi? Like, I genuinely don't understand how it's possible for someone to mess up so badly on one film, and yet make another film so damn good.","displayName":"Alex R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-02T21:38:35.256Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T21:38:39.997Z","user":{"userId":"977674477","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex R","accountLink":"/user/id/977674477"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"}]}
