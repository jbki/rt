Each actor is having a blast playing their role, and they get so many great chances, from iconic lines, to memorable reaction shots. Rian Johnson deftly tells a whodunnit, (or does he?), mixed in with the trappings of class, and the value of goodness. There are minor points where you truly wonder what the object of the price is, and where the film is driving, but it has an ending that more than makes up for it.","displayName":"Benn P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T20:56:47.994Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T20:56:53.255Z","user":{"userId":"830442131","realm":"RT","displayName":"Benn P","accountLink":"/user/id/830442131"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I honestly think this is the best movie of the year. An incredible homage to the genre, this whodunnit has everything an audience would love. Unexpectedly funny, and a perfect film to come out on Thanksgiving. I was lucky enough to get early screener tickets but I enjoyed it so much I think I may actually bring my family to see it again. Each cast member shines in their respective roles but Ana definitely steals the show. Definitely a must see!
