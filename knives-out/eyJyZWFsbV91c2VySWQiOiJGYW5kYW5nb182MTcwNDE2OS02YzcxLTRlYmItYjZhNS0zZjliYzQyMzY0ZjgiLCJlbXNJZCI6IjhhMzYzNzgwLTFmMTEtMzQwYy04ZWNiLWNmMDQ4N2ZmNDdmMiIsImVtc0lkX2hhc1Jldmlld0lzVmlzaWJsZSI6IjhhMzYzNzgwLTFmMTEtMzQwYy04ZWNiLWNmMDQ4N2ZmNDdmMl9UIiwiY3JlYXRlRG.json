The actors are superb across the board, with many playing against type, standouts being Daniel Craig as private detective Benoit Blanc (who comes off more bumbling than intelligent) while Chris Evans is nicely snarky as the spoiled grandson, Ranson, though might a a smidgen of a heart.  The star, though, is Ana de Armas, the kindly nurse who gets caught in the whole mess.  Behind the camera, writer/director Rian Johnson delivers a sharp murder mystery that makes fun of the conventions of the genre while not outright mocking.  There are plenty of twists and turns and just when you think you have things figured out, another one pops up turning everything on its head.  The movie is also surprisingly money, with ever character given a chance to shine (Craig's accent alone is brilliant).  Overall, one of the most entertaining movies of the year and perfect for Thanksgiving weekend.","displayName":"Johnathon W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/664155011/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T13:44:22.960Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T13:44:26.770Z","user":{"userId":"857932456","realm":"RT","displayName":"Johnathon W","accountLink":"/user/id/857932456"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"}]}
