No gratuitous sex or nude scenes......some language but not overly so.   We havent been to the theater in over a year because most movies now are constant explosions, overwhelming CGI and limited use of the vocabulary ( most of it f bombs every other word).

I don't want to say much about the plot, though, because I wouldn't want to spoil it for new viewers. I saw it first with a friend and liked it so much that I took my husband to see it the next day. He isn't much of a movie goer, but he liked it VERY much. I loved the way the story unfolded through the questioning of Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) I chuckled every time he spoke with his \"southern drawl.\"  How droll.","displayName":"Carrolle R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-10T14:20:48.221Z","updateDate":"2019-12-10T14:20:48.221Z","user":{"userId":"107932c3-07c0-4970-b0bd-192eff471b80","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Carrolle R","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great characters and plot, loved it!","displayName":"Joyce S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-10T14:20:07.499Z","updateDate":"2019-12-10T14:20:07.499Z","user":{"userId":"0A87AAA9-9EB4-4E3B-8975-B951B68A1CE5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joyce S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 10, 2019"}]}
