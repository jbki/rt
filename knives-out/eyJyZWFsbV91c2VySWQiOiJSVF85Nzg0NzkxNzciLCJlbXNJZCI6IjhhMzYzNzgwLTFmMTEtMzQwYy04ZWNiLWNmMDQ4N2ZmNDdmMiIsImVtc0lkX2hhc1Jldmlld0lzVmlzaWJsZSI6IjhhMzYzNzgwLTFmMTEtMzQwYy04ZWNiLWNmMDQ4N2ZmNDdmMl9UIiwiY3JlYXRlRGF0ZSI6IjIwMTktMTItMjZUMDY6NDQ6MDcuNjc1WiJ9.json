As a person who loves reading Agatha Christie novels, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I would suggest everyone to watch it. The first act kind of drags on but it contains a lot of clues, and the ending where they reveal the killer is absolutely bananas. This movie contains the right amount of comedy, tensions, thrill and is one of the best movies released in 2019.","displayName":"Yeshwanth R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2425995654178059/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T06:03:49.456Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T06:03:57.675Z","user":{"userId":"978479107","realm":"RT","displayName":"Yeshwanth R","accountLink":"/user/id/978479107"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Great mystery ‼️ glad we saw it!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T06:02:39.948Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T06:02:39.948Z","user":{"userId":"929159346","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/929159346"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great cast playing great characters.","displayName":"Alamobob","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T06:01:42.557Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T06:01:42.557Z","user":{"userId":"49C3D9B9-C275-44DB-840B-AC732530CAE7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Alamobob","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"}]}
