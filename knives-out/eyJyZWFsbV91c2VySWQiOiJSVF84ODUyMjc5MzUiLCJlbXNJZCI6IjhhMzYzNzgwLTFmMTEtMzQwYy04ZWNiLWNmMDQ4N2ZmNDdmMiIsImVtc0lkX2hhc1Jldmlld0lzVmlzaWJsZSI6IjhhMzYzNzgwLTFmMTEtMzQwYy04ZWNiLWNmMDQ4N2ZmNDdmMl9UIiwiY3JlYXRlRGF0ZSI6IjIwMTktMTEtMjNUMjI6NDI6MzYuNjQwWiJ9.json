Seeing that he was directing this, I went in with an open mind and not with a last jedi bias. I'm very happy to say, this film was terrific. I may not have forgiven Johnson for his last film, but he has my attention. \n\nThe cast in this movie was arguably the best cast in a movie this year. Honestly this movie wouldn't work as well without the cast. There were some very clever humorous moments that made me laugh. Chris Evans has a line in this movie that had me almost spitting out my drink in laughter. Every single performance in this movie worked. Everybody was so good in this movie as you'd expect them to be, ESPECIALLY Daniel Craig. My goodness, he just about ate this movie alive with his performance. Also, unlike Kong Skull Island, this movies A-List cast also has well written characters! Yay!! Back to the review, the whole mystery behind the movie was very well realized and when the film subverted our expectations, it worked this time! This movie wasted no time getting started with the central plot of the movie and once it got started, it never let up one second. You really have to pay attention to every last detail, and even though there is a lot to follow, the plot never felt cluttered. As opposed to the last jedi, Johnson wrote one really great whodunit story. Side note, seeing that a murder mystery has less twists in its plot than a star wars movie did is kind of funny but sad at the same time. \n\nMoving along, I don't have too many problems with this movie other than the fact that there is one character in this movie that is really just in it for comedic purposes. As well as a big plot detail that was forgotten about. Also for a murder mystery, it was kind of obvious early on who the killer was, it's just the plot did such a great job at putting all the puzzle pieces together that I didn't mind it all that much. \n\nRian Johnson made a great film that was much needed for me. After seeing the previous movies I reviewed back to back to back and none of them were GREAT, I needed this. I'm definitely curious to see what else Johnson does in the future behind a star wars trilogy I'm on the fence about. Definitely check this one out if you're a fan of the cast alone. I'm gonna give Knives Out, an A-","displayName":"Kyle A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T22:28:26.608Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T22:28:28.349Z","user":{"userId":"977683833","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kyle A","accountLink":"/user/id/977683833"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best movies of 2019 if not of the decade.

The film balances thriller and comedy in a way it gets best out of both. The characters are very colorful and memorable. Everyone is in their A-game, led by Daniel Craig and never better Ana de Armas. Set design is also amazing and the editing is top notch. A must see for all ''whodunit'' lovers and a big recommendation for everyone else. This film delivers in all platforms and so far, I'll place this film as my second favorite of 2019 (92 films and counting).","displayName":"Edward R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002101136683/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T22:12:56.827Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T22:13:34.902Z","user":{"userId":"920924075","realm":"RT","displayName":"Edward R","accountLink":"/user/id/920924075"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great movie!
