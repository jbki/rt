Didn't quite make the full 5 stars, as only a few characters were in depth and interesting enough, but apart from that there are very little flaws to be found here. Daniel Craig is a standout as the detective, and I'm hoping we get to see him solve more crimes in future films.","displayName":"Connor M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100007198181034/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T23:23:23.144Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T23:23:45.026Z","user":{"userId":"960955644","realm":"RT","displayName":"Connor M","accountLink":"/user/id/960955644"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"loved it.
