Spoilers ahead! The problem I have with the plot is I’m supposed to believe Harlan killed himself in one of the most gruesome and painful ways possible, without thinking through there would be a toxicology report. He gave Marta all these incredibly detailed instructions in his final 5 minutes but it didn’t occur to him the entire scheme falls apart when the medical examiner tests post mortem for drugs in his bloodstream? Which would most certainly be done in any situation where suicide or foul play were suspected. And really, Captain America duped this brilliant mystery writer on his 85th birthday into killing himself? I don’t think so! So here’s the only way I’m ok with the plot, which isn’t revealed at all in the movie. Instead of being duped Harlan knew full well what Ransom had done, and purposefully knocked over the Go board, so he could see/verify which bottle Marta had first. Once he knew she would be in the clear he went ahead with his preplanned suicide after again giving Marta the very detailed instructions on how not to get caught or be held responsible for an overdose (which he knew she didn’t administer). In the end it was an old man’s final joke on his family, and his last well penned murder mystery.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T01:32:18.289Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T01:32:18.289Z","user":{"userId":"926577329","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/926577329"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great.
