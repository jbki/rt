I find it very cool that a movie like this can come out in 2019. Whodunnit movies have a formula that they are supposed to stick to, always held together by one all-knowing Private Eye in the middle of the whole mess. While on paper this looks like it sticks to the formula, you'll quickly see how little it tries to be faithful to what whodunnits should be like. This is a movie that will surprise you within the first 20 minutes and will hook you for reasons you would not have expected. This may not be the best movie of 2019, but it was the most enjoyable movie I attended all year. It has surprising heart and plenty of twists and turns.","displayName":"Truett R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1297500092/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T23:01:08.730Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T23:01:14.632Z","user":{"userId":"909748388","realm":"RT","displayName":"Truett R","accountLink":"/user/id/909748388"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Extremely funny modern take that goes beyond and pays tribute to Clue/Murder She Wrote/Murder On The Orient Express with a great social commentary.
