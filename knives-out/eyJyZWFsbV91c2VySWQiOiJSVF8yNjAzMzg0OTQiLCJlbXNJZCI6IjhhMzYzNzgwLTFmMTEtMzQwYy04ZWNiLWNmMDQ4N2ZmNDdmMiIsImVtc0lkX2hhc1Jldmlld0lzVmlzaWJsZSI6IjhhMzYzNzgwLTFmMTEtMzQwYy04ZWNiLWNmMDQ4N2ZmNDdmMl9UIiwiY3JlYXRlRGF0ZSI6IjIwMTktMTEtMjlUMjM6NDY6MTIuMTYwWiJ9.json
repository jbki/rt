There are twists inside of twists and it's done in a way that's neither cheesy, corny or outlandish. It's a very down to earth film. There's a lot of talent in this film and it shows greatly. I would, personally, love for there to be a sequel, but it does stand firmly on its own. I would definitely see it again & I'd recommend to others to see this film.","displayName":"Ryan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T23:37:42.681Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T23:37:42.681Z","user":{"userId":"C62CE857-C7F0-4E1D-B9CC-9A478B538AA5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ryan","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Keeps your toes, very enjoyable given todayâ€™s horrible choices and movie let downs.","displayName":"Daniel","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T23:37:11.832Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T23:37:11.832Z","user":{"userId":"5E586888-8901-47E0-A8C0-48EF9437052E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Daniel","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie and cast.
