Some wonderful performances and some appropriately annoying ones. Memorable characters with excellent and funny dialogue.  An A for effort and a B for delivery. \n\nCriticisms are many -- way too long, a very short list of characters who could have actually committed the crime, a lot of irrelevant scenes and info, and the movie never quite functions as a whodunnit.","displayName":"Michael B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10220793862501532/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T20:19:18.073Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T20:19:22.956Z","user":{"userId":"978494839","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael B","accountLink":"/user/id/978494839"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"They don't make murder mysteries like this anymore. I loved the set design and the acting was great, particularly from Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig. The mystery itself was pretty good though some elements of the solution strained belief a little bit. There's also some kind of clunky identity politics stuff that took me out of the movie some.
