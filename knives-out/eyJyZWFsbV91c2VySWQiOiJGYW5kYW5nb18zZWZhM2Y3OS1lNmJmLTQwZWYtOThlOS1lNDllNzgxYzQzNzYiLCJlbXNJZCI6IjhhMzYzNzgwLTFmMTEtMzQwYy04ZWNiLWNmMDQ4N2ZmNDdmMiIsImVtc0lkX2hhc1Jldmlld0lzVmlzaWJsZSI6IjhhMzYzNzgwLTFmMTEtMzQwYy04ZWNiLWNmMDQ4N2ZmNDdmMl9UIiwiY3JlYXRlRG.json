A fantastic cast with Ana De Armas and Chris Evans stealing the scenes, a banging sweater, red herrings and doughnut holes.

Knives Out is a TRUE, genuine murder mystery whodunit that actually takes itself and the genre seriously. It's a comedy, but the comedy runs in tandem with the mystery rather than most modern whodunits which up play the comedy almost as if they're embarrassed to be a whodunit. The film is funny. The film is thrilling. The film is well-written. The film is well acted and well paced. The only issue I had with this is that (NO SPOILERS) the person or persons who did \"dun it\" felt too obvious to me and I wish they had done more to make it less obvious (for instance SPOILER--> they should have made the culprit a more sympathetic character to sort of get us the audience on their side instead of making them so unlikable and suspicious in the first place) That said, you barely notice this issue because the movie was so much fun leading up to it, so it didn't matter.","displayName":"critical m","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T20:53:50.199Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T20:53:58.299Z","user":{"userId":"971578654","realm":"RT","displayName":"critical m","accountLink":"/user/id/971578654"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"}]}
