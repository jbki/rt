Hilarious moments. Great acting. A little slow in the beginning, and I do feel like there were a few convenient times where plot devices were used to wrap up the working of events, like when the housekeeper suddenly had a cousin who worked at the blood lab. I also wanted Nana to suddenly speak, and have fooled them all!
