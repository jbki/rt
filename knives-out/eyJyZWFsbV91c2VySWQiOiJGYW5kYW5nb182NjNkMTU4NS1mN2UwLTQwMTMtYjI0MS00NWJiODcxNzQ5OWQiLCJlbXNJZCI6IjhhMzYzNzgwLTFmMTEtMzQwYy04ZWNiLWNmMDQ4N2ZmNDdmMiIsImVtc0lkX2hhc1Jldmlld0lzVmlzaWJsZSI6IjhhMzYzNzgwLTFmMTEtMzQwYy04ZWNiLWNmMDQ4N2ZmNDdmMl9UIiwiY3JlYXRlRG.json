As a fan of mysteries and 'who dunnit' I thought it was very well done and reminded me of an Agatha Christie murder mystery. Wasn't quite sure if I liked Daniel Craig with a Southern American drawl but must admit he did a good job (as a fellow Brit I could not detect any British accent from him).  Overall a very good movie.","displayName":"Andrea P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10153246490046816/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T19:47:10.067Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T19:47:25.242Z","user":{"userId":"973409560","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrea P","accountLink":"/user/id/973409560"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Lots of fun, not very serious","displayName":"stephen m","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T19:44:47.329Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T19:44:47.329Z","user":{"userId":"938CFFD3-21D1-4C91-891D-69CFBB936B0B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"stephen m","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great film, went in expecting to see a predictable plot with slightly interesting characters but while watching the movie I was pleasantly surprised. 8/10.","displayName":"Parke E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T19:44:33.284Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T19:44:33.284Z","user":{"userId":"A0C8417C-20BB-4B03-B65B-DD285F961C17","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Parke E","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fabulous.
