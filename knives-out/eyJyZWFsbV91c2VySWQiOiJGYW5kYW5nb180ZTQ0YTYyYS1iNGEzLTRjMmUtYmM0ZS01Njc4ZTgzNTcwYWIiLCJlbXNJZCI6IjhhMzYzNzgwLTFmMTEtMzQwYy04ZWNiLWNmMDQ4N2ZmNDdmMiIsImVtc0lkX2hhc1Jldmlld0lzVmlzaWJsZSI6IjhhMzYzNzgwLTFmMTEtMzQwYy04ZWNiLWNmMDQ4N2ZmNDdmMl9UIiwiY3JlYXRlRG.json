The reveal shows/mentions things not seen onscreen, so piecing it together in real time as the movie reaches denouement is anticlimactic. Great cast, funny moments. Seemed Russell Crowe would have been more natural choice for part than Daniel Craig-whose dialect seemed strained, but was passable. Overall great acting, but movie expectation was higher.","displayName":"SAM","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T02:02:35.544Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T02:02:35.544Z","user":{"userId":"1b4ada3e-8a46-414c-b0a9-961163500810","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"SAM","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Pretty good but could have been much better. \nAlso, as with nearly every movie these days .
