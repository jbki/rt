While no one in the cast did a \"OMG\" standout performance, everyone handled everything particularly well... with one minor exception.\n\nPerhaps, it's knowing Daniel Craig from other films that makes the choice of him using the accent he uses in Knives Out to come off as terribly forced and completely unnecessary. His job here isn't really bad, just more than a bit noticeable... once you become acclimated to it, you can ignore it. It does remain a minor annoyance.\n\nRian Johnson did a great job writing and directing what could be a new classic in this genre. I found it fun, compelling - with enough twists and enough laughs to keep me thoroughly entertained.\n\nOne drawback is the movie's length. The movie started to feel a bit long towards the end and there is some fat that can be trimmed to make Knives Out a bit more streamlined and a more smoother ride.","displayName":"John D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/594490288/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T04:29:02.522Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T04:29:08.765Z","user":{"userId":"878547547","realm":"RT","displayName":"John D","accountLink":"/user/id/878547547"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Old fashioned whodunnit.
