The patriarch of a spoiled family (Christopher Plummer) is found dead on his 85th birthday and, of course, everyone has a motive. Enter a debonair Southern detective (Daniel Craig chewing up that accent) to solve the case. Chris Evans is especially enjoyable as the haughty, hateful grandson, while Toni Collette's new age entrepreneur is a hoot. (It's also a treat to see Frank Oz as the attorney.) The mystery keeps surprising right up til the end with lots of smart dialogue and stylish direction by Rian Johnson.","displayName":"Jerry W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T15:44:57.196Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T15:44:58.764Z","user":{"userId":"978205059","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jerry W","accountLink":"/user/id/978205059"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Hilarious I laughed throughout the whole movie!","displayName":"Adam  M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T15:42:13.216Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T15:42:14.873Z","user":{"userId":"977690109","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adam  M","accountLink":"/user/id/977690109"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Knives Out is an OK film....96% is way too high.
