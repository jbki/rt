There are many parts where the movie had me laughing out loud. The story telling was great and the writing had me immersed in their world.\n\nDislikes: The Politics broke my immersion multiple times causing me to roll my eyes on several occasions. It felt force fed and out of place. This was really the only issue I had with the movie. I remember telling my wife that I would like to watch one movie that didnt push the \"us vs. them\" mentality. It's okay to use it to help the narrative but it leaned on the subjects so hard that I couldn't help but think, \"okay, let's move on with the story.\"","displayName":"Cameron L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2328779870479090/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T18:46:57.145Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T18:47:26.956Z","user":{"userId":"977886557","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cameron L","accountLink":"/user/id/977886557"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"light and entertaining","displayName":"Michael D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T18:44:57.475Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T18:44:57.475Z","user":{"userId":"b22e9091-7e74-460c-b80f-4115e2417486","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael D","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Such a fantastic murder mystery.","displayName":"Marcus","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T18:44:50.803Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T18:44:50.803Z","user":{"userId":"B296F368-DA90-4D3A-B0B2-97E1C17BFCA5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Marcus","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great murder mystery!","displayName":"Angelica A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T18:43:03.002Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T18:43:03.002Z","user":{"userId":"0BD1A4DB-915A-4A65-A54A-47832E7FB210","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Angelica A","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie experience","displayName":"Jose","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T18:37:34.055Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T18:37:34.055Z","user":{"userId":"1F934C3A-17AF-452D-9917-29E59B074961","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jose","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great story, terrific acting and yes, theres a twist.","displayName":"Kate","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T18:35:42.448Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T18:35:42.448Z","user":{"userId":"d99946cd-b124-4b52-954a-8d8d8cc0c770","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kate","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This movie was written well! my early guesses were wrong, but I'm glad I didnt guess right.
