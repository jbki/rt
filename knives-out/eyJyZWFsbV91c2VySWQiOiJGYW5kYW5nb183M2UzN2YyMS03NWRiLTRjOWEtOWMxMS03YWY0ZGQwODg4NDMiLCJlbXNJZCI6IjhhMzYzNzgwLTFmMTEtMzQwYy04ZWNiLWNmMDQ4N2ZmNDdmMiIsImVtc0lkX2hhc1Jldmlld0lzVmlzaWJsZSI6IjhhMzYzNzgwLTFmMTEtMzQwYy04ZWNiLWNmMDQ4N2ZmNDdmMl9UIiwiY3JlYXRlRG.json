Great cast and the acting is superb. Loved the cinematography, some shots were just plain beautiful (as to be expected from Rian Johnson). The writing was superb and while it lacked a true twist, it still kept my attention through to the end (with some fault in the middle). I might need to rewatch to pay more attention to the score, but the first track was sublime and the violin sounded amazing. Highly recommend this film!","displayName":"Donald H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T02:23:01.429Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T02:23:12.091Z","user":{"userId":"977988380","realm":"RT","displayName":"Donald H","accountLink":"/user/id/977988380"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"I thought it wasn't that good at all.  First, it was directed by Rian Johnson, who directed possibly the worst Star Wars picture of all time.\n\nSecond, it has Daniel Craig of British 007 fame playing a Southern gentleman detective with a French last name in America solving a case that he was never assigned to.  He was hired by someone he never knows (until the end of the movie).  He just takes the case, never thinking of who hired him, why they hired him, etc.\n\nPast that, there were just so many other things that simply didn't make sense.  On a scale from 1-10, I give it 3-4.  I wouldn't even bother watching this if/when it comes on TV.  You would spend your time better renting the 80's (I believe) mystery comedy Clue and watching it at home.","displayName":"Steve S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T02:21:48.788Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T02:21:57.266Z","user":{"userId":"974483677","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steve S","accountLink":"/user/id/974483677"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Fun and successfully comedic with twists to die for.... literally.","displayName":"Tessa T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T02:20:55.983Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T02:21:00.413Z","user":{"userId":"978250142","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tessa T","accountLink":"/user/id/978250142"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wonderful film: perfect cast and fun screenplay.

This movie is sitting at 92% audience score as this is being written. That seems too high for a good but not great movie; perhaps the score is reflective of the string of duds Hollywood has been trotting out this year. The trailer highlighted many of the comedic moments in the film, which was a touch misleading. It could be argued that \"misleading\" is kind of the point in this sort of story. Motives are established as well as the underlying greed that we plebs can imagine swirls around the reading of wills of the fabulously wealthy. Some of the call backs in the movie don't make a lot of sense - wouldn't you stop wearing shoes when you noticed blood on them? - and one feels like it is a set up all the way through. It is hard to imagine why they wanted Daniel Craig to attempt a Southern accent when his character could just have easily been British. Craig's natural accent would have been much preferred to the jarring dialect he does at least maintain throughout. There are unnecessary nods to leftist talking points, primarily around immigration, that reduce some characters to caricatures. All of that said, it is a different sort of movie. It is worth seeing, though nothing about the visuals is compelling enough to merit going to the theater.","displayName":"Ron F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T01:53:21.882Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T01:53:31.762Z","user":{"userId":"977516605","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ron F","accountLink":"/user/id/977516605"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Knives out was ok but then I can never figure out the \"villain.
