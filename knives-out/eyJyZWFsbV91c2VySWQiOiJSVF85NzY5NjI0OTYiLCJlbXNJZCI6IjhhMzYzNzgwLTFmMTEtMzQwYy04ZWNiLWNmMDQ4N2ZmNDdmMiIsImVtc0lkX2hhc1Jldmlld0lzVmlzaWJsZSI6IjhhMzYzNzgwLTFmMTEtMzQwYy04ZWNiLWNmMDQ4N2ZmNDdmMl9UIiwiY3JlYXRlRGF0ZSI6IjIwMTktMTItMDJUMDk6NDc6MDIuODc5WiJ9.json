However, the story line was too typical and predictable.  The ending with the immigrant women standing at the top with the wealthy family at the bottom was too much of a social statement as opposed to a murder mystery.  Just because youre a migrant it doesnt make you good and just because youre rich it doesnt make you bad.  Too much stereotyping and if it was a social statement the movie wanted to make.  Please pick another genre.","displayName":"Faye","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T09:25:07.402Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T09:25:07.402Z","user":{"userId":"e0d083ae-bdc9-448c-b9fd-5b47e6e40271","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Faye","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Masterfully constructed, with clever social commentary and solid portion of dark homour.","displayName":"Adam R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000739815804/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T09:08:40.103Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T09:08:44.291Z","user":{"userId":"910697941","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adam R","accountLink":"/user/id/910697941"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Not your average who-done-it.

Spectacular performances from de armas,Craig,and evans.And powerful messages covered by a witty script.\n\nJohnson delivers a whodunnit that's worthy of standing on the shelves next to Christie and Doyle. A suspenseful murder mystery that will keep audience guessing till the end.

Or at least as close as anyone is ever going to get. This all star cast absolutely throws themselves into this movie, with no hesitation, the leads bounce off one another perfectly. Great pacing, intriguing plot and a perfect payoff at the end, what more is there you want. My only problem was, as a Bond fan, Craig's accent slightly takes you out of it, but that is no fault of his. Really, do yourself a favour and watch this brilliant film!!","displayName":"Ronan S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T08:32:38.063Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T08:32:42.816Z","user":{"userId":"978194023","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ronan S","accountLink":"/user/id/978194023"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This film is one of the most cleaver and great films from the last few years!!
