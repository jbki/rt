There were multiple leads throughout the story to provide misdirect and evasion. While it was only a couple of hours long, each one had me gripped in the depths of the interplay between characters. That made it feel longer, but I did not kind whatsoever because it felt as if I were walking in pace with the investigation. The reveal was more than I could have hoped for. And well worth every moment. It was a wonderful mental exercise the likes that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would be green with envy over.
