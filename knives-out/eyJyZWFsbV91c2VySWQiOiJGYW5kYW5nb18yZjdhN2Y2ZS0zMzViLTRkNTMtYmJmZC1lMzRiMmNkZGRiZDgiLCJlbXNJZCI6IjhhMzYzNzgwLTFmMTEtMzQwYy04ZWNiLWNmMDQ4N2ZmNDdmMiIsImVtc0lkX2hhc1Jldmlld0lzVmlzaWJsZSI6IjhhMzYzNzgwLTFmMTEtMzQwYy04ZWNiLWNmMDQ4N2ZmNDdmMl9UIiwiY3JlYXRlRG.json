It was a little hard to listen to Daniel Craig's accent, but as a southerner, I just put him in the Louisiana Bayou country to try to deal with it.  But his acting was superb!  Knives Out was not a clumsy parody although, I was a little ahead of the movie curve in figuring it out.  The invisible ink, the sympathetic black sheep, the housekeeper \"death\".  What I couldn't figure out were the youngest characters' parts in this.  Meg was way too feely, and the \"masturbating Nazi\" seemed very superfluous.  Neither added to the story, and both parts provided way too obvious information that could have been delivered elsewise.","displayName":"Regi D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-09T14:05:43.207Z","updateDate":"2019-12-09T14:05:43.207Z","user":{"userId":"f13b7f65-a7e3-458b-80b0-1dfd3a1294f3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Regi D","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"VERY SMART AND WELL-ACTED","displayName":"Patricia H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-09T14:05:34.073Z","updateDate":"2019-12-09T14:05:34.073Z","user":{"userId":"52a04b71-3768-434a-96fa-0e2e4c3286e7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Patricia H","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It was entertaining albeit a bit predictable.","displayName":"Natasha","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-09T14:01:29.144Z","updateDate":"2019-12-09T14:01:29.144Z","user":{"userId":"92c1fbea-b40f-4985-a297-63280cb9ba17","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Natasha","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Surprisingly funny as well as engaging.
