It was funny, gripping and over all lovable. It can be obvious who the killer is pretty early on but the ride to find out how was far more entertaining than people give credit to.\n\nThe acting was incredibly fresh. Everyone did an amazing job but extra love to Daniel Craig, Toni Collette and Chris Evans. It was great to see them have so much fun with the characters.\n\nThe visuals were consistently great and some of the camera work had me very excited. Specifically when: *out of context spoiler* Marta was overwhelmed. The movement embodied her feelings so well. \n\nThe resolution felt incredibly rewarding and had me proud. \n\nI would definitely recommend this. Just know it's not as much of a 'who done it' as advertised and that it's a tad slow. However, the parts that were slow the character dynamics definitely made up for.","displayName":"Sofia R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T04:35:34.971Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T04:35:34.971Z","user":{"userId":"978290188","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sofia R","accountLink":"/user/id/978290188"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It was pretty good.
