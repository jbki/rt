This is a fun film with good plot twists and it manages to entertain.\n\nOn the plus side, most characters are well defined and cast. The actors do great jobs, the plot weaves intricately enough to keep you guessing most of the time, and gives constant surprises. Set design and cinematography are excellent.\n\nOn the downside, the re-watch value is null, just as it is for something like sixth sense that depends entirely on surprise. And while the actors do a great job in their characters, especially Daniel Craig with his southern drawl, the script bloviates at length. The film could easily have been twenty minutes shorter.\n\nAs is also usual with Rian Johnson, the film is full of political jabbing. But at least it makes sense in the dysfunctional family setting and doesn't remove you from the immersion experience.","displayName":"Demian A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/649426118/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T18:52:53.031Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T18:53:04.684Z","user":{"userId":"909446580","realm":"RT","displayName":"Demian A","accountLink":"/user/id/909446580"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"I think it was way too boring..they could have cut 30 minutes out of the monotony and still have told the story, plus I could have done without the political overtones.","displayName":"Donna C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2568102336801348/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T18:51:38.890Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T18:51:57.285Z","user":{"userId":"978416051","realm":"RT","displayName":"Donna C","accountLink":"/user/id/978416051"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was great for the whole family.
