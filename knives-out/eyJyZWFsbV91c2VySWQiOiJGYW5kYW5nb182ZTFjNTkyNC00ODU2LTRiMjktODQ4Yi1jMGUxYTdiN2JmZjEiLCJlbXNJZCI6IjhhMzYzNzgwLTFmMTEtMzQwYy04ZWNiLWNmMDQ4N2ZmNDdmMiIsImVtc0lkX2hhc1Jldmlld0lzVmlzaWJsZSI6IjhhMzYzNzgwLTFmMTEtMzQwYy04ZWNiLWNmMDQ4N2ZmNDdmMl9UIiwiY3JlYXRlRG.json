BUT, it actually gave the viewer time to formulate their own theories during the plot development. The effect was not feeling overwhelmed while at the same time being well informed to have all the clues easily comprehended, and at the same time the pace felt fast, thrilling and enjoyable. The culprit was well masked until the final reveal.
