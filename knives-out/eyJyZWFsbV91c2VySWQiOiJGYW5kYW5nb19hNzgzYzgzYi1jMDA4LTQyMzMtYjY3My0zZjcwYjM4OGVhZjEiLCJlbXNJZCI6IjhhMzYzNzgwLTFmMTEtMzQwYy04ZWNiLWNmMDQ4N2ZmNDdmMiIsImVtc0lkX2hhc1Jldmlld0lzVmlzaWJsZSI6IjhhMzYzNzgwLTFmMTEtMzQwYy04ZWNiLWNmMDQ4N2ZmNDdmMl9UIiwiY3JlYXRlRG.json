Rian Johnson did a great job with this one. I'm not the biggest Johnson fan (see: The Last Jedi) but I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was incredible (shout-out to Ana DeArmas and Daniel Craig!), the cinematography was gorgeous, the story was great, and the final twist of the knife at the end was great. My only grievance against this movie is that the pacing feels slightly off during the interrogation scene at the very beginning, but it effectively sets up the story, and once Daniel Craig's character introduces himself, the movie really gets going. What a great movie!","displayName":"Ella M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/169373854284250/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:07:42.492Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:07:49.982Z","user":{"userId":"978483577","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ella M","accountLink":"/user/id/978483577"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I thought it was a little slow to get rolling however, most of my family (very solid film critics) disagreed.
