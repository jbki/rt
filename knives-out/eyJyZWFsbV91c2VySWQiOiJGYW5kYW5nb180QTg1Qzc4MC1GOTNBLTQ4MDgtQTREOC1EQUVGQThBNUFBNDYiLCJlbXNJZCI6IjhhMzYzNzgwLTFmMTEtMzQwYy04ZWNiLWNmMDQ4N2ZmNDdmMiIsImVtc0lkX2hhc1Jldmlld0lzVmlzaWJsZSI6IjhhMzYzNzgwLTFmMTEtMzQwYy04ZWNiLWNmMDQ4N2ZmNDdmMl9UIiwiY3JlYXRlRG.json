This star-studded whodunit keeps what the previews promise: a twisted (and twisted again, following yet another red herring, just before folding back on itself) crime story filled with humorous bits by many different characters.

This movie was bold, hilarious, and shocking. Chris Evans, Toni Collette, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Daniel Craig were terrific, and Christopher Plummer and Ana de Armas were also outstanding. To be honest, everyone in the movie did amazing and if I were to list every great person, I would have gone through the entire cast! Terrific movie by Rian Johnson!
