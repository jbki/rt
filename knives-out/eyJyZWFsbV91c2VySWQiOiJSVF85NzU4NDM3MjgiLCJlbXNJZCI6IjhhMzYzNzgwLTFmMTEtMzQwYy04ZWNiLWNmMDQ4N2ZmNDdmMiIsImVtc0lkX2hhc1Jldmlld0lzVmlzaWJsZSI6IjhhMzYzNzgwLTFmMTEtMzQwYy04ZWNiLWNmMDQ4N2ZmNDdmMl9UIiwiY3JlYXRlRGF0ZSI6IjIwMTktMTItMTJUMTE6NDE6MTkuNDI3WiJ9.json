It was a death in a big house with a number of people with apparent motives and there was a detective with a french-ish name but that is where the comparison ends.\n I have a few rules when it comes to mysteries 1: don't give the audience information you don't give the detective. 2: don't make the villain so obvious that the audience can tell who it is before the detective does, and 3: don't make the answer so opaque that when the detective explains it at the end you can't follow his reasoning. This movie broke the first two within the first half hour, helpfully providing us, the audience with flashbacks of  honest answers to exactly what the suspects were lying about. Ten to fifteen minutes in I leaned over to my friend and made a prediction about the \"murder\" he responded with an addendum to my theory. A few minutes later we got yet another flashback that showed exactly what happened and how the person in question ended up dead My friend and I had The Who though admittedly not the exact how. But wait there's more. Because the movie isn't over yet. There is a villain we've not yet considered. Someone who enters the room practically twirling a mustache or cackling maniacally. He walked in the room and I said \"oh, so he's the bad guy then.\" \n This of course proved to be true. The movie then played itself out with the only real questions being 1: why anyone even cares since forensic evidence solved the case before the movie started and 2: how anyone would expect a movie so full of on point political commentary to pass the test of time. Ten years from now nobody's gonna care about a movie mystery with an obvious answer and an on screen twitter fighter that includes a boy calling a girl an SJW and her responding by calling him an alt right troll.\n Agatha Christie on the other hand writes mysteries that are challenging and as fun to read today as they were a hundred years ago. For anyone looking not to waste an evening I recommend skipping Knives Out and reading a book instead.","displayName":"Cara L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1566227811/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-12T08:59:53.321Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T08:59:59.462Z","user":{"userId":"912560821","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cara L","accountLink":"/user/id/912560821"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Like Clue but in real life","displayName":"Anon","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T08:42:32.879Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T08:42:32.879Z","user":{"userId":"617BEAED-AB32-4045-9193-36B2DE866683","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Anon","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great fun with a wonderful cast","displayName":"Emi","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T07:48:05.494Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T07:48:05.494Z","user":{"userId":"82C7F04A-9799-4746-A28D-7C4541955E49","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Emi","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Kept me on my toes.
