A must see for the mystery buff. The movie moved along nicely and took you with it. It is well made and has a great story line. I really liked the twist near the end because I didn't see it coming. I was drawn in by the clue like story, I love the game but the movie of the same name was a total bust, hated it. I was hoping this was not going to be similar and was wonderfully surprised that it wasn't.
