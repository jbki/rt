A large portion of the cast eventually becomes completely inconsequential to the plot.\nNone of the characters are given backstories and no given information was enough to make me care about them.\nAll the so-called \"twists and turns\" fall flat and the element of surprise played no part in the viewing experience.\nI won't deny that it has entertaining elements, but the only way for me to enjoy these was to completely disregard about 80% of the movie.\nThis is my opinion and if you disagree with it I genuinely wish I could see it the way you do.","displayName":"Arthur W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-06T13:39:50.563Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T03:39:25.351Z","user":{"userId":"978030602","realm":"RT","displayName":"Arthur W","accountLink":"/user/id/978030602"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 06, 2019"}]}
