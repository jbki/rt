I think you’ll either love it or hate it.  Great cast and a slick script.  It’s shot beautifully.  Just an all-around neatly made film.  People are comparing it to Clue, but I disagree.  Clue was slapstick comedy a la Mel Brookes.  This is a little subtler. Not so in your face.  It’s got a nice mix.  And for mystery fans it’s a clever little whodunit.  It starts off like a classic Agatha Christie then midway feels more Columbo.  But there’s a clever twist and in the end it’s a pretty fair-play mystery and not too convoluted.  It is a little slow in parts but I find most mysteries tend to have this lag due to a lot of set up and clues etc.  But in the end the cast looks like they’re having fun and it’s just a neat film to experience.","displayName":"Dennis P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T21:45:39.976Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T21:45:39.976Z","user":{"userId":"522D1916-7790-404D-94E1-DD6FA005D365","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dennis P","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Predictable but fun.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T21:45:26.812Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T21:45:26.812Z","user":{"userId":"962985352","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/962985352"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I liked the characters","displayName":"Ana","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T21:36:26.942Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T21:36:26.942Z","user":{"userId":"665A1602-19A9-4544-B2FB-D17E7D9235CC","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ana","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Just good old fashion “who done it” movie.
