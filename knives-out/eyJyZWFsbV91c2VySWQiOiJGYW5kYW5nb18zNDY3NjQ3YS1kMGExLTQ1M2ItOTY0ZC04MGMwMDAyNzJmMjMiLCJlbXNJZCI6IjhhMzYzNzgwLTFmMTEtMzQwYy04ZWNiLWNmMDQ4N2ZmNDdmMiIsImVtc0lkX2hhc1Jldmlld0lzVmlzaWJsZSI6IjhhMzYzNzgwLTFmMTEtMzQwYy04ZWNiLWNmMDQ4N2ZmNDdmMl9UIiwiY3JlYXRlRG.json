He tries so hard to get his own personal messages forced down your throat but unlike last jedi he he doesn’t sacrifice the entire movie for his political messaging. There’s just enough actual storytelling here to save the politics and try-hard, unnecessary plot twists. The entire movie is saved by an average last 20 minutes.","displayName":"Joe C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T16:15:42.193Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T16:15:42.193Z","user":{"userId":"A9C85672-02D4-47BD-AD37-19D3763EBDA0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joe C","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"My expectations were too high.
