Guys I have to be honest with y'all: he's got to be one of the best, if not the best, filmmaker of this generation. I can easily see Knives Out to be an instant classic next to Brick and Looper.","displayName":"Michael O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-13T06:02:15.075Z","updateDate":"2019-12-13T06:09:50.235Z","user":{"userId":"977634677","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael O","accountLink":"/user/id/977634677"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Was expecting a repetition of a whodunnit style murder mystery with a cast of higher budget. Only watched because I heard good comments on it from my friends. We start off with the discovery of the dead body- followed by interviews with each of the family members present that night- all an expected tale. Each member has a motive for killing(as per usual) and we are introduced to the party to is supposed to tie it all with her close relations to the deceased and who conveniently cannot lie. We now see a different sight to that night and suddenly we realise everyone else seems to be innocent if her recount is indeed true. It cannot be that easy right? More mysteries inundate our way, causing us to anticipate twists - doubting whether somewhere along the way there might be unreliable narrators. I leave you to it, but I must say the revelations were steered pretty well- not too draggy and not forced at the same time. A fantastic job to Director Rian and his producers!","displayName":"Leonard T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10207114867068880/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-13T06:01:18.050Z","updateDate":"2019-12-13T06:01:26.663Z","user":{"userId":"976276701","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leonard T","accountLink":"/user/id/976276701"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I absolutely loved this movie since the first moment, very good plot, the cast amazing, funny, and original.

That's not a knock on Rian Johnson's abilities as a writer, I'm just perceptive haha\n\nI would have loved another twist to throw me off in the end, but that would have been a little too passé these days I imagine.\n\nI loved Rian Johnson's work. I've been keeping an eye out for him in film ever since someone left a copy of Brick in my living room one night after a college party. I still have that same copy, too. I nearly shit myself when I saw his name as director on a few of my favorite episodes of Breaking Bad.\n\nAnd my last bit of praise his way: Best originality in Star Wars since Empire.
