Some A list actorrs and a few has-beens...was pretty boring and rambling though.  My husband and I fell asleep a couple of times.  We left early to beat the foot traffic.  2020 may be a movie-less year for me.  Cant pay high ticket prices anymore to see constant remakes, respins, movies avout old singers and wishy-washy yarns like this.

In this case, in a self-contained murder-comedy where he can do no damage to a pre-established franchise, Johnson gets the job done.\n\nI found myself enjoying the mystery. I found myself chuckling whenever Daniel Craig opened his mouth (not since Foghorn Leghorn has there been an antebellum accent like this--and the fact it's coming out of James Bond's mouth makes it even funnier). True, Johnson does take a few pot shots at Trump, Trump followers and the Right in general, but he also smears the SJW Left as well, so it sort of balances out. The cast does a great job of playing these ridiculous characters, with Michael Shannon and Chris Evans doing especially well (I was kind of hoping for a General Zod/Captain America fight). \n\nSo, Knives Out isn't the disaster I was hoping it would be.  It is on the long side, and I did find myself checking my watch on occasion. There are plenty of twists--but you're pretty much expecting lots of twists so when they come they aren't a surprise. If you're in the mood for a harmless murder-mystery, this one might be for you.","displayName":"Ren G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-11-29T22:17:15.301Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T22:17:18.759Z","user":{"userId":"977652235","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ren G","accountLink":"/user/id/977652235"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Going in my Top 10 favourite movies.

But, it quickly changed pace and Daniel Craig's accent became believable.  It was truly a \"who done it\" and we were wrong in guessing each time we changed out minds about who the culprit was.  And, it was a big surprise!  Highly recommend Knives Out.","displayName":"linda h","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T22:15:15.393Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T22:15:15.393Z","user":{"userId":"c3240e96-3156-4b51-8b99-dbd61ee75475","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"linda h","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"An updated spin of the mystery & suspense movie fresh for the 2020's, Knives Out is clever, original, and with a brain scrambler of a cast that includes James Bond, Captain America, Laurie Strode, and Sonny Crockett which all combined with the rest of the all-star cast to leave some movie goers delirious and overwhelmed and unable to control their laughter throughout and keep from making a spectacle of their selves.\n\n- 1/2 point(9 1/2 of 10) because no movie is perfect until it convinces me it might be.  \n\n- 1/2 point(9 of 10) because the 'whodunit' of it all is resolved rather early and while it tries to unfold into another more complex 'whodunit' it doesn't quite get there.\n\n- 1/2 point (8 1/2 of 10) because the plot and unfolding of the mystery within a mystery isn't quite as clever as it wants to lead audiences to believe.  The twist that you're waiting for never really twists all the way around and it kinda ends half-open like a bag of cookies someone didn't twist shut all the way.    \n\n- 1/2 point (8 of 10) because... the cast was great in this, as expected, and they were the highlight of this movie but... it was almost too much screen presence for one movie and hard to digest and mentally process and that really exposes how relatively ordinary the plot and story in this 'whodunit'  mystery  for the 2020's were if your mind isn't totally twisted by this loaded cast.\n\n8 of 10(4 of 5 for RT purposes)\n\nReally is a perfect movie for Thanksgiving weekend, whatever that is.  I feel about this how I felt about Bad Times at the El Royale a couple years.  A movie I actually appreciated a tad more at home, so we'll see what happens with this.","displayName":"Jeffrey P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T22:14:15.475Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T15:03:01.029Z","user":{"userId":"976433996","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeffrey P","accountLink":"/user/id/976433996"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Could be a little talkative at times, but overall a nice “who done it” movie.","displayName":"Mickel C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T22:13:23.224Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T22:13:23.224Z","user":{"userId":"A78D2D34-9423-41A7-A28B-B40A82CA8962","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mickel C","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Humour, thrills and plot twists right up until the very last moment.
