Knives Out Movie Tavern W 7th Part of a Pizza & a Dr. Pepper BLUF: This movie is absolutely fantastic & you need to drop what you are doing & go see it. Knives Out is the story of a family patriarch who mysteriously dies the night of his 85th birthday & the ins & outs of his maniacal family as they are interrogated by detectives attempting to piece together his death. It’s incredibly well written in the spirit of Clue, The Usual Suspects, Murder on the Orient Express, et al. Every person in it is fantastic. Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Chris Evans, Michael Shannon & Daniel Craig headline. It’s hilarious, clever & I had no idea what was going on until the very end. You’ll thank me later. 9/10, A See in theater, 13+","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T04:40:55.316Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T04:40:55.316Z","user":{"userId":"946972809","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/946972809"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Really enjoyed this movie and the storyline","displayName":"Samantha B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T04:38:39.946Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T04:38:39.946Z","user":{"userId":"36f26dd3-c35b-49c4-9c50-8f5381a7eac7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Samantha B","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent Whodunnit!
