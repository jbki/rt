This movie does a poor job in keeping that a secret, and while I didn't like that I appreciated that at least the explanation was very complex and made the movie worth watching. Is this overhyped? Yes. If you soften your expectations you will have a good time. There's two performances that stand out in this film. First, Daniel Craig in the lead role, and his performance especially how his characters speaks and processes things is great. Also, Chris Evans does such a wonderful job playing a character who is an absolute a-hole (Much different than Captain America!), and is quite entertaining. Ana De Armas does an okay job, the rest of the cast isn't provided too much of a chance to shine. The film could've been paced better, but overall I think it is done well and the narrative makes sense. It requires some thinking (duh!). I think this is an enjoyable film that most people will have fun at especially if you like whodunnits, and I think it would be worth the price of admission.","displayName":"Caleb B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-19T00:14:51.268Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T00:14:55.196Z","user":{"userId":"977898721","realm":"RT","displayName":"Caleb B","accountLink":"/user/id/977898721"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"}]}
