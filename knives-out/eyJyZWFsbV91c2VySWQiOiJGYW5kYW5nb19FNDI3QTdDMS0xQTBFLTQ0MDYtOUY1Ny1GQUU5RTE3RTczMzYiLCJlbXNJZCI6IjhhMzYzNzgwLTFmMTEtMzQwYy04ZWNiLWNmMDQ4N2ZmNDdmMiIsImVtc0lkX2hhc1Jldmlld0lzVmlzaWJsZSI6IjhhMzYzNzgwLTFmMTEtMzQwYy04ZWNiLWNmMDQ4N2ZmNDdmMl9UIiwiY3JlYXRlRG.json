As Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig's private detective character) says at one point in Knives Out, it is \"the exception that proves the rule.\" Rian Johnson's whodunit has more than a few surprises; it's also a wry take on the privilege of class, the dysfunction of family, the contribution of immigrants, and the decline of personal initiative.  Don't misconstrue: Knives Out is a witty, occasionally laugh-out-loud, cleverly plotted mystery that manages to reinvent the detective story while paying homage to some of the greats: Christie, Chandler, Hammett. Johnson shows a great affinity for the genre, from the memorabilia-crowded rooms of the mansion to the piano key-tickling affectation of Blanc, he sets a tone that incorporates in the noir tale a spitfire humor and a believable premise. The sets, the photography, the writing, the acting, the directing: all contribute to an engaging - pun intended - slice of Hollywood mayhem. It would take too long to single out any one cast member for praise: they inhabit their roles that completely. Knives Out is, to put it mildly, some very sharp cinema.","displayName":"Ranier  G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T05:44:51.624Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T15:01:29.745Z","user":{"userId":"978183577","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ranier  G","accountLink":"/user/id/978183577"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"amazing plot twist! loved it!!!!! must see!!!!!!","displayName":"Adam","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T05:43:44.049Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T05:43:44.049Z","user":{"userId":"CA0F8903-4708-48B3-9460-13A0D2D47CDC","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Adam","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"}]}
