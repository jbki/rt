A mystery movie centered around 2-time Oscar winning actor Daniel Craig, that gave heavy Agatha Christie vibes. This is one of the rare movies that lives up to its hype, and will make you want to see the movie repeatedly. \n\nThe cast was well balanced. It wasn't a movie where there is essentially no budget, and they go overboard with the cast and unnecessary features, while not paying much attention to the quality of the plot itself. This was not that. When the plot became stressful the comedic relief of Chris Evans balanced the entire movie.\n\nDaniel Craig excels, and is well supported by the stellar cast. Cinematography is brilliant. Not a dull moment. Tightly directed. One of the best detective motion pictures.\n\nFrom my 13-year old son: I was on a streak of back-to-back 5 star movies (Frozen 2, Jumanji: The Next Level). Knives Out continues the streak, and secures the 2 spot on my Best Movies of The Decade list, only behind Frozen 2. Knives Out gets a 5 star rating","displayName":"Amit B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T00:58:54.423Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T00:58:54.423Z","user":{"userId":"cab49c1d-9300-43ed-bb08-a0ffdb3cba5d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Amit B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Good plot keep you guessing","displayName":"Cora","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T00:58:38.217Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T00:58:38.217Z","user":{"userId":"7d84b30a-268c-46de-899d-f6d186dfdc16","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Cora","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Entertaining, but could have waited to see it on streaming serivce when it is out of the theaters.","displayName":"Average movie goer","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T00:56:16.981Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T00:56:16.981Z","user":{"userId":"07b05272-5f59-482c-8eb9-1d7c482bf55c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Average movie goer","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Its a really well done who done it like murder on the orient express.
