Ana De Armas was excellent, but Daniel Craig was horrible.  I have no idea where his accent was supposed to be going, but it was nowhere close.  The remaining cast was wasted on underdeveloped caricatures.  The mystery was obvious from the beginning and most of the humor missed the mark.  A good who-dunnit makes you want to watch it again to see what you missed.  No need with this one.","displayName":"Steven B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T16:45:37.050Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T16:45:39.923Z","user":{"userId":"978410999","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steven B","accountLink":"/user/id/978410999"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"}]}
