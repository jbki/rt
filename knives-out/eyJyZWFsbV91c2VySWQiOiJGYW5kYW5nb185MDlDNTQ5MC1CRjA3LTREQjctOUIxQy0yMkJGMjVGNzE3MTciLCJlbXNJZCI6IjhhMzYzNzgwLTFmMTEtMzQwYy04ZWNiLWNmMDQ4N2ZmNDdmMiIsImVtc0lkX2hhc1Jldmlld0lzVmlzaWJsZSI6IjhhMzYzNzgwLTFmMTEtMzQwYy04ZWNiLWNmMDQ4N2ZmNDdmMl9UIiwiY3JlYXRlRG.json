Reminiscent of Clue with unexpected twists from beginning to end, this was a movie worth seeing in theaters for the audience live reactions alone. Yes, Chris Evans was looking A+ in that sweater, and every member of the cast was excellent, but I do wish they had taken more time to introduce us to the characters. The interrogation was a great device to flesh out the world, but in the end I did wish we cared more about the GOOP daughter-in-law once removed and Jamie Lee Curtis' character. An all-star cast that was not necessarily utilized to the height of their talent.","displayName":"Akilah H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T02:40:54.351Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T02:41:03.058Z","user":{"userId":"978433339","realm":"RT","displayName":"Akilah H","accountLink":"/user/id/978433339"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Everyone who saw this with me had a different theory and none of us were right!

It takes a fresh approach to the whodunnit genre and gives us one of the year's most entertaining films.  It is filled with a bunch of delicious, scene-stealing actors who are allowed to thrive as priate investigator Daniel Craig tries to find out who killed a wealthy head of a greedy family. Everything from the gothic setting right down to the overcast cinematography works. This makes me so happy to applaud original filmmaking at its best.","displayName":"Steve S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T02:11:09.958Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T02:11:11.329Z","user":{"userId":"900948227","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steve S","accountLink":"/user/id/900948227"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"}]}
