A painfully slow, unfunny movie about a bunch of unlikable characters.  I couldn't give a damn about any of them.  The movie felt like it was 7 hours long.  At one point, Daniel Craig said \"am I boring you\" and I said \"yes\" aloud.  It was the only time I heard laughter in the theater.  I would have left, but my boyfriend wanted to see if it would get better.  It didn't.","displayName":"Anastasia B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-11-30T21:53:33.407Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T21:53:42.292Z","user":{"userId":"978413037","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anastasia B","accountLink":"/user/id/978413037"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Unforeseeable twists, perfectly casted, and a must see for any 'who dunnit it' fanatic!.
