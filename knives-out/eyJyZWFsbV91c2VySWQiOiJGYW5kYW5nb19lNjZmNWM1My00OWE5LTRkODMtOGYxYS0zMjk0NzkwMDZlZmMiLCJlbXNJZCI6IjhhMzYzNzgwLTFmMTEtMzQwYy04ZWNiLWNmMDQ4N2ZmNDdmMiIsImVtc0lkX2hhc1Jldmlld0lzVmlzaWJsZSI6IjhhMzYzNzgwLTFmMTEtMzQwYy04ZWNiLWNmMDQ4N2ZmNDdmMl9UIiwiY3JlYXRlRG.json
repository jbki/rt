A tight plot moves quickly while still delving in deeply to the story and each character's motivations.

The movie is very engaging from the beginning, the mystery kept me focus from start to end. The pace on how the story evolved was just perfect.

Every shot is composed in a way to either tell a clue or move this story in the most entertaining way. It revels in the genre, paying homages to some of the iconic films in that field, but also works in topical and modern themes that add another layer on top of just a simple murder mystery. One of the best films of the year.","displayName":"John M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/144800364/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T13:02:59.575Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T15:37:52.262Z","user":{"userId":"782158336","realm":"RT","displayName":"John M","accountLink":"/user/id/782158336"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"}]}
