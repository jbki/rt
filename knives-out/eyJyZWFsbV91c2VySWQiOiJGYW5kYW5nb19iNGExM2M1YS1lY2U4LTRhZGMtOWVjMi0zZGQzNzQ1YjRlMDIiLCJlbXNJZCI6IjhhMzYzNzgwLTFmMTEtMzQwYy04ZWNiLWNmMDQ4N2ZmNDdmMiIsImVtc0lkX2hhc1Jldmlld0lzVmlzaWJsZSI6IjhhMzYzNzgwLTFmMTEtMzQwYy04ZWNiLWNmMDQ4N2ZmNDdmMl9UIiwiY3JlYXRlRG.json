I think I expected it to be more of a classic who-done-it and was slightly disappointed to discover that the murderer and mode of killing is revealed very early in the movie. The rest of the movie mostly deals with trying to cover things up and keep the truth from the police. My other main complaint was the language. There was quite a bit of unnecessary cursing for a PG-13 film.  The cast and acting were all excellent, and Daniel Craig did a wonderful job as the detective it was easy to lose him in the role. There were definite funny moments, and overall it was a fairly enjoyable film. For me, it just wasnt quite what I expected going into it.","displayName":"Michael M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T18:58:16.134Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T18:58:16.134Z","user":{"userId":"b6e61591-3f82-4654-8e87-62aec8d3d813","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael M","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A great movie.
