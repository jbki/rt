It was funny and with an intriguing detective story searching to find the truth behind a suspicious death ruled a suicide.  The family is awaiting their inheritance and everyone suspects each other of foul play.  \nThe cast was top notch and everyone delivers their part perfect.","displayName":"Brian L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T21:32:10.548Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T21:32:23.365Z","user":{"userId":"901186994","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian L","accountLink":"/user/id/901186994"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Clever and entertaining........","displayName":"JJJ\nJJJ","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T21:28:44.270Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T21:28:44.270Z","user":{"userId":"628ABE41-10DF-411D-AB02-74858B68C01E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"JJJ\nJJJ","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I was not a fan of Rian Johnson's Star Wars The Last Jedi but i did enjoy this film a lot. The Actors and Actresses did a fantastic job in this film, the biggest performance that stood out to me was Dainel Craig and Ana De Armas. Don't get me wrong Chris Evans and the other cast were great but those two stood out the most for me. I can't really tell you a whole lot because it would spoil the film. But i can say confidently that this was a enjoyable who dun it film.","displayName":"Dylan  F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T21:26:48.073Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T21:26:54.713Z","user":{"userId":"977981770","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dylan  F","accountLink":"/user/id/977981770"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Hilarious!
