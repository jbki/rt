It was long and draggy. Main character was about 90 percent of the whole movie. The Movie very quickly in the movie let you know who the killer was so when it was revealed what happened in the end we already knew. It was a little twist at the end but it wasnt worth me and will see you again especially on Thanksgiving","displayName":"Barbara","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T10:15:05.458Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T10:15:05.458Z","user":{"userId":"eb43c7e8-5487-4fad-be26-9b3121767a6f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Barbara","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great movie. best of the year","displayName":"Joey","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T09:56:56.888Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T16:46:15.838Z","user":{"userId":"2C8F97F6-CF55-4079-9641-073F4740DF0D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joey","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Fun movie tip watch!!
