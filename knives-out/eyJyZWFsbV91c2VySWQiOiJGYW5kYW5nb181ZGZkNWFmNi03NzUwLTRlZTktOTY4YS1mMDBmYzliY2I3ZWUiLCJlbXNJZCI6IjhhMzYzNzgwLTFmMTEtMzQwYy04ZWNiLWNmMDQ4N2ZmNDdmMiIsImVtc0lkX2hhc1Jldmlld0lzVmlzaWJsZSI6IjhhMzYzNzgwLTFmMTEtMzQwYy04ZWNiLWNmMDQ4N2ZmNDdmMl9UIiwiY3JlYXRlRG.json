It uses the ancient Agatha Christie formula of murder of the aged patriarch in the rather creepy huge old house with the large dysfunctional family In attendance. Daniel Craigs attempt at a Southern drawl was almost as bad as Dick Van Dykes attempt of a cockney accent in the original Mary Poppins. If anybody receives such a huge dose of morphine intravenously, they would be out in a matter of seconds, and the Christopher Plummer character would have realized he had not received that dose, very quickly. The plot had so many holes and was simply not credible. It was rather disappointing.","displayName":"Jo","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-04T00:35:41.092Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T00:35:41.092Z","user":{"userId":"c6f57f6d-776d-4b33-8a90-d73a35059cfe","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jo","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Lots of colorful actors & acting!","displayName":"Tanya","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T00:34:21.712Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T00:34:21.712Z","user":{"userId":"6f1a88b2-e847-4226-b7da-04da482c6462","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tanya","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Delightfully funny and entertaining throughout the duration of the film. Theres also an underlying message that inspires kindness and consideration towards mankind. A refreshing undertone thats unexpected in a movie advertised as a coming of age murder mystery. Id give it ten stars, if I could and I hope to see it nominated at the highest levels within the academy.","displayName":"RitaBee","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T00:30:30.673Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T00:30:30.673Z","user":{"userId":"ac9d84ed-4f63-4214-a156-2ef6ddbe9c74","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"RitaBee","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A fun whodunnit with a refreshing take on the murder mystery genre.
