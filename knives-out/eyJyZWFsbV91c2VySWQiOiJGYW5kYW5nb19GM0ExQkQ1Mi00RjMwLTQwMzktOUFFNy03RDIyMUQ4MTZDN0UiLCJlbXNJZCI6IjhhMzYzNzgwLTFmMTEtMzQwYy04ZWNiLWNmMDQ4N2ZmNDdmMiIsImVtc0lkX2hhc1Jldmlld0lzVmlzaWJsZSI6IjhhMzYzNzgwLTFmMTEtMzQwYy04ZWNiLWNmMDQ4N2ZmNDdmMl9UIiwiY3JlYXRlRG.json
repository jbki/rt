Knives Out is a good time for the fans of Agatha Christie, Hercule Poirot, Jessica Fletcher, and Clue. The tenets of a murder whodunit with its misdirecting clues are well applied. Our lead character Marta, played by Ana de Arnas, is given an odd characteristic that many people will buzz over. At any rate, as the deceased guy's last nurse/caretaker, she gives a good performance that draws the audience in and makes us care about the outcome for her. This is a really good ensemble cast. If you want to get your Don Johnson (Dakota's dad) fix, here is your movie. Chris Evans shows some range that is quite different than his Captain America persona. Christopher Plummer and Michael Shannon are consummate pros. There is even a rare brief in person performance by Frank Oz. As our private detective, Daniel Craig flawlessly inhabits a southern patois that I found simultaneously grating and completely credible. Even without a great deal to do, Jamie Lee Curtis owns her character and made me wonder why we don't see more performances from her in top tier films. Rian Johnson did a good job, including by giving us a study, only leaving out Colonel Mustard and the candlestick.","displayName":"Greg C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100003331182114/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T03:52:07.554Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T03:52:12.044Z","user":{"userId":"929312942","realm":"RT","displayName":"Greg C","accountLink":"/user/id/929312942"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Boring just a clue remake Ryan Johnson cant direct shit","displayName":"Antonio S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002436278035/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-02T03:50:46.274Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T03:50:57.741Z","user":{"userId":"972667952","realm":"RT","displayName":"Antonio S","accountLink":"/user/id/972667952"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Very entertaining!
