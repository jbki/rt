The humor is good but not as funny as the film thinks it is.  While not the same genre it reminds me of past Rian Johnson efforts like Looper and the Last Jedi that were ultimately more show than substance.  It was enjoyable for sure, but it is not the blockbuster that critics are calling it.","displayName":"William S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T19:33:21.741Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T19:33:24.597Z","user":{"userId":"976870191","realm":"RT","displayName":"William S","accountLink":"/user/id/976870191"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Lot of fun guessing who done it.
