The acting was solid by the overstuffed cast - Ana De Armas had the closest thing to a breakout performance. \n\nCons: at 2hr 10min, the movie felt long and bloated (Johnson just can't figure out a way to tighten up his movies).  The movie is not as humorous or witty as you'd expect, and Johnson can't help but inject a healthy dose of politics into the script in ways that are only tangentially related to the plot. \n\nUltimately, the most fun part of a whodunit is the opportunity to speculate and formulate ideas on who the killer is. Johnson purposely takes this opportunity out of the movie.\n\nVerdict: based on the hype, I was expecting a lot more. Passable and somewhat entertaining, but not at all deserving of the acclaim it's receiving.","displayName":"Chris W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T02:00:53.477Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T02:01:00.384Z","user":{"userId":"784937018","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris W","accountLink":"/user/id/784937018"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A murder mystery told via current events & flashbacks.
