You would never have thought that Rian Johnson would have made that abomination. This is the Rian Johnson who brought us such clever and intelligent movies like Brick and Looper. The film is utterly unpredictable and keeps you guessing until the third act reveal. The script is quite literally one step ahead of you. It's the kind of film that once you have seen the twists you can go back and re-watch how they pieced together. The stellar cast are all great too and the film wastes none of it's 130 minute run time.\n\nExcellent!","displayName":"Glyn D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T10:11:02.414Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T10:11:02.414Z","user":{"userId":"967574917","realm":"RT","displayName":"Glyn D","accountLink":"/user/id/967574917"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great script, great actors, great twist and very, very, funny.","displayName":"Anita S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/727546986/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T09:28:31.018Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T09:28:40.356Z","user":{"userId":"910285442","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anita S","accountLink":"/user/id/910285442"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I liked it.
