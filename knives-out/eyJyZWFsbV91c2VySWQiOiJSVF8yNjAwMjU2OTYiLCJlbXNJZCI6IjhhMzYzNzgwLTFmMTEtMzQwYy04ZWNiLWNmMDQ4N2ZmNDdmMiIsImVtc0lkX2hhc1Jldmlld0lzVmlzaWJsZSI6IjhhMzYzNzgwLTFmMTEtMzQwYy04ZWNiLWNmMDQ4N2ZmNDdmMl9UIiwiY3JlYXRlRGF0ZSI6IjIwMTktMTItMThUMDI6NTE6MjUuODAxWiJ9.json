Not bad but left me wanting more, one more twist would have been great.  The 20 minute reveal was a waste of time because it was pretty obvious by that point.

There were so many twists and turns it was hard to predict where it might go next. And right up until the very end, too. Well worth it. The ONLY thing that was a little off-putting was Daniel Craig's absolutely phony sounding mid-South drawl! (Where was it supposed to be? Tennessee? Kentucky? No idea for sure. But it just wasn't right. Aside from this one thing though, the whole movie was great, and had a wonderful cast.

There is a nice balance of mystery/suspense, humor, and witty banter to keep things moving along. The cast does a marvelous job bringing the crazy family to life.  Everyone has a motive in this whodunit. The filming was smart and sly enough to keep you guessing. It wraps up nicely, but left us with enough to discuss at dinner afterwards.  I definitely recommend this movie!","displayName":"Gregory M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-18T02:41:56.225Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T02:41:56.225Z","user":{"userId":"56a04c23-3f43-4aee-a517-5f6a64afc699","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Gregory M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wicked funny and a real cliff-hanger too!","displayName":"Mary H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-18T02:41:43.329Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T02:41:43.329Z","user":{"userId":"65cee0b2-8b8b-45e1-acf6-cc9e9383d36e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mary H","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"great story that will leaving you guessing left and right. the cast is perfect for thier parts.","displayName":"Percy N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-18T02:41:15.468Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T02:41:15.468Z","user":{"userId":"9610AC0A-F1ED-43AC-A921-5793EAA32C60","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Percy N","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome film.
