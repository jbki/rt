This is such a spoiler-laden film that I think you should go in as blind as possible. While I won’t be spoiling any of the major plot details, even talking about story structure could be seen as too much information. I truly loved Knives Out. It is a movie that surprised me in ways I never expected. It’s also a wonderful movie for almost all of the family (young kids excluded.) There were 3 generations of my family at this movie and we all had a great time. We even talked about it with people afterwards when we arrived at a restaurant, convincing them to give it a try. I have little doubt this will be one of my Top five films of 2019, and one of the rare murder mysteries that I’ll enjoy watching multiple times. There’s enough going on in this movie that I think I could still have fun with it even when I know the truth. That’s all I’ll say for those who have not seen the movie and might see it. Everything beyond this point should be avoided unless you’ve seen Knives Out or think you will never see it. I think the biggest challenge with watching murder mysteries at this point in my life is that I have seen/read so many that my brain starts going to work on discovering the truth immediately. I was instantly noting details in Knives Out, and even though I would rather be surprised, it’s an involuntary response for me to start trying to spoil the ending for myself by “solving” it. In the opening scenes, it seemed like the movie would be an extremely traditional murder mystery that is so straightforward it could be deduced without breaking a sweat. Then, without warning, the truth is shown to us. Like a kid who’s too excited to hold in a secret, Knives Out spills its guts in the first act. Rian Johnson is clearly such a fan of the murder mystery genre that he knows people like me are sitting out there waiting to outsmart his plot, so he takes control out of our hands and leaves us completely confused about what will happen next. It’s a movie that reinvents itself more than once, and that’s such a satisfying feeling, particularly from a genre that can be formulaic. There was even one moment when my wife turned to me in the theater and asked “Is this really the movie we’re watching now?” and I was delighted because we had both been completely disarmed by this clever plot shift. It would be hard to find a better cast than what they have in Knives Out. I’m delighted that Rian Johnson saved this script until he had the clout of a Star Wars film under his belt, so he could have the budget to bring in A-listers like Daniel Craig, Jamie Lee Curtis, Christopher Plummer, and more. Even the lesser-known faces were amazing, including a star turn from Ana de Armas that I hope catapults her to many more lead roles. I also loved that Rian Johnson had several actors play against type, including a hilarious accent from Daniel Craig that had me laughing from the first time he opened his mouth. Which reminds me that Knives Out is also a solid laugh-out-loud comedy. There are physical gags, some witty lines, and good situational jokes as well. One of the most impressive things is that Rian Johnson was able to thread the needle and get political with some of the humor, but without taking a side. Since every member of the family is selfish, shallow, and mean-spirited, both sides of the debate are vilified. There was very little I disliked about Knives Out. It might have dragged out a couple of the reveals a bit much, but I still found it to be an awesome film.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T20:44:23.215Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T20:44:23.215Z","user":{"userId":"855043855","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/855043855"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wonderful movie.
