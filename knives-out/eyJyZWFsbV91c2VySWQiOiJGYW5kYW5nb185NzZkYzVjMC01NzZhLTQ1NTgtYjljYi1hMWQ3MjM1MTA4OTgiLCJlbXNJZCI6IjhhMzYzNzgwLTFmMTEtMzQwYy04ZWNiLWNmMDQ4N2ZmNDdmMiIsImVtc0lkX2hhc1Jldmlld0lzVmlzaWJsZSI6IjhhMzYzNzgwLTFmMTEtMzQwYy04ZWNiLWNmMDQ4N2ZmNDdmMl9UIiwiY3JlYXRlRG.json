The real mystery here is who paid off all the critics to rate this movie five stars? I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after reading all the glowing reviews until I actually saw it and realized what a convoluted and contrived mess it was!  The plot suspends belief ... too silly and stupid to follow with too many characters. And who thought the main character vomiting every time she lies would be cute, it's not, in fact, it's down-right gross!  And, could somebody tell me why Daniel Craig, the main detective, runs around with the most over the top, exaggerated, southern accent you can imagine when the movie takes place in Massachusetts? He sounds like that big leghorn chicken from that old 50's cartoon from Warner Brothers - believe me he's not doing himself any favors with this acting job. Here's a tip, take your money and buy a ticket for the Good Liar instead. The critics only gave that three stars but IMHO was an excellent mystery and thriller. Go figure that!","displayName":"Tara W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T05:08:31.147Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T05:09:15.486Z","user":{"userId":"978407699","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tara W","accountLink":"/user/id/978407699"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"very good. on scale of 1-good movie this is a 14","displayName":"Eve","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T05:05:52.752Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T05:05:52.752Z","user":{"userId":"a60dec3a-ad67-4ca5-97f8-0ff9598f8589","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Eve","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Itâ€™s basically clue but with a few easy to guess twists at the end.
