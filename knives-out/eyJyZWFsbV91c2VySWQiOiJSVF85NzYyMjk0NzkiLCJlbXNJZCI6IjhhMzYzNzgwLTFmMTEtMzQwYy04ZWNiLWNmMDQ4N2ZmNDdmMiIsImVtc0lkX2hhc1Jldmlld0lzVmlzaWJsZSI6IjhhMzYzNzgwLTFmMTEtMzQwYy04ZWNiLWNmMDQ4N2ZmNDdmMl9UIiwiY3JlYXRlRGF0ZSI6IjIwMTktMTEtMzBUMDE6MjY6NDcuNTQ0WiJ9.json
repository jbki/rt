I did not think that the IMDB parents guides accurately represented the language in the movie. It was a bit offensive to me with all the religious swearwords.

The ensemble cast is not used to the fullest it could have been. They also bring up and hit you over the head repeatedly about immigration. I wanted a murder mystery. Not a political speech. There are plot holes all over this movie. And the characters don't seem like real people. Who would agree to talk to the police without lawyer especially when they are insinuating that you could have done it?! I walked out 3/4 of the way through this movie.
