My only real issue was the political theme of immigration being used in the story. That took away from my overall enjoyment of the movie.

There were parts where my ADD brain felt overloaded with details so that's why I'm taking away half a star from a full five-star review, but the poetic ending justifies the parts I missed and didn't process as quickly.\nI was impressed by Toni Collete's performance as a new-age freeloading lifestyle guru. I was taken unawares by her ability to get so into character. I also really appreciated that chick who played Joi in Blade Runner 2049 as the main character. She really gave the viewer their money's worth, because she could be innocent, she could not be innocent, she gave NOTHING away and I knew I was going to be shocked at the whodunnit at the end no matter what the outcome. Where a lot of mysteries fail in ways this film succeeds is the fact that clues are given, every character fits the stereotype of someone who could totally pull off a murder, but no one in this movie breaks out of character even just a little to give the impression that they're the real murderer or gives away any nuances that someone else will be the murderer. Mysteries should remain mysteries, unpredictable to the very end, and then all the clues come together and shock. It's what Agatha Christie did better than anyone, and the screenwriters met her juxtaposition formula with an equally resounding narrative.","displayName":"Justin P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1299990222/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-18T06:38:44.699Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T06:38:55.044Z","user":{"userId":"782878845","realm":"RT","displayName":"Justin P","accountLink":"/user/id/782878845"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie I have seen in a while, the plot was really good, moderate effects, very interesting dialogues.","displayName":"great movie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-18T06:32:13.373Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T06:32:13.373Z","user":{"userId":"419BD161-F7AC-406E-AA59-561143A039EE","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"great movie","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!!
