Great characters!  Terrific that Christopher Plummer is still performing so excellently.  Fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis, although remembering her parents in movies - a little disturbing to now see her as an \"older\" person!  Quite complicated ending. Lots of twists and turns - still thinking about some of them. Trust we will see the young lead again!  Beautiful and talented Ana!
