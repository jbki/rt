We were kept guessing most of the movie.  We needed the ending to explain the murder and tie everything together.  That's a complement for the writers.  We did guess the killer, it was kind of obvious in the way they were introduced.  Just couldn't figure out their motive.  Well done.\n\nDown side:  It would not have hurt the movie one bit to let Daniel Craig drop the horrible southern(?) accent and speak naturally.  It was actually a bit distracting  to have to listen to him struggle to speak so unnaturally.\nThere is also a distracting level of unnecessary profanity.  It sure didn't  enhance the plot.  Characters burst forth in levels of juvenile profanity that left me wondering more about their intelligence as opposed to their possible motives for murder.  Perhaps it was simply an attempted homage to our ever declining culture and society.\n\nOverall, it was a good afternoon spent at the theater.","displayName":"rdorro","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-09T05:18:28.343Z","updateDate":"2019-12-09T05:18:28.343Z","user":{"userId":"99a8dfcb-6be7-4ee0-bd6c-2eb965f412b9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"rdorro","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very fun movie - quirky, interesting, well acted.
