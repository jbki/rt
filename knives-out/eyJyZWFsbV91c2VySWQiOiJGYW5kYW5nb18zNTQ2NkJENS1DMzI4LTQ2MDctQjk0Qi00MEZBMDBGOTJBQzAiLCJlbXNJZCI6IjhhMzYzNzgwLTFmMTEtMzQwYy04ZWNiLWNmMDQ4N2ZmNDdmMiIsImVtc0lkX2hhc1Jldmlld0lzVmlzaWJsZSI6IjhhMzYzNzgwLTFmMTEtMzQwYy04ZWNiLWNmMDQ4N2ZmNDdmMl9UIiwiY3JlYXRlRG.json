The building of Mystery aspect is too good. Punchlines hit at the perfect moment. Everyone in the theatre was laughing their ass off. \n\nThe best thing about this movie is it's characters. Everyone is appropriate in their roles. The ensemble family gathering scenes were the best. Rian Johnson has made such a clever movie and it's social and political commentary!!! Oh My God!!! The movie is almost perfect. A pure delight.\n\nAna De Armas is the real scene stealer here. And give us more of Benoit Blanc!!! Loved Daniel Craig so much ‚ù§","displayName":"Indrasish C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2147097065515866/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-11-30T13:11:38.195Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T13:11:43.193Z","user":{"userId":"976283952","realm":"RT","displayName":"Indrasish C","accountLink":"/user/id/976283952"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Daniel Craig just makes the movie.","displayName":"David M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T13:10:57.272Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T13:10:57.272Z","user":{"userId":"ea4585ce-92c7-4dec-9260-59584d3669a1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"David M","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Pretty thin mystery.","displayName":"Jonathan L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T13:10:13.887Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T13:10:13.887Z","user":{"userId":"ab1edf33-a749-433f-9e43-af69ea5dedaf","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jonathan L","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was an ok movie.
