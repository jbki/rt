There were no big surprises. The acting was certainly solid. The way that everyone was raving about this though, I was expecting something on par with the Godfather and it definitely was not. I probably would have given it another half a star if my expectations had been set properly. Hopefully I'm doing a public service here and you can go and enjoy it more. It kind of drags in a few spots but the end is a good payoff.","displayName":"Chris S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-06T21:58:12.163Z","updateDate":"2019-12-06T21:58:15.350Z","user":{"userId":"915547260","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris S","accountLink":"/user/id/915547260"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great Movie .
