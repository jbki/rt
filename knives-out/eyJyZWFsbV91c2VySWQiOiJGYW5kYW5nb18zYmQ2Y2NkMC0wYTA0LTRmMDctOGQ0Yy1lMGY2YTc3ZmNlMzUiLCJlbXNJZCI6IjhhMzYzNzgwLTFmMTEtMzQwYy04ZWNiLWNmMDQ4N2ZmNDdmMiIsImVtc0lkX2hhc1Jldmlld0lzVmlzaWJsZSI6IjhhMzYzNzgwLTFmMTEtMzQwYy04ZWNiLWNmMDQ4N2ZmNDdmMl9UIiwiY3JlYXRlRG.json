A great balance of humor and tension. Clearly, the actors were enjoying themselves and were a joy to watch as well.  Great characters without any of them being too over the top.  The relationship between the main character and his nurse was particularly wonderful to watch.  The only thing that would have made it better was a bit more mystery about the main character's death, and perhaps some more red herrings/wild goose chase character developments for good measure, but I'm nitpicking.  Go see it!","displayName":"Joshua I","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T05:13:28.153Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T05:13:28.153Z","user":{"userId":"9e4697e6-7f8f-4221-a977-9c958d464e63","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joshua I","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved this movie.
