Like actually bad. The acting and characters were phenomenal and enjoyable, not a big fan of the political babble. Daniel Craig, however, his accent made no sense and sounded awful. His character was seemingly a Sherlock Holmes type, who knows who's guilty right off the bat, but he has no substance and he comes to conclusions based on something that we have to just accept is his conjecture, without any evidence that he figured it out along the way. The crime is basically given to you right away and the plot twist isn't really grand in any way. Not recommended, more cons than pros.","displayName":"Piper","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T03:55:34.455Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T03:55:34.455Z","user":{"userId":"07B8247F-F0F8-4B1E-8565-60331D112BFD","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Piper","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"the suspense wasn't built up as much as I had hoped. an abstract way of depicting the story but I enjoyed it still","displayName":"madmovies","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T03:55:19.385Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T03:55:19.385Z","user":{"userId":"11ECF9A3-CC72-459B-825A-27B63D6EF719","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"madmovies","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Fun mystery that keeps you guessing...","displayName":"Virginia","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T03:47:10.707Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T03:47:10.707Z","user":{"userId":"f22a3f64-d573-4eb8-9d24-b7bbc34c0cc4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Virginia","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"}]}
