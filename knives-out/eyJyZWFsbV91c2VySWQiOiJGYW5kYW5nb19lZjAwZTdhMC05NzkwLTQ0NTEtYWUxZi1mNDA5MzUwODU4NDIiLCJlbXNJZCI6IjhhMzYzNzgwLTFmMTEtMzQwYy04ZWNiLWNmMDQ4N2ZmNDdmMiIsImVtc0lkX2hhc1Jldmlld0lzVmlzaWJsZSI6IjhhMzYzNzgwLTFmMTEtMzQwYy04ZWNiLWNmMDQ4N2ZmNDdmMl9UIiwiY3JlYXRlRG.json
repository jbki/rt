While the highlights of the film were it's black humor and Ana de Armas' breakout performance the film as a whole seemed as though it was missing something. While the ensemble cast did their best to push along the plot, too many characters were under developed and miss utilized. Few characters ever were really suspects and you learn what actually happened in the first 30 minutes of the film. Less of a whodunnit than expected. While I do think Daniel Craig's character could easily spin this movie off into a series of films I think without a solid team of writers to craft a fully realized script it will be just be more of the same hokey nonsense.","displayName":"Devin C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/730796639/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T08:31:38.751Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T08:31:43.219Z","user":{"userId":"913082831","realm":"RT","displayName":"Devin C","accountLink":"/user/id/913082831"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Excellent murder mystery with lots of twists.
