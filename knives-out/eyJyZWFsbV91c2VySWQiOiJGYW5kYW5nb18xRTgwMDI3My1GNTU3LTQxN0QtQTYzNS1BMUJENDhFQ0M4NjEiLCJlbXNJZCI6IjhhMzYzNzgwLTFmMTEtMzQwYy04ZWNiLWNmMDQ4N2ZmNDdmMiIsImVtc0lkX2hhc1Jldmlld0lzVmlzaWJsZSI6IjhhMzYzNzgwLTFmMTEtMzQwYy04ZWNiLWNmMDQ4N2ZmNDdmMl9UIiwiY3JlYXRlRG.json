I tried to predict all the twists and only was able to guess about half. References to classic murder mysteries are all over the film. The entire cast was chewing up scenery and having a hell of a good time. All your expectations will be more than met.

As a big fan of detective stories I was very excited about the trailer and was so happy when the movie did not disappoint. Very strong Agatha Christie vibes.
