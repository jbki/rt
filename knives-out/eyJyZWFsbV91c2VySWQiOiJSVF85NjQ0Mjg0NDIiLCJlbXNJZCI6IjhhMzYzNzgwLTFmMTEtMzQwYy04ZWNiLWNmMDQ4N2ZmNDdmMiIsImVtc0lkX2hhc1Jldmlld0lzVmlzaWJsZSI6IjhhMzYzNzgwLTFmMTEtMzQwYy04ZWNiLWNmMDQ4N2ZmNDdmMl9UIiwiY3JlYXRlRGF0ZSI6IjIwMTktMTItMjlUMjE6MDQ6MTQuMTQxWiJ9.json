A comedy/mystery with lots of twists I call it a \"thinking man's\" story line. A mega star cast with Daniel Craig abandoning his Brit accent. You will love the surprise ending!

The only drawback was that it got a little slow in places, but that usually did not last long.  Certainly no reason not to see the movie.
