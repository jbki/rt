I wanted Rian Johnson to provide us with a good movie to make up to the damage to the Star Wars franchise that he did with Last Jedi. Knives Out is a movie that doesn't require thought or an investment in emotion - just sit back and let it take you out of any worries you might have in your life. Most of the acting is \"over the top,\" although I thought that Ana de Armas is brilliant and does an incredible job of acting. The story doesn't have that many clever plot twists, but it is still fun.","displayName":"Sam M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T03:33:44.827Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T03:33:57.753Z","user":{"userId":"976178896","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sam M","accountLink":"/user/id/976178896"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Good story- vey dull and flat.
