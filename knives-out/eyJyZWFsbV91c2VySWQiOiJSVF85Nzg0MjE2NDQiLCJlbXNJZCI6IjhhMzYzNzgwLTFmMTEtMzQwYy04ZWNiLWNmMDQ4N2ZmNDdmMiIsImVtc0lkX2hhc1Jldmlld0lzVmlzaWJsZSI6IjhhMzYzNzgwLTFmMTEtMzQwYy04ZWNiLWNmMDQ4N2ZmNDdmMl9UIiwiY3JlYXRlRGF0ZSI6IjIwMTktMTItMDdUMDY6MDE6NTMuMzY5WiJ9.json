The script is vibrant panache and punctilious. The narrative is stylishly convoluted. The cast is For Your Eyes Only and The directing is so good it's virtually invisible.\n\nThe main set is a very Rockerfellian Vanderbilty summer housey estate that has a modern Anderson Cooperlike vibe to it -- it looks like it should be stuffy musty moldy smelly like a very old old old bottle of perfume.\n\nThe American baroque style details are grounded finessed\n and emphasized with highly selective weighty clunky and noteworthy Tchotchkes!\nPolished carved statues heads sculptures puppets\nin metal marble rosewood paper mache-\n-inside  in mezzanined library and outside on a pine tree landscape\nQuiessential posed cherub faces whimsically frozen non plussed...\nBooks books and more books\nA moody old museum-esque manor.\nBright dust free and\nClean clean clean\n\nArt deco fabric wall paper spotless\nKooky nice antiques and technology smerge side by side,\nlike a Roman Villa with an infinity pool and gas fireplace.\n\nCostly Emotional knickknacks that only an eccentric collector loves and visitors question and silently snicker at.\n\nThis concise haberdashery establishes the background literally, without which\nthe film would fall flat. \nThis is the main silent character. It is the whole tone ambiance that glues and buttresses the dynamics and the characters.\n\nThe cinematography is flattering\nLike a 1960's under lit Polaroid snapshot with Blurple pink lavender hues and plum tones.\nMinimalist accent lighting of campfire golden lights at night in sconces, tulip chandeliers and daylight streaming in through porthole windows. \nEverybody looks gorgeous.\n\nChoppy shots and editing keeps the pace exciting upbeat and accelerates the action.\n\nThe ensemble is \nQuirky funky perfunctory. True to type performances are quippy tarty snappy pithy and defensive of self and for kin...\nNo, they are not bad people they're\nClan absorbed to assure self interests. And assuredly, Money makes strange bedfellows.\n\nStrangely, you can see at any turn the film could denigrate into a comical spoof, or a farce but the secure range of skills that spans old Hollywood,\nClassic Boomers Millenials- prevent this. It's high powered  skills.\nJamie Lee Curtis, Christopher Plummer, Toni Collet, Don Johnson, Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas keep the situational humour on task and on point.\n\nThe dialogue is slight of hand funny. First they're polite then testy then tarty then empathetic, searching through their secure insecurities and absurdities. It's not fast talking but mood swingy. Pay attention or you'll miss a laugh while your rethinking a laugh.\nA Layered fleshed out Holiday Fruitcake with the kitchen sink!\nIt is Herculean, there are no loose ends.\nMaster Craftsman Rian sneakily reveals everything but nothing. The finale is the piece de resistance.\n\nThere is a take away line:\n\n\"Evidence can tell a false story and everyone can lie\"\n isn't that an updated\n\"Don't always believe what you see and hear!\"\n\nLastly it's an easy breezy but not casual, tykes may lag. No profanity or nudity. \n\nEverybody can go and be entertained by their level of participation. And Avoid bathroom breaks ...too much happens to get a whispered recap. \n\nYes it is fun. It's Super Fun. High Fun, if there's such a thing. Even the cameo like dogs get into the act.\n\n\nOh Finally if people don't like rule Number 1, they can have Rule Number 2.\n\nWhat is Rule Number 2 ???\n\n\"Rule Number 2 is if in doubt see Rule Number 1:\n\n\"My Coffee My House My Rules\" \ntee-hee","displayName":"Kirstanuci K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T05:40:43.730Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T05:41:48.447Z","user":{"userId":"978343579","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kirstanuci K","accountLink":"/user/id/978343579"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Sharp, smart, with cutting humor.
