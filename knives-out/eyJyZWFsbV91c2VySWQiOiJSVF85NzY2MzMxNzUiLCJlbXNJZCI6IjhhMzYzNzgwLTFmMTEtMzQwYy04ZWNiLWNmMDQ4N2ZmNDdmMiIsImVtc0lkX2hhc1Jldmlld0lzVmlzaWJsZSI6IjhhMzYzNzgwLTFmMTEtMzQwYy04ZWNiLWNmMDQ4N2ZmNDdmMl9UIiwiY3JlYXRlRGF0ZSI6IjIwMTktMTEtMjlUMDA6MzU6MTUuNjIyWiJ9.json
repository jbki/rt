Benoit...Poirot, a nod to the good old-fashioned super-sleuth. The plot had so many twists & turns my head was spinning. Unlike other who dunnits this movie has no slow build..you are catapulted into the plot immediately..just loved it!! This is a well written script, well played by every character (maybe with the exception of Ransom..his character could be fleshed out). I would recommend this movie for sheer entertainment value.","displayName":"christine D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T00:27:48.189Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T00:27:48.189Z","user":{"userId":"d5a5fade-8f8c-47d6-85b7-b6ba83ab3ca6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"christine D","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Something for everyone, mysterious fun.","displayName":"Sudanem","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T00:27:27.363Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T00:27:27.363Z","user":{"userId":"a4c3a869-7901-4968-a731-1e3bf035a250","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sudanem","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie, very well done.
