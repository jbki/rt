It felt like a very dumb move but I found myself engrossed in trying to figure out \"who done it.\"   The movie was a little long so make sure you visit the restroom beforehand.  You won't want to leave during the movie in case you miss something.  While I wouldn't want to watch it a second time, I did enjoy it very much.","displayName":"nibor","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T18:41:27.782Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T18:41:27.782Z","user":{"userId":"755a8db0-f07f-4196-a362-40527340b0a5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"nibor","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I just want to say if Martin Scorsese would see this one he would have no two doubts about this motion picture termed as one of the best kinds of cinema ever made.\nHaving said that, Marvel movies are cinema too, not his kind of cinema though!","displayName":"Divya M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T18:37:09.616Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T18:38:09.357Z","user":{"userId":"978243523","realm":"RT","displayName":"Divya M","accountLink":"/user/id/978243523"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"My husband and I really enjoyed Knives Out!!
