This movie stars everybody and everyone does an amazing job. This take to the \"who done it\" genre is unique and quite intriguing. \nAs for issues with the movie, there were a few characters that I felt like were just there as the butt of the joke. Specifically, a 16 year old boy who's glued to his iPhone the whole movie. \nI would recommend this for everyone who likes a good Murder mystery.","displayName":"Jim K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T17:40:23.018Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T17:40:26.456Z","user":{"userId":"978378909","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jim K","accountLink":"/user/id/978378909"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great who-dun-it.
