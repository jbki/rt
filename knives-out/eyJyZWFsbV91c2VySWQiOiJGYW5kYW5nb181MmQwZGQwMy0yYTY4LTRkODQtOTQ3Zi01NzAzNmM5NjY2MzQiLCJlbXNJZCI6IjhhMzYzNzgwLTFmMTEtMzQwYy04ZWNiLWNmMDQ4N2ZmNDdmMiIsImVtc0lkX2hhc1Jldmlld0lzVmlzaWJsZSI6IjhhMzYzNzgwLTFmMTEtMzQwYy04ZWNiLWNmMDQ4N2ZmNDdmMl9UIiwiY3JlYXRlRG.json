I'm really disgusted and tired of REVIEWERS saying how great of a comedy it was. The last couple movies I went to were supposed to be these \"AWESOME COMEDIES\" and they didn't even come close. I don't know if everyone in movieland has lost their minds or what but I can't trust any reviews any longer. My concept of a  really good comedy would be SOMETHING ABOUT MARY ...  \nSorry for my digression but it really aggravates me to look forward to a \"advertised comedy\" and be so disappointed every time. This movie was pretty excellent but I can't put it in the comedy column.","displayName":"2BRnot","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-11T12:55:01.766Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T12:55:01.766Z","user":{"userId":"ed9101df-c75c-40c7-832e-8c7eb5fa9b3d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"2BRnot","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2019"}]}
