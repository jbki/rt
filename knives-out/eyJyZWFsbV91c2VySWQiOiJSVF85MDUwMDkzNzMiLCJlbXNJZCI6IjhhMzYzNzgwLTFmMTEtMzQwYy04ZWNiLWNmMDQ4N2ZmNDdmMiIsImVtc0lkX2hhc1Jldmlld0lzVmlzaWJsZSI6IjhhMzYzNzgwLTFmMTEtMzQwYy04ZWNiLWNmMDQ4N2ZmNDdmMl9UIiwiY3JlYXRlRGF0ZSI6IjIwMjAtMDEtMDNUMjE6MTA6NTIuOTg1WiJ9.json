It is more like a Hercule Poirot detective movie.  Great cast and respectable performances from all, even though it did seem that some were delivering their lines with \"tongue in cheek\", and Daniel Craig appeared to be recovering from a hangover throughout the movie.","displayName":"Lee S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T20:52:01.306Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T20:52:21.268Z","user":{"userId":"929587644","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lee S","accountLink":"/user/id/929587644"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"10h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"We saw it for the second time with friends on New Year's Eve and enjoyed it just as much as tahe first time.

Daniel Craig was wonderful, as was almost everyone else, One of the few movies these days that wasnt biased with the political jokes, instead making fun of both SJWs and the Alt-Right equally. The murder mystery itself couldve been stronger, honestly that was the movies only downfall. When it ends youre left thinking, the story was good, but it couldve been so much better. Yes, you find out what really happened halfway through the movie, but you expect the second half to be just as good yet it ends up being weaker than the first half for sure. Definitely see the movie, but its not necessary to see it in a theater. Ill add that as someone who lives in Boston, Im so glad they filmed this in Massachusetts. Hollywood rarely captures the vibe and people but this movie does. Chris Evans was born and raised in greater Boston and I suspect he helped capture the authenticity.","displayName":"Lorraine","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T20:15:45.366Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T20:15:45.366Z","user":{"userId":"bf7a06f1-2dfb-4729-8f91-a2942f11756d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Lorraine","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"10h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great who-dun-it.
