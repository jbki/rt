It wasnt my first choice of movies to watch. (I got out voted.) Ive never been more happy to be wrong. This flick is fantastic! The story is intriguing, with plenty of well timed dark humor to keep even my ADD addled brained attention. If youre thinking of seeing this film, but on the fence, do yourself a favor, get some snacks and buy the ticket. The flick starts slow but that only makes the build up and climax that much better. Happy movie going!

It really combines multiple genres really well - it's funny, thrilling, scary, and dramatic all at the same time and it balances these genres well. All performances are really well done; but special shout out to Daniel Craig who is amazing as a James Bond-ish detective and Ana De Armas as the nurse. Highly recommend!","displayName":"Justin J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/747315560/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T13:09:21.416Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T13:09:35.714Z","user":{"userId":"859987258","realm":"RT","displayName":"Justin J","accountLink":"/user/id/859987258"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best movie Ive seen in a long time","displayName":"JORGE","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T13:05:32.131Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T13:05:32.131Z","user":{"userId":"416a112b-1046-4c80-b2c0-58b91d375deb","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"JORGE","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"}]}
