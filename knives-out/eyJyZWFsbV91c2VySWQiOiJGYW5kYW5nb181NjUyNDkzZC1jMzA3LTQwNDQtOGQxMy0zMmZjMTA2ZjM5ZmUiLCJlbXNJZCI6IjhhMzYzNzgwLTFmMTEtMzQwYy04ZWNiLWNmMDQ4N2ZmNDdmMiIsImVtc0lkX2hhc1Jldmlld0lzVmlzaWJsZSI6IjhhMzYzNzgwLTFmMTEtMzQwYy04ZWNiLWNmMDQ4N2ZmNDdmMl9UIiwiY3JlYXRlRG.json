That being said, I totally thought I had this movie all figured out considering there was some seemingly big reveals. Oh no, I was very pleasantly surprised and very wrong in the end. I never saw it coming! My husband is a very sharp guy and critical of movies. Even he was very pleasantly surprised and glad he saw it in the end! I think it's definitely a fun and interesting film.
