Rian Johnstone seems to bro g a certain enthusiasm to the film when creating these characters and how he executes certain scenes is sublime to any other picture this year. Furthermore the acting is solid all round with Chris Evans being great as Ransom as well as a shock in a how good De Armes is in the lead role -alongside Daniel Craig- as she brings such a good spirited portrayal of the character which you can't not love. Consequently I believe this is the strongest Daniel Craig has ever been in any role besides James Bond as he gives an almost animated vibe for me with his detective role and surely is one of the best performances of the year and I am sure he will at least get a nod for his role","displayName":"Luke D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T14:43:40.363Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T14:43:42.261Z","user":{"userId":"977707094","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luke D","accountLink":"/user/id/977707094"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Its been a while since I saw a movie like this.","displayName":"Az","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T14:41:32.853Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T14:41:32.853Z","user":{"userId":"c5b8eebe-543e-4ac5-9dad-16acf9be8f81","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Az","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great story, great cast, great acting, nice twists.","displayName":"Karonalady","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T14:31:49.431Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T14:31:49.431Z","user":{"userId":"37b8b466-0398-4650-a480-ebfa94fce827","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Karonalady","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great mystery movie.","displayName":"Bernardo","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T14:29:59.062Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T14:29:59.062Z","user":{"userId":"b419a16e-6fab-4b91-abfe-0049a377dc88","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bernardo","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"}]}
