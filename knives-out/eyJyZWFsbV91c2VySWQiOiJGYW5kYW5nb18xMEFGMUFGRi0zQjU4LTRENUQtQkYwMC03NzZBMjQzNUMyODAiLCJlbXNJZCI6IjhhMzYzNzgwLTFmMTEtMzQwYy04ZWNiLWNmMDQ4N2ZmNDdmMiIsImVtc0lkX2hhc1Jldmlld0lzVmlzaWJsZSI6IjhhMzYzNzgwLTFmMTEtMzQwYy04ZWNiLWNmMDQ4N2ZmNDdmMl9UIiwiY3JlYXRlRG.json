The actors are amazing and build their characters perfectly.  The story has enough curves and head-fakes to keep everybody guessing.  The pacing is outstanding. The balance between mystery and comedy is perfectly handled. I can't discuss the plot as I won't want to give anything away. All I can say is go for the ride and have fun. This one is time well spend.  As a bonus it's also a hell of a date movie!","displayName":"Brian W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-11-30T03:48:33.687Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T03:48:39.690Z","user":{"userId":"975665951","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian W","accountLink":"/user/id/975665951"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Daniel Craig & Chris Evans were great!!
