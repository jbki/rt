Rian proves that not only he's a talented filmmaker but also a phenomenal screenwriter. With a renowned and impressive ensemble cast, Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas are standouts within all of the other outstanding performances, Chris Evans being right behind. With one of the best screenplays of the year, the mystery at its center keeps everyone extremely captivated until the very end, even if you guess \"who did it\" beforehand. Masterfully written dialogue, remarkable editing, and great use of classic cinematography techniques. It's an entertaining story with tremendous replay value and significant political/social layers that only elevate the already complex yet subtle narrative. Don't miss it!\"","displayName":"MSBReviews .","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T15:31:12.171Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T15:31:14.285Z","user":{"userId":"976002553","realm":"RT","displayName":"MSBReviews .","accountLink":"/user/id/976002553"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I wasn't expecting much going in, but I was pleasantly surprised.
