The costumes, the sets, the score and the attention to detail are all stellar as well. It's both an endearingly traditional and a refreshingly modern take on the detective mystery genre with plenty of style and fun to offer.","displayName":"David L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000787676881/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T17:25:53.545Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T17:25:55.758Z","user":{"userId":"901488735","realm":"RT","displayName":"David L","accountLink":"/user/id/901488735"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"We found this movie highly entertaining. It was full of plot twists, quirky characters, many laughs, and Daniel Craig. His southern accent was excellent. One plot cliche I was expecting never showed up I'm glad the director was better than that. This was a fun movie we'll no doubt see again when it comes to TV.","displayName":"Kirby M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T17:17:01.897Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T17:17:01.897Z","user":{"userId":"387e2faa-d2d5-412c-a4bc-a80fb2134a09","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kirby M","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Extremely witty, unexpectedly funny!","displayName":"John P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T17:14:34.806Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T17:14:34.806Z","user":{"userId":"beccdcd6-524b-4fab-b005-16e042b3c550","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"John P","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"this movie was such fun we enjoyed every minuet of it.","displayName":"Marlene R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T16:59:19.875Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T16:59:19.875Z","user":{"userId":"b50df076-b502-4236-be0f-b8b62713d726","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Marlene R","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a really good old-fashioned story.
