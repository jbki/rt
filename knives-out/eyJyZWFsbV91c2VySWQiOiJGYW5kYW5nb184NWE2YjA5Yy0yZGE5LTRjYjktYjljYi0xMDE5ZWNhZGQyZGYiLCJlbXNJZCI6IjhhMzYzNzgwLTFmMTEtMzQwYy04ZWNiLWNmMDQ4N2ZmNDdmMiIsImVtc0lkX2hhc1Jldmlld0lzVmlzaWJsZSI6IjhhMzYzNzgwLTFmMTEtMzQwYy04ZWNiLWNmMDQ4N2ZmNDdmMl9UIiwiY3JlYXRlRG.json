Nevertheless, Rian Johnson makes it straightforward and easy to follow, as all good murder mysteries should. The story somehow manages to escape the tired old formula while meticulously maintaining its trappings, keeping the dialogue snappy and the sordid family affairs more fun than sordid. There is a fair amount of partisan politics in this movie, but it's pretty evenly split and is relegated to character quirks, refusing to make a definite statement. It's old and new, clever and simple; it's Rian Johnson at his best.\n\nClosest comparison: It's like an Agatha Christie story for a new generation.\n\nSetting: Murder Mystery\nPlot: Murder Mystery\nTone: Mystery Comedy","displayName":"Boneyard L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T00:07:06.713Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T00:07:06.713Z","user":{"userId":"977547201","realm":"RT","displayName":"Boneyard L","accountLink":"/user/id/977547201"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"kind of long but nice twist at the end","displayName":"sexgod","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T23:58:59.840Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T23:58:59.840Z","user":{"userId":"EF1E34F3-8F87-459D-B474-E160CFECC742","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"sexgod","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I saw Knives Out today at the Century Clackamas 20.
