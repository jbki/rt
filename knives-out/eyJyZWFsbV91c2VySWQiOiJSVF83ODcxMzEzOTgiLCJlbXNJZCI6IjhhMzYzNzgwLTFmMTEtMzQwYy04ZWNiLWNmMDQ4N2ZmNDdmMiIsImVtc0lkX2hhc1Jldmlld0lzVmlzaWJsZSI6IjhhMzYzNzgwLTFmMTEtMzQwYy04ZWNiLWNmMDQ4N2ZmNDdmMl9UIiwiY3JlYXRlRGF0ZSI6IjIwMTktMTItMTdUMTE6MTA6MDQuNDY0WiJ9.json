Rian Johnson  is clearly trying to take the whole whodunnit scenario in a unique direction. Aside from that, Rian Johnson's direction is fantastic as always and the acting is terrific aside from the protagonist who seemed to be overacting a bit. Cinematography was also very good.","displayName":"Brandon C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-17T07:18:46.812Z","updateDate":"2019-12-17T07:18:46.812Z","user":{"userId":"978435070","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brandon C","accountLink":"/user/id/978435070"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie - keeps you guessing and loved the surprise ending!","displayName":"Karen","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-17T06:48:50.448Z","updateDate":"2019-12-17T06:48:50.448Z","user":{"userId":"77a6c257-0700-48d3-9410-a92e94b86936","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Karen","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Clever, entertaining story, great ensemble cast","displayName":"Jean Pierre L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-17T06:48:13.001Z","updateDate":"2019-12-17T06:48:13.001Z","user":{"userId":"e7a6a95e-0ed5-4cdc-8bde-103c33327fb1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jean Pierre L","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Knives out shines in every way.
