I wish a little less was revealed immediately, although the plot dictated it. I figured out who was trying to murder Christopher Plumber very early on and the method, but I like how the details I didnt understand were laid out in the end, like a good Agatha Christie novel. Daniel Craigs character was fun, but the role was written with a flat character. Some more jarring shots with extreme closeups would have been fun and some longer pauses for effect could have been useful. Overall, the movie delivered.","displayName":"Greg C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T14:36:05.641Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T14:36:05.641Z","user":{"userId":"b207e716-6582-4b2d-9f28-33c8028d7de6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Greg C","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"}]}
