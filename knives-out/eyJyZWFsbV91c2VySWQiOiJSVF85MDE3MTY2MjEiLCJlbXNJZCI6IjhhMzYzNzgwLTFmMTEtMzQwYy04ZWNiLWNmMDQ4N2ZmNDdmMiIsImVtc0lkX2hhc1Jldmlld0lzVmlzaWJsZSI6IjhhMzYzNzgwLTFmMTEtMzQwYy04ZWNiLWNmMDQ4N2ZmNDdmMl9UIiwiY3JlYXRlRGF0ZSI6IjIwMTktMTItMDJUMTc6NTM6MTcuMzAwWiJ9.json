Great spooky house setting. Frankly, we went mainly to see Daniel Craig, who was a big disappointment. The problem was his atrocious, exaggerated, mockish ah-shucks Kentucky drawl. He cannot do a southern accent, and I cringed every time he spoke. Delivery sounded like he was redoing lines per voice coach's repeated corrections. His heavy, short herringbone overcoat also made him look even shorter than he is. I think at some point the bad guy said something like he was \"tired of the Craig character's Foghorn Leghorn downhome talk.\" So was I.
