From the first moments you here a sad Dainel Craig try to force an stereotypical southern drawl, to a bizarre Jamie Lee Curits looking like a bee flew up her nose, to Ana Armas's best acting skills being her eyes darting side to side in every scene, as if her acting coach told her that would make her look exotic... I just don't get the appeal. An hour in and I was wishing it would be over and they'd just get on with it. The plot was tired, the laughs forced, the big \"secret reveal\" at the end was far fetched, as if the screen writer just gave up and said \"well.... let's go with this....\" I truly only enjoyed the final 3 minutes, when the juxtaposition played itself out. If you want something to watch on tv in a few months, I'd say skip the theater and wait for it to come our on Netflix or where ever...","displayName":"Erica","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T00:45:18.540Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T00:45:19.406Z","user":{"userId":"9a9a862c-6eba-4e4c-ab96-aaf4b281ab97","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Erica","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"}]}
