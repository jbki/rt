It was too long and had way too many red herrings.  I figured out \"whodunnit\" long before the end of the movie, so the ending help no surprises for me; however, the long and winding road to the ending did have some enjoyable moments.  Daniel Craig was outstanding as were the other cast members.  What I thoroughly enjoyed was seeing many communities from my former home state on the big screen.","displayName":"Ronnee T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10220149114626960/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-17T01:22:47.645Z","updateDate":"2019-12-17T01:23:11.152Z","user":{"userId":"978434712","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ronnee T","accountLink":"/user/id/978434712"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great character development and great plot.","displayName":"Dee","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-17T01:17:19.041Z","updateDate":"2019-12-17T01:17:19.041Z","user":{"userId":"36241369-c2b5-42ca-aaa1-ab11614cc10a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dee","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Very good mystery fun AChristie type film with loads of big name stars.
