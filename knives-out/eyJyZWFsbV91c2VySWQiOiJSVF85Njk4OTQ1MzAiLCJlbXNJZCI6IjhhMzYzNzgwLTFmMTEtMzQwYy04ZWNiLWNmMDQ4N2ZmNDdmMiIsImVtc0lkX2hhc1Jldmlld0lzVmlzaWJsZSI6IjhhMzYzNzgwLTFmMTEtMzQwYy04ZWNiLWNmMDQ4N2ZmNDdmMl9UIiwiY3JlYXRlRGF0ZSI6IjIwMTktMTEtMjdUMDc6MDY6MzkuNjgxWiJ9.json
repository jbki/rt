A powerhouse ensemble cast delivers witty and eccentric characters that you can't help but to root against, arguing back and forth in your mind that anyone of them could be the culprit. Wildly entertaining and engaging, it doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure out Knives Out is one of the best mystery movies you've seen in a long time.","displayName":"Chris B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T06:57:17.583Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T06:57:20.108Z","user":{"userId":"798260093","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris B","accountLink":"/user/id/798260093"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"You will be gravely disappointed if you expect this movie to be something spectacular because it is not. I want to know who is in charge of giving rotten tomatoes these scores. 96% is absurd. 65% fairs better. This is not a movie you will take home. Not a masterpiece by any means which is what the score assumes it to be at first glance. Leaves you with answers that is simply satisfying entertainment. Nothing special.
