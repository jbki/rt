The humor beats are in a similar vein to The Brothers Bloom and while some plot points are predictable, which is to be expected in a story that doesn't hide info from the viewer, the overall experience is very enjoyable. Highly recommended for fans of whodunnit mysteries.","displayName":"Corey K.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T03:13:01.770Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T03:13:01.770Z","user":{"userId":"199E351A-483D-4B02-A02E-D9FFA43266D3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Corey K.","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great entertainment!","displayName":"matt","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T03:12:14.937Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T03:12:14.937Z","user":{"userId":"94E06C58-AD51-4F34-8D50-AF820B302456","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"matt","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best Murder mysteries I have seen in a long time.","displayName":"David S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T03:10:01.085Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T03:10:01.085Z","user":{"userId":"146A139B-DDCB-4171-ADF1-D3C63C0E2664","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"David S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"wow. great movie. thoroughly enjoyable. very clever. well written great acting\nvery smart fun ride from first frame to the very end. outstanding film.","displayName":"Tom W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T03:05:26.871Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T03:05:26.871Z","user":{"userId":"F86BEE0C-727E-4E78-8264-FB43E877351D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tom W","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Loved it!
