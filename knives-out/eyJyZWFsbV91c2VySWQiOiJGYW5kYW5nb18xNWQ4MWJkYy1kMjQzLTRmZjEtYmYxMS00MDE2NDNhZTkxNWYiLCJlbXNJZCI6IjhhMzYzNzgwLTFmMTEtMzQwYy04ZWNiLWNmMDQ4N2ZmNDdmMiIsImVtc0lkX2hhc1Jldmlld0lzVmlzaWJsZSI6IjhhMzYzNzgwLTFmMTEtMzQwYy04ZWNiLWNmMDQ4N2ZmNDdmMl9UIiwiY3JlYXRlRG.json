Fun, fresh, unique, tremendous murder mystery and so classy! The cast shows they are having a great time and excellent fun for me being able to see it. It did make me think back to the \"Columbo\" days in the 70's as well as the Agatha Christie murder mysteries. Daniel Craig showed his great talent as an actor beyond playing James Bond, and Jamie Lee Curtis was outstanding. It's another one of those \"run, don't walk\" to the theater to see it!","displayName":"Mike T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10206687756134572/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T04:14:13.683Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T04:14:19.725Z","user":{"userId":"975003307","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike T","accountLink":"/user/id/975003307"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"A little slow at the beginning for story set up, but great after that.","displayName":"TheRedFox","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T04:13:30.804Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T04:13:30.804Z","user":{"userId":"bd3c7ac1-83ce-4703-b25e-7361dfa6d425","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"TheRedFox","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Loved the ending!
