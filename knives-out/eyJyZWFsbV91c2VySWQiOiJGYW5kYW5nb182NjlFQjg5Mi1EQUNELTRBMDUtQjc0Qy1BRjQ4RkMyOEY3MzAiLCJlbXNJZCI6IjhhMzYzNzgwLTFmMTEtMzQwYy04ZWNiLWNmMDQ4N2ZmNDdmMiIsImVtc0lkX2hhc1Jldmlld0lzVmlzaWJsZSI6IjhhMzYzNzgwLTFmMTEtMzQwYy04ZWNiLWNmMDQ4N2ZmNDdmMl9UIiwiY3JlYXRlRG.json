I loved the modernized version of this classic story concept. It seemed rather simply done with neat twists and turns. It reminded me of the book Sycamore Row, a book I read long ago. Obviously, written in a different time period and such. I think the creators of this film did very well all around. The acting was excellent! Most of the cast that I have seen in other films before definitely were born for their roles here in this film. I apologize in advance, names I am bad at. The actor who played Walt was the perfect choice in my opinion. I feel I see him regularly as a villainous character in most productions. I have to say, as much as I love Chris Evans as Captain America I enjoyed seeing him in another role similar to his comedy relief characteristics from preceding roles. I could go on and on about really the whole cast. They were all wonderfully chosen and did an amazing job. I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't yet seen Knives Out. I hope to see it again as this is a film I would certainly sit through and enjoy again.","displayName":"Mr. John T.

The film is full of fun and compelling characters, all built up by the excellent performances of their actors.
