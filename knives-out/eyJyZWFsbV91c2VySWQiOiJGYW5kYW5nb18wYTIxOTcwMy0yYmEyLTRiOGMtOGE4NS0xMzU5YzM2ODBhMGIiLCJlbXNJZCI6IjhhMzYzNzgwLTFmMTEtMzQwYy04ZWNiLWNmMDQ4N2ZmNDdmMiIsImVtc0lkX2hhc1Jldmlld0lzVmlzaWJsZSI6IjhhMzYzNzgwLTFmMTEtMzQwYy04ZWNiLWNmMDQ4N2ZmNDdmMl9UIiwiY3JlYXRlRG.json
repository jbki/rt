Overall I liked the movie but there were some things that seemed odd.  1 the movie was a bit slow in developing the story line and 2 not sure who thought a British actor playing a detective with a French name, speaking with a southern accent was a great idea, because it wasn't.  Daniel Craig's character was clearly the most annoying character in the story, and I don't think that was by design I just don't think DC pulled it off, as I think the detective character could have been one of the more colorful characters (Chris Evans played his character very well).\nOther than those gripes, a very entertaining movie and would be worth purchasing","displayName":"KevinD66","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T17:03:24.665Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T17:03:24.665Z","user":{"userId":"c4acfc52-073e-404b-b69b-5457a9d286a9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"KevinD66","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Seeing starts from our youth still acting as wonderfully as ever!","displayName":"Margaret Hayes S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T17:02:22.383Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T17:02:22.383Z","user":{"userId":"d02b9f95-b5aa-4d7e-9d81-1ea1e4f975c4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Margaret Hayes S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was stunning, fantastic, and amazing!!

A whodunit somewhat in the vein of Agatha Christie - the movie kept a good pace and kept us guessing.  Unfortunately the ending wrapped up the guesswork quickly and the movie  fizzled a bit at the end.  With such great actors in the cast it was a shame that the central character toward the end was an unknown - the nurse.","displayName":"Harry","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T16:53:17.029Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T16:53:17.029Z","user":{"userId":"35ce88c2-5dc7-43f9-b102-5b7e4b8ef63c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Harry","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"}]}
