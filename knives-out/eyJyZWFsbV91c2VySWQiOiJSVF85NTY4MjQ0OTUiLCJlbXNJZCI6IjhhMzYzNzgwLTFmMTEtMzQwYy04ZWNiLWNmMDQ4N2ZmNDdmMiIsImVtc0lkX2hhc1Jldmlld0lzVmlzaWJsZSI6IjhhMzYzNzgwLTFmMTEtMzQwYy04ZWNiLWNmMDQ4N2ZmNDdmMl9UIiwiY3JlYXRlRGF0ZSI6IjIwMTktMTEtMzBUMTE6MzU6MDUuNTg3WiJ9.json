The all-star cast delivered a very entertaining film that gave us a great homage to one of my favorite literary authors Agatha Christie, yet managed to deliver an original and exciting entry to the genra. Would not have expected less from Rian Johnson, a writer director who does not know how to make a bad movie. I am so ready for more Benoit Blanc stories and I hope Rian Johnson and Daniel Craig keep them coming.","displayName":"Abdullah Y","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/712596656/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T11:20:11.053Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T11:20:14.870Z","user":{"userId":"807043860","realm":"RT","displayName":"Abdullah Y","accountLink":"/user/id/807043860"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Loved the movie.

The acting was exceptional especially from Ana de Armas, Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Michael Shannon, Katherine Langford, Christopher Plummer, K Callan, Noah Segan, Don Johnson, Lakeith Stanfield, and Jaeden Martell. The writing was phenomenal, it was funny, dark, and had a terrific twist. The music was outstanding. The costumes were spectacular especially the ones that Jamie Lee Curtis, Daniel Craig, Toni Collette, Chris Evans, Christopher Plummer, Don Johnson, Michael Shannon, Lakeith Stanfield, and Katherine Langford. The makeup and hairstyling was stupendous especially on Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Ana de Armas, Katherine Langford, Don Johnson, Chris Evans, Michael Shannon, and Daniel Craig. This movie outshined my expectations and is a for sure A+ movie.","displayName":"Noah M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T10:19:59.994Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T10:19:59.994Z","user":{"userId":"976779657","realm":"RT","displayName":"Noah M","accountLink":"/user/id/976779657"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"}]}
