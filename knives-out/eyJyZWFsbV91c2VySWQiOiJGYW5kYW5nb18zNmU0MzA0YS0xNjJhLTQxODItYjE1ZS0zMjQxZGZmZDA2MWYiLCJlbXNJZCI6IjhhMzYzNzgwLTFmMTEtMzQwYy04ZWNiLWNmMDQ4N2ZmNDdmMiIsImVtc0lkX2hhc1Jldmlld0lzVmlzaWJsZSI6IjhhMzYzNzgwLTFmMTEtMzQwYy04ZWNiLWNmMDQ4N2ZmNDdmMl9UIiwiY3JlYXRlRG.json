While not without its flaws it offers plenty of twists and turns that keep you engaged throughout the entirety of the film. A star cast preforms as expected and are unique enough to deliver satisfying individual motives. However despite its long run time almost none of these characters get enough screen time to be fully fleshed out. That said it is a wonderful film that is a must see whether it be at home or in the theater.","displayName":"Daniel V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1695003050/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T06:22:51.491Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T06:22:56.720Z","user":{"userId":"900585103","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel V","accountLink":"/user/id/900585103"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
