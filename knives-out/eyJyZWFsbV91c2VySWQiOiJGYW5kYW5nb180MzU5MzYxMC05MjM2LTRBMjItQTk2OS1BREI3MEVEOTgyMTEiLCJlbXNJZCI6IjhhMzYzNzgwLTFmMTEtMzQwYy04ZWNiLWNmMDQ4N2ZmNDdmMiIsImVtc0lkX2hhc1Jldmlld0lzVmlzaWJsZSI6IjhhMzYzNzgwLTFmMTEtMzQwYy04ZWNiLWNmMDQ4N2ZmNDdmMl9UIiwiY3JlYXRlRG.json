My major complaint was the amount of profanity for a PG-13 movie. I never anticipated the f-word in this movie and honestly I was shocked. I should not have to research the level of profanity present in a PG-13 movie especially when I invite friends to join me. It was disappointing in the extreme, particularly since the language did not add to the story at all.","displayName":"Dianna","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-09T02:30:24.614Z","updateDate":"2019-12-09T02:30:24.614Z","user":{"userId":"45da8a1d-485e-4eb4-b9d2-942d34e90ffa","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dianna","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie keeps you guessing about who killed the grandfather.
