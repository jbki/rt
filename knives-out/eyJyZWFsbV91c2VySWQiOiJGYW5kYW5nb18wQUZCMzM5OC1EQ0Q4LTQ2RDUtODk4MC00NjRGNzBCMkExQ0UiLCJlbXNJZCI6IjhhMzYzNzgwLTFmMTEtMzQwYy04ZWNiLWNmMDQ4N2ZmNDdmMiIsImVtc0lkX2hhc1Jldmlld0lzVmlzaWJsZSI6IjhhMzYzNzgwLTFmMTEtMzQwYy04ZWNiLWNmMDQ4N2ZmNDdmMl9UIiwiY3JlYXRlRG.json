Great acting but grinds slowly presenting the family members until the last half hour.

I did like the plot twist, but I thought it was boring. Besides that, it is a really good movie and definitely passed the time. Chris Evans did a great job and also Ana De Armas. I did not like Daniel Craig's accent, it just sounded weird to me. Altogether, this movie was good and it passed time. Everyone did a great job on this, except Daniel Craig's accent.","displayName":"Joshua  H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T22:18:33.980Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T22:18:37.469Z","user":{"userId":"978366963","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joshua  H","accountLink":"/user/id/978366963"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"very very good mystery thriller with some humor.\n4 stars","displayName":"SITHLORD85","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T22:07:51.629Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T22:07:51.629Z","user":{"userId":"1B3BB80A-4CEA-4B21-AE3C-11DA489A114F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"SITHLORD85","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Watch It!!
