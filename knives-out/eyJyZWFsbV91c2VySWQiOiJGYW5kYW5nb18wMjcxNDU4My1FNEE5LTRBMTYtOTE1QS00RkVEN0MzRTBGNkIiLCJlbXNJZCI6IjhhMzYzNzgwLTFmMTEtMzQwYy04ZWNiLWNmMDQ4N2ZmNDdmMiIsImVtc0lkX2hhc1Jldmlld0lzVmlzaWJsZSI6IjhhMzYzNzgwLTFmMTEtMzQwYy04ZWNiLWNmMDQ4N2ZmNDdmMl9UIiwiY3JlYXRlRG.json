Keeps you guessing from start to finish with plenty of laughs along the way. Wonderful cast that plays well together, the scenery is beautiful and it's got a timeless feel to it.

The movie got funnier and funnier as the film creshendoed into a hilarious finish with the audience in uncontrollable laughter!  This movie is of the Murder by Death and Crooked House genre but Rian Johnson has taken it above and beyond!  The cast is excellent, the writing supberb and there is enough experience and exhuberance that the actors all hit their marks with great timing! Go, enjoy, be entertained and watch a cast that has chemistry and enjoyed working together,  you can see it in their performances!  I think Rian is the new \"Billy Wilder.\"","displayName":"Richard H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T21:22:56.461Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T21:22:56.461Z","user":{"userId":"95c6b1d2-6bf9-4fb5-a6e0-31af410cc101","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Richard H","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Very well written, produced, presented.
