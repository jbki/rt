It's well-written and the cast is all top notch. Daniel Craig has an interesting Kentucky accent, though. It's a cross between Kevin Spacey in House of Cards, and the late Southern gentleman, Shelby Foote, in Ken Burns' great Civil War series.\n\nThere are plenty of twists and turns to make a fair comparison with a good Agatha Christie plot. Rian Johnson does a fine job in spinning a web that maintains your interest throughout the two hours and eleven minutes.\n\nIn many ways this is just like a good old-fashioned classic murder mystery that has been absent from film for so long. The focus is on story and characters, without obligatory sex scenes, toilet humor, and a plethora of four-letter words.","displayName":"Stoo","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-02T19:39:27.395Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T19:39:27.395Z","user":{"userId":"8ab9f8db-18a5-4dc5-aba8-91a70590a2dc","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Stoo","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Rian Johnson's \"Knives Out\" offers an impressive ensemble cast led by Daniel Craig in this cleverly fun whodunit that balances between humor, drama, and some political commentary on wealth and social inequality.","displayName":"Ryan C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T19:38:51.159Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T19:38:56.638Z","user":{"userId":"808875608","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan C","accountLink":"/user/id/808875608"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Classic whodunnit, great cast and nice twists.","displayName":"jesse","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T19:36:02.717Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T19:36:02.717Z","user":{"userId":"1a747e65-5282-413c-9f7f-ad7a5d2ad0d5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"jesse","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"You cannot look away.

The cast was obviously amazing. They all did really good. I was really surprised with the story. The story surprised me at every turn. I never expected who the actual killer was, and how the story was actually going to end. Daniel Craig was fantastic, and easily the standout. I can't wait to see what else he can do. The only problems I had, were that it was less of a who-dun-it and more of a drama, and that a lot of the million dollar cast were side-lined. They didn't get the chance to shine that they deserved.","displayName":"Mack P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T19:20:41.889Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T19:20:45.171Z","user":{"userId":"978409948","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mack P","accountLink":"/user/id/978409948"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good whodunnit and cast.
