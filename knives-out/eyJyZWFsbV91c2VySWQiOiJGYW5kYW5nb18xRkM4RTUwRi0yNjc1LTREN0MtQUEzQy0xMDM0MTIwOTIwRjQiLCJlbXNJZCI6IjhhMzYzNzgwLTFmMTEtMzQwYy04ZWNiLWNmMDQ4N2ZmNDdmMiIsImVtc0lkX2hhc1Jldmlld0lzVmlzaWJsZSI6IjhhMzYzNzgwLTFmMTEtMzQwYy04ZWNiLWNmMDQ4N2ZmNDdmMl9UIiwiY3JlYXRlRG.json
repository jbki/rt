Everything is immaculately conceived, there's sheer pleasure watching something with a completely watertight script and Rain Johnson leaves no stone unturned, his direction is also sleek and zippy bringing life to each frame. The script constantly pulls the rug from under you to the point of carpet burn which felt incredibly satisfying. The whole cast are on top form and clearly love the project especially Ana De Armas who proves that if you're a nice person you'll get what's coming to you. One of the best of the year.","displayName":"Oscar A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-11T21:40:30.835Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T21:40:33.385Z","user":{"userId":"977939403","realm":"RT","displayName":"Oscar A","accountLink":"/user/id/977939403"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2019"}]}
