Really like the old-school style of detective movies. You have to pay attention or youll miss the small subtle clues. It took me back to the Inspector Clouseau movies. Funny, and the cast did a great job!\n\nIt is a slow build up, but I really like a movie that build its suspense and the characters. These type of movies take you on a rideâ€”smooth and building in the beginning, climb up into a climax, and great ending. I didnt want the movie to end.","displayName":"R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T01:38:27.881Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T01:38:27.881Z","user":{"userId":"31a84a4e-cbf6-4e0e-8e63-dc59323ca5dc","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"R","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"}]}
