It is a two and a half hour roller coaster, that not only deconstruct the genre, but also pays glorious homage to it. The acting is incredible, all of the characters are fleshed out and real, everything gets paid but not always in the way you expect it to. This movie has layers on top of layers on top of layers. I don't want this to be a spoiler review, so I will simply say that this movie deserves to be watched in the theater.

I mean, what kind of explanation can I give without giving anything away? Well, the acting ensemble play off their characters as if they were both caricatures and real people, which is a testament to their talent and the director's.
