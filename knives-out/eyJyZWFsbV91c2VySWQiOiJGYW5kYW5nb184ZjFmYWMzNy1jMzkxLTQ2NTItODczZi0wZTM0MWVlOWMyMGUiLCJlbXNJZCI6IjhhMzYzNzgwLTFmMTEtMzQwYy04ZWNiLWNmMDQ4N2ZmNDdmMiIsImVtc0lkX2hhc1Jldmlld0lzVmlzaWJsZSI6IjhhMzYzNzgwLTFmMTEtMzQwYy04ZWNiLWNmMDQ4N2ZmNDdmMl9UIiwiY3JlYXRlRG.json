Maybe the hype heightened the disappointment, but the final reveal of \"Knives Out\" simply can't measure up to the plethora of great whodunnits that have preceded and influenced it. With the suspense lowered, one is able to notice the forced humour, familiar themes, plot holes and mediocre Daniel Craig. \"Knives Out\" is pleasant and has its moments but the lasting impression is of a movie trying really hard.","displayName":"Petros T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T11:06:09.716Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T11:07:11.029Z","user":{"userId":"904514452","realm":"RT","displayName":"Petros T","accountLink":"/user/id/904514452"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Rian Johnson nails this movie perfectly.
