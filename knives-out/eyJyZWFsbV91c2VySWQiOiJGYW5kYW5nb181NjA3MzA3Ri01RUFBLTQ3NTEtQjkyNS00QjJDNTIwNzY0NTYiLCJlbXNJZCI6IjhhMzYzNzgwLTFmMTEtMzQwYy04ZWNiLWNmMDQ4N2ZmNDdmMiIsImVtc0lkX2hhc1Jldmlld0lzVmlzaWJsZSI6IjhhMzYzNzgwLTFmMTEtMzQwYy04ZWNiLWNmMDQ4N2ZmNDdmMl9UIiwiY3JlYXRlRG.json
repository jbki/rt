We thoroughly enjoyed each twist and turn during this movie, and were at the edge of our reclined seats the entire time. Very cool. The Iceeâ€™s were great but very expensive. Also the candy made my tongue sore and every time I would drink the icee after that it would burn. But the movie was great!","displayName":"Reece","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T07:35:06.288Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T07:35:06.288Z","user":{"userId":"2C12251C-F2F3-4FB5-8772-C6C6975668FC","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Reece","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Storyline was really good.
