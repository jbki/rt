You've got to admire the balls on Johnson for veering his story into a completely new direction, especially since this first chunk of 'Knives Out' already works really well as a charming, spicily humorous murder mystery throwback with a super game cast.\n\nUnfortunately for 'Knives Out,' the film's genre-subverting second act drags after an electric introduction to its central mystery. The plot doesn't go anywhere in particular, depending on the suspense of a certain reveal to carry the rest of the film onward, just to no great avail. Again, what Johnson does is super respectable, but the result isn't quite engaging or thrilling enough to back the twist up. Additionally, the film's very final reveal feels a little convoluted and reliant on too small, unclever details while trying to put a bow around everything.\n\nBut overall, Johnson ends up telling an excellently constructed narrative about the relationship between immigrants and, ahem, entitled homegrown Americans. Though the genre elements of the film deliver as a double-edged sword, the real story at the heart of 'Knives Out' is cuttingly telling and very smartly written.","displayName":"Hector V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-03T05:00:40.476Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T05:00:40.476Z","user":{"userId":"977436384","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hector V","accountLink":"/user/id/977436384"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great whodunnit! loved every minute of it","displayName":"jennifer w","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T05:00:39.843Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T05:00:39.843Z","user":{"userId":"9cd381d7-c56a-46ff-aeca-66828c515b00","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"jennifer w","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Fun, especially Daniel Craig.

Excellently cast. Excellent plot. Deliciously funny. Love the plot twists, dry humour, and a verbose script. Kept my attention for the entire span and not once was I disappointed.  For someone that usually solves the case long before the main puzzle piece is identified, this one kept me guessing. I eventually figured out the who but couldnt figure out the how. Loved every moment. This one will be on my repeat watch list, alongside my other favourites like Red, The Mummy films (Brendan Fraser version), Pirates of the Caribbean films, Lord of Rings films and The Hobbit Films, etc.  Thoroughly enjoyed this one.","displayName":"AllTheWorldsAStage","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T04:53:26.180Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T04:53:26.180Z","user":{"userId":"fdcd3250-e1ff-49d2-995f-f963a53c38f6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"AllTheWorldsAStage","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"}]}
