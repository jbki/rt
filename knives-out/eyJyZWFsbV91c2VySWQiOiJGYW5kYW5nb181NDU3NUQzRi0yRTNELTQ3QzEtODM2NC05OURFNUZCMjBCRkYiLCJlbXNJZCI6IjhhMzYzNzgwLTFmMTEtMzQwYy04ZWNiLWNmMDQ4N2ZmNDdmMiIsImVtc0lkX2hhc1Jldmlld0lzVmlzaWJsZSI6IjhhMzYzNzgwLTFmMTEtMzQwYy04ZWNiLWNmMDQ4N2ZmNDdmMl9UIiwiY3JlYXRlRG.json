Well directed—without the formulaic feeling of old Agatha Christie films. Great performances by Daniel Craig (as the drawling gentleman detective Benoît Blanc), Christopher Plummer (as the august, wily paterfamilias) and excellent Ana de Armas (as the ingenuous prime suspect). Fun cameo by Frank Oz.","displayName":"Liesl S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10152351866612164/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:46:09.686Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:46:21.227Z","user":{"userId":"978484814","realm":"RT","displayName":"Liesl S","accountLink":"/user/id/978484814"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Excellent performance by Daniel Craig","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T21:45:28.115Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T21:45:28.115Z","user":{"userId":"974774173","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/974774173"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A fantastic movie!
