No plot holes come to mind, though some of the events are a little contrived (though the film isn't taking itself totally seriously anyways). The main issue I had was that the 3rd act seemed to lack the same tightness and character-driven focus of the rest of the film - but nothing that would dissuade me from recommending it.","displayName":"Thomas","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T14:40:10.771Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T14:40:10.771Z","user":{"userId":"30EC9ECB-5A46-4290-B8BB-71EDBBB96DF2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Thomas","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Funny, entertaining, and engaging whodunnit!","displayName":"Jon","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T14:36:43.482Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T14:36:43.482Z","user":{"userId":"c930cc06-b356-46ab-9a34-19e3c19f14db","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jon","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I went and watched it with my 12yr old niece & we both enjoyed it.
