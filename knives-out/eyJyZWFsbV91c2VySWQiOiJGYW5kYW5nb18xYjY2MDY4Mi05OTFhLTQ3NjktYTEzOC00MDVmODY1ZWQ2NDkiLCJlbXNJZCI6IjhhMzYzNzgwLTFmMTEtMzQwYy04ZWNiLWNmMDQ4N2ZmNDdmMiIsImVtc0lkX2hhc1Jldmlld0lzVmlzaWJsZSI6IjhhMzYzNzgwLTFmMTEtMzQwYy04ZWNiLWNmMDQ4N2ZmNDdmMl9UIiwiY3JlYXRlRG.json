The beginning was a bit plodding but it is necessary as a preamble to introduce the characters in the plot. Daniel Craig does a really great southern drawl speaking private detective who in the  style of Peter Falk's Columbo kind of stumbles through the movie until the end where he shows his true genius. I don't want to give the plot away but  the only reason I gave the movie only 4 stars is because the beginning was a little slow and really didn't grab my attention. Stick with the movie, it won't let you down.","displayName":"William A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-10T04:34:52.559Z","updateDate":"2019-12-10T04:34:52.559Z","user":{"userId":"86c5a220-30c2-41e0-b2aa-aa1ead5d6b82","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"William A","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"BEST MURDER MYSTERY MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!","displayName":"CameronCCa","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-10T04:34:21.019Z","updateDate":"2019-12-10T04:34:21.019Z","user":{"userId":"2A1035D1-8499-47A7-A748-EF748D8878FA","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"CameronCCa","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This mystery has it all.
