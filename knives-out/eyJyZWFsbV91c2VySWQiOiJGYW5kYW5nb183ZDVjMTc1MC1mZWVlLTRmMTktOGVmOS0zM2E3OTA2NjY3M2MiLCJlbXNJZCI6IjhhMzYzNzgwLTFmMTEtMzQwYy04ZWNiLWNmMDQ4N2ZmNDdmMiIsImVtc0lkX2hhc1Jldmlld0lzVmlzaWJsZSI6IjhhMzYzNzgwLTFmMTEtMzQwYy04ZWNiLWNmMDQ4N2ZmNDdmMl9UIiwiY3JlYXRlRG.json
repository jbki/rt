I thought this film had great sets. I was never sure on characters even from the beginning where they stood. You were constantly second guessing where everyone stood or was committed to who did what and who had what motivations to kill the author. It is a film that ends where you wonder what will happen to the family. I liked the performances and how this story was told.
