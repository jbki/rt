Rian Johnson hasn't made a lot of films in his 15-20 year long career thus far but his work is always high caliber & utterly unique. I'll trade in quantity or quality any day of the week â€” and even though I have no idea what his next film will be about, I'm already excited for it because his creativity is needed more than ever in this era of franchises, sequels, remakes, and such. \n  \nBrick, The Brothers Bloom, Looper, The Last Jedi, and Knives Out. \n\nMost directors would sell their soul for one of those movies to be their brainchild, meanwhile Rian Johnson is just chillin' like, \"Oh hey you're still mad that my Star Wars movie wasn't your fan-fiction? I would apologize but that franchise doesn't belong to you, to say that if the fandom dies the franchise dies is vanity, can you feel that???\"","displayName":"Daniel P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T13:19:24.488Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T13:19:31.464Z","user":{"userId":"969119004","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel P","accountLink":"/user/id/969119004"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Loved the plot twists and the pacing.","displayName":"Karen M-S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T13:14:47.365Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T13:14:47.365Z","user":{"userId":"49d00329-df1a-49f8-9415-d5cd76b3a63e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Karen M-S","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Classic whodunnit!
