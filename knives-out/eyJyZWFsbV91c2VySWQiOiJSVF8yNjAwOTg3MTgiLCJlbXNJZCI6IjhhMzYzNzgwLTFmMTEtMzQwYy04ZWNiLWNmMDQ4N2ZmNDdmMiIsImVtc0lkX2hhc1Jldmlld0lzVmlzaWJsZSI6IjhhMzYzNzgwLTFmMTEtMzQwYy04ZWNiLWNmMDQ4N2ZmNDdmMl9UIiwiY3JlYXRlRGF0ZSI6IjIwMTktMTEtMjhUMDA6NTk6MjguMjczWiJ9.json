Rian Johnson completely flips the \"whodunnit murder mystery\" genre on its head and delivers another one of a kind movie experience. Everyone in the cast is really excellent but the standouts for me are Ana De Armas, Toni Collette and Don Johnson. The movie kept me engaged from beginning to end but not everything worked for me. A lot of the comedy in the movie fell flat for me (some of it felt out of place) but the excellent cast does a magnificent job at elevating every missed bit of humor. Daniel Craig's accent didn't always work for me but he's having so much fun with the role it's hard not to have a good time watching him go all out.","displayName":"anthony m","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T00:49:37.654Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T00:49:39.998Z","user":{"userId":"883287114","realm":"RT","displayName":"anthony m","accountLink":"/user/id/883287114"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Worth its weight in twists","displayName":"Evan C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T00:41:42.191Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T00:41:48.369Z","user":{"userId":"978289802","realm":"RT","displayName":"Evan C","accountLink":"/user/id/978289802"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Rian Johnson has a style and I love it.
