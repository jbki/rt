Not good or bad. I can’t help but be quite disappointed as the trailer and big-name cast had me thrilled to see this. Was too long, a bit boring at times, and I felt it was a waste of such a big-name well-loved cast as they only comprised about 33% of the movie. The acting from the ones that took up the majority of the time was good and believable, but I just wanted more action and more laughs.
