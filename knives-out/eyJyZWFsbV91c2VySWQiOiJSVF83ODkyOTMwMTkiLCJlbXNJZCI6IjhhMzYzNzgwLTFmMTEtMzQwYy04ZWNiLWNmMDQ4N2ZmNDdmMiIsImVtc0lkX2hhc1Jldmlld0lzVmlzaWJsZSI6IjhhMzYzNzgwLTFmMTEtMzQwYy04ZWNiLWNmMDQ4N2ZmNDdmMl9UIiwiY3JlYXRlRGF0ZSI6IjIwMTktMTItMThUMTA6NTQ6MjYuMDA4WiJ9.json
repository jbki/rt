The time it had and the plot, I felt like it was going to be boring, even with the many great actors in it... BUT after going and giving it a chance, I am so happy I did. It’s a movie you need to watch from beginning to end to understand what’s going on. It had its comedic moments and the ending was just mind blowing for me. Still in awe and would watch it again!","displayName":"Natlovesmovies","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-18T08:35:29.845Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T08:35:29.845Z","user":{"userId":"D9DE1637-5248-437D-86C7-0570CF177FE5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Natlovesmovies","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"An outstandingly fresh film.
