No surprise at all, I almost guessed the whole story when I watched for the 1st half hour.\nLet us talk about the story, the \"innocent nurse\".\n1. As a nurse, you should check what medicine you used before injecting. You cannot just say,\"because you are a good nurse, so that you can inject the right medicine without check\" and the prove she is \"good\". That is awful! \n2. The nurse tried to destroy Evidences and interfere with polices from the beginning to the end. You cannot say that she is a good woman just because she tried to save another victim! Interfering polices is already criminal, okay?\n3. Die within 10 minutes. Yep, the old man had even no single symptom after injecting. He even acted smarter. Wow.","displayName":"Cincy ","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1430144290468028/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-07T14:19:54.840Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T14:19:57.555Z","user":{"userId":"978384746","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cincy ","accountLink":"/user/id/978384746"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Mystery to the end and funny!","displayName":"Judy A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T14:11:46.717Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T14:11:46.717Z","user":{"userId":"22cf3047-233a-4155-b87f-7bd3be6efc9a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Judy A","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Movie kept your attention till the end.","displayName":"Cristy M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T14:07:05.677Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T14:07:05.677Z","user":{"userId":"04889ad0-3aca-4fc5-b3b7-42c7f93f344d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Cristy M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"This was a mystery movie first and foremost. Based on reviews and that there was supposed to be lots of comedy, I went to see the movie. For those that like mystery movies, this one is for you. It has a very good ending that ties everything up together with interesting tidbits along the way (the first 10 minutes is slow). For comedy, it had some moments but not anywhere as much as reviews make it seem. So two stars because it was a half way decent movie that brought it home at the end. But for me, it was boring and very uneventful. Now back to some good action movies.","displayName":"Karen B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T14:05:59.143Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T14:05:59.143Z","user":{"userId":"57572720-326E-4C56-8A4C-08D3DC447057","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Karen B","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Fun time, Great actors...Loved Jamie Lee Curtis.","displayName":"Craig  D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T14:02:29.686Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T14:02:29.686Z","user":{"userId":"B4A434B9-2AD8-4BC7-BA5C-22C565C29ABF","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Craig  D","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Loved the movie.
