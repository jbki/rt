Daniel Craig known for his roles in the Bond films does a southernish New York accent which would normally be over the top but for this movie it's the perfect blend for a whodunnit movie. Him and Keith Leskith are a good duo and give two types of insight on the investigation. Christopher Plummer is a very warm presence on screen and while he may be the murder victim he chews scenery like nobody's business. Every character in this movie is amazing. From Jaime Lee Curtis putting on a very loving but strong independent woman who loved her father. To Jaeden Martell who was a silent internet troll. Everyone was amazing in this movie no one was giving anything else but 100%. Chris Evans especially who has been the loving, kind captain America in the MCU is now a trust fund jerk who never has worked a day in his life. And as the story unfolds you can place the pieces together. The movie doesn't do it for you, it makes you think. Don Johnson is a gem in this movie paving threw his scenes hiding a major secret that while is a major part of the story it isn't overshadowing the murder mystery elements. Michael Shannon is also doing an amazing job as the youngest son of Christopher Plummer's character. He can be serious in some scenes but in others just make you laugh. His presence is kind but also intimidating. And Toni Collette. She displays a character who really shouldn't be tied to the family anymore but wants what's best for her daughter (and herself) Collette plays a very \"peaceful\" health-guru and her and her daughter Meg. Katherine Langford have such good chemistry on screen and Langford brings a very emotional performance forward. Finally the caretaker who sees, and knows all their secrets. Marta played by Anna De Armas who shows just how much she deserves more big roles, she stole the show and was a very interesting character to learn about. And while I won't say who but one of the characters has a tendency to throw up when lying it is a tad overplayed. But overall this is just all around a great movie. 10/10","displayName":"Seth F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/511953462614379/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T21:47:25.346Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T21:47:37.486Z","user":{"userId":"977443008","realm":"RT","displayName":"Seth F","accountLink":"/user/id/977443008"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"it keep my mind thinking and the unexpected!","displayName":"H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T21:46:52.224Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T21:46:52.224Z","user":{"userId":"B5BB048E-1867-4617-B500-A53859C6CDB5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"H","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Very entertaining film  though I did guess the drug switch twist almost immediately. Daniel Craig's cornpone PI may have been a bit over the top but all the performances were solid. The plot did get a bit convoluted towards the end and I would liked to have found out where Cabrera was really from  but all in all a satisfying ride.","displayName":"Hardy C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1136104942/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T21:44:27.545Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T21:44:30.990Z","user":{"userId":"909002966","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hardy C","accountLink":"/user/id/909002966"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"}]}
