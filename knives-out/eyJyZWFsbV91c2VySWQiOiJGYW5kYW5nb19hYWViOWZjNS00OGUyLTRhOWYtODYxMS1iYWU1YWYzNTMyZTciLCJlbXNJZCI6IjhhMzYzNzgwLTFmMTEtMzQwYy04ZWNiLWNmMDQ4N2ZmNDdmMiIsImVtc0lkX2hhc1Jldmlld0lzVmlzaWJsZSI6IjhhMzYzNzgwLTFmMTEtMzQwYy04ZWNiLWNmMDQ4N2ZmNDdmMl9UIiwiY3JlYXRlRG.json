On the night of his 85th birthday, a crime novelist (Christopher Plummer) is found dead in his mansion by apparent suicide.  A renowned detective (Daniel Craig) isn't so quick to mark the case as closed, however, and with an entire upset family in the wings, no suspect can be easily eliminated.  We have finally reached that point in the year where all of my most anticipated films are finally hitting theaters.  When Rian Johnson isn't busy angering Star Wars fans, he makes some of my very favorite films, like Brick and Looper, so of course I was excited to see what he could do with a whodunit murder-mystery.  I am very pleased to say that this met my high expectations.  Now, this is one that I would recommend checking out on the colder side.  I personally avoided hearing or reading anything about it short of watching the trailer and knowing the cast list, and I think that's the way to go.  Even though you may be able to foresee a plot element or two coming if you've watched or read enough crime fiction, this still has plenty of surprises that are always revealed in a humorous fashion.  A lot of what I feel makes this work is in the structure.  You walk into this expecting one thing, but then it changes the game and gives you something else.  It then doubles back and gives you what you thought you were going to get in the first place, and at the end of the day, you do get what you came for: you're wildly entertained.  It is just really good storytelling with terrific craft, and a lot of the joy in this is watching the story unfold in front of you. The cast is star-studded, and there really isn't a weak link in this.  If there is a standout, I would have to give it to Daniel Craig as this southern gentleman detective.  He is having the time of his life going big with the drawl in his accent, and whenever he is on screen, you're just waiting to hear what he is going to say next.  At the end of the day, I just didn't want this to have the same conclusion that Murder on the Orient Express did, and they don't do anything like that here.  It keeps spinning this story, and it is terrific at laying breadcrumbs that will pop back up later, almost always in a way that will make you laugh or catch you off guard.  Knives Out is a crowd-pleaser; I had a terrific time watching this play out in a theater, and I'm willing to bet that you will too.","displayName":"John M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/25106477/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T13:51:46.868Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T13:51:48.878Z","user":{"userId":"782214838","realm":"RT","displayName":"John M","accountLink":"/user/id/782214838"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great movie and mystery.
