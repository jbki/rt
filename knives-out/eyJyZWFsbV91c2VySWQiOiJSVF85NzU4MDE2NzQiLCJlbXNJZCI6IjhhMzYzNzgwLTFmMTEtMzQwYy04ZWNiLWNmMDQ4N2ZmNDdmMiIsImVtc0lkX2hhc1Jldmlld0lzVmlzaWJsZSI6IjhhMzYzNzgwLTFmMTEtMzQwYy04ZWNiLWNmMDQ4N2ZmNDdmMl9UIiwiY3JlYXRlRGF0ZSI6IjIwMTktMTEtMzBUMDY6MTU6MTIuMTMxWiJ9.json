Not that i thought this was going to be bad, i just didn't think it was going to be this good. I never let something like a previous movie (The Last Jedi) ruin my potential opinion on a movie, i gave Rian a chance to redeem himself in my eyes (i haven't seen Looper so he wasn't already redeemed in my eyes) and he did it and more. This is probably my favorite Mystery movie to date, or even mystery thing in general. The cast is flawless, one of the best casts I've ever seen for a movie, the cinematography is great, the soundtrack is pretty good - purposefully sounds like a generic mystery movie at first, but also later on has a shift that shows that this is no simple movie - not that it was great and super noticeable with these changes, but it was still a decent scoring. The plot is probably the best thing about the movie other than the cast, everything makes sense in the end and nothing feels like it was there for no reason. In conclusion, go see this movie, idk if it will satisfy you the way it did with me but holy shit did i love it.","displayName":"Brady D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-11-30T06:02:07.590Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T06:02:12.913Z","user":{"userId":"977899146","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brady D","accountLink":"/user/id/977899146"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"it was a delightful romp. a whodunit who didnt take itself too seriously.
