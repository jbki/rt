Almost walked out in the first half and then it picked up a bit in the second half. I will say Daniel Craig did an excellent job and probably saved the movie, but beyond that this one's a snoozefest. But hey. It had a few lukewarm one liners and some subtle humor along with a mild dose of Hollywood politics, so there is that. Should have saved this one for a long plane flight.
