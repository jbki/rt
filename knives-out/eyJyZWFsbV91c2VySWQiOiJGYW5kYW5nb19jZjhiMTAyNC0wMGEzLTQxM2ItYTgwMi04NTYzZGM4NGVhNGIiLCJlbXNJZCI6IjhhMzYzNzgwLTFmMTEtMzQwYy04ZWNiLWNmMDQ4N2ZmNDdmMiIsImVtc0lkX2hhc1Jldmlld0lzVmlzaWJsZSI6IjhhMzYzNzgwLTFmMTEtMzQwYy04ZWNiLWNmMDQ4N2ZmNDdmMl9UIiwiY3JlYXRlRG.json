After private investigator Benoit Blanc enters the fray, he suspects fowl play. What follows is a hilarious investigation with twists and turns that would keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nThe film features an incredible performances from an amazing ensemble cast, most notably a career-best performance from Ana de Armes as Marta, Harlan's friend and nurse from Brazil, Paraguay or Ecuador (depending on which family member you ask) and phenomenal acting from Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc, a private investigator with a slow Southern drawl who has been hired by an anonymous person to investigate Harlan's death.\n\nThe writing keeps you on your toes. Each scene delievering a new piece of information that can't be one-hundred percent trusted. The dialogue with full of wit, effective social commentary, quotable dialogue and clues that become more obvious as the film goes along.\n\nWhile it doesn't hold your hand, the film makes the audience members apart of the investigation in Harlan's death. We learn information as the characters do. And it feels rewarding and satisfying when you discover something.\n\nTrue to Johnson's style, this whodounit doesn't follow the traditional formula. Instead an entertaining and subversive spin on the subgenre. The ending is something so complex and unexpected, it's a massive feat that they managed to pull it off while simultaneously not feeling too confusing to understand.\n\nRian Johnson delievers one of the best movies and most fun movie watching experience of the year with 'Knives Out'. A definite must watch.","displayName":"Mr P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-10T20:32:51.609Z","updateDate":"2019-12-10T20:32:54.481Z","user":{"userId":"975688440","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mr P","accountLink":"/user/id/975688440"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wife and I loved it.
