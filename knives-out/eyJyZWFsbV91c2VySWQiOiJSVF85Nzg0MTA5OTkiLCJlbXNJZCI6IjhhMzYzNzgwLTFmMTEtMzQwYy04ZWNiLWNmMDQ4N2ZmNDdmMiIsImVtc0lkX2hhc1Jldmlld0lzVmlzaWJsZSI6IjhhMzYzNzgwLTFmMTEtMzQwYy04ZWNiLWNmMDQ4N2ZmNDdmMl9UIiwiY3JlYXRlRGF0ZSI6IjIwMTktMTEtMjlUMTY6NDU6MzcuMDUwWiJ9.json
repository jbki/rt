It is one of the best movies we've seen this year. We were totally engrossed from the start. We easily followed the plot as it unfolded and really liked how it wrapped up. No awkward turns either, to get to the conclusion. This was very well written! Won't give out any spoilers here - I usually don't mind knowing spoilers but for this movie it would detract from your enjoyment. Just go see this! It's worth all the high ratings!","displayName":"Nikki S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10218989481641964/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T16:27:49.806Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T16:27:55.764Z","user":{"userId":"978410985","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nikki S","accountLink":"/user/id/978410985"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Knives out is a Fantastic clever and fun film that weaves social commentary in its plot and characters while entertaining and leaving you guessing at every turn.","displayName":"annabella7","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T16:16:10.246Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T16:16:10.246Z","user":{"userId":"2ce3533c-b3cf-41b9-8672-763f125a42f2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"annabella7","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fast-paced, engaging, comedic whodunit with a great twist at the end.
