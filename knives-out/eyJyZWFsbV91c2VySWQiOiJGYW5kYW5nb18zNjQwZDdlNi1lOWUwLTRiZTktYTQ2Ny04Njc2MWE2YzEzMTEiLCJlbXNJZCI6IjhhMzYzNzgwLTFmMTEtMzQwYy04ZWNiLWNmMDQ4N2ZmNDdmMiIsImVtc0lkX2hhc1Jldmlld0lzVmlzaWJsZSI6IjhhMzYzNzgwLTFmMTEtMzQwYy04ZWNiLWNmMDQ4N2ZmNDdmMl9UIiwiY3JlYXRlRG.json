The cast was quirky, the setting was picturesque, and the plot kept me on the edge of my seat. It was a classic whodunnit case with a modern twist. I loved how they revealed what really happened early in the film, and then left the audience waiting for the characters to become involved in the story line. Bonus points for a clever title! A perfect snowy day treat, and a must see!","displayName":"Ali G.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T16:21:00.629Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T16:21:00.629Z","user":{"userId":"652c5c23-154f-4ae9-8a26-07a4a04b79a4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ali G.","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"\"Knives Out\" was such a disappointment to us, despite the stellar collection of actors. We had expected a quirky, laugh out loud, high energy comedy with goofy characters, as in \"Game Night.\"  But to our disappointment, this sluggish, so-called spoof of \"Clue\" and Agatha Christie novels took its so-called \"mystery\" too seriously, leaving it neither amusing nor compelling. The characters were quirky, but ultimately irritating. To our credit, my wife and I did stay for the end -- surely, we thought,  there has to be a satisfying payoff! -- but realized too late there was no payoff, just the gnawing regret that we didn't save ourselves the dignity of redirecting at least 30 minutes of our time that evening toward the viewing of even a 3rd rate unknown film on Netflix.","displayName":"Scott C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T16:20:50.707Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T16:20:50.707Z","user":{"userId":"8694d796-401a-4fc0-b9e9-e8a49e8a2b50","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Scott C","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Fresh and fun!
