It was a movie that had me second guessing, and usually with mystery movies it tends to be quite obvious who the antagonist is, but this one took a little bit longer to figure out. Definitely would watch again.","displayName":"Josh T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-13T04:15:21.160Z","updateDate":"2019-12-13T04:15:21.160Z","user":{"userId":"0cdf2c52-7ae4-4250-a02b-ef3bd0b70829","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Josh T","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was very well done!!!
