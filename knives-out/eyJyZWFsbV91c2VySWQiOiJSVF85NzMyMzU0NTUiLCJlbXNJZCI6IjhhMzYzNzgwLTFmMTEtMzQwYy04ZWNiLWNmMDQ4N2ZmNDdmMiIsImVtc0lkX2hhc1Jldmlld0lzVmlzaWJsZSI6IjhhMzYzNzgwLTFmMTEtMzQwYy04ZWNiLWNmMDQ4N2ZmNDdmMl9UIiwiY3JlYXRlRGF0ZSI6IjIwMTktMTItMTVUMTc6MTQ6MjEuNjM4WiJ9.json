From the opening scene I was delighted. With his keen sense of how to make the moving image cinematic and this tight script infused with humour, I was swept away. Daniel Craig -- apparently taking umbrage with his years of being locked in Bond's 'casual cool' closet -- goes full hilt, bringing his theatrical chops to the forefront, and while he may be acting in his own movie, he does so with such relish, one can't take their eyes away. The film is carefully crafted, impressively so, and despite a slight dragging in the middle third, its neat assembly and creative direction keep us aboard the swiftly moving carriage. Johnson's touch seems to be in the 'delightful twist' -- see Looper, Brick and namely The Brother's Bloom -- taking a genre film and turning things on their head and being cinematically theatrical (yup, I said it) bringing the viewers closer to the film by creating a more visceral viewing experience. And in Knives Out, that's literal, with the near obsession with the close up. What could be more fitting than placing us close to all the culprits in this whodunit, giving us the chance to size these characters up by bringing us eye-to-eye with them, giving us the chance to find out who's lying and who's not. If you're looking for an enjoyable night at the theater, look no further, make the drive and be delighted.","displayName":"Craig N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T17:07:17.967Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T17:07:21.067Z","user":{"userId":"978369296","realm":"RT","displayName":"Craig N","accountLink":"/user/id/978369296"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie!
