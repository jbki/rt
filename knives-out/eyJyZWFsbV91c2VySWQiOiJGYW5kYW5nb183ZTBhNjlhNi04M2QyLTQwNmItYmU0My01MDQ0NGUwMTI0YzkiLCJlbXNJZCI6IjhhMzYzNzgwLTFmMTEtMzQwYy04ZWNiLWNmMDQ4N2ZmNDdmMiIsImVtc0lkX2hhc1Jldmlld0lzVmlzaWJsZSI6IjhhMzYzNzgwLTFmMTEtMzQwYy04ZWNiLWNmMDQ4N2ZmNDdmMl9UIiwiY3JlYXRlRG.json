I went mainly for Chris Evans, Toni Collette, Jaime Lee Curtis, and Lakeith Stanfield (and they did not disappoint despite the very crowded screen), but Christopher Plummer and Ana De Armas were the actors whose performances most delighted me. I also quite enjoyed laughing at the Ben Shapiro-alike.","displayName":"Koujo K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T05:08:00.390Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T05:08:08.864Z","user":{"userId":"977509866","realm":"RT","displayName":"Koujo K","accountLink":"/user/id/977509866"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Smart & funny!

I go to movies to not have to deal this and ended up paying for it to. Had some great actors, but only a couple of good characters. And if you pay attention to the movie along the way it's very predictable. I would suggest to save your time and money, or wait for Netflix and just save the money.","displayName":"Rob H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2327103514177728/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T05:02:45.760Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T05:03:05.764Z","user":{"userId":"977801165","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rob H","accountLink":"/user/id/977801165"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"You just have to see it","displayName":"Jen","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T05:01:33.087Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T05:01:33.087Z","user":{"userId":"956c54a0-df2a-4293-8ea8-e1046cdc5e4d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jen","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"More of a political statement than a campy whodunnit.
