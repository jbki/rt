INCREDIBLE! Everything about it was entertaining. It had an excellent pace. It did a great job developing characters, creating a compelling story, and kept things light-hearted but serious throughout. So many twists and turns that you try to guess, but you are always a step behind. I took off a half star because Daniel Craig's southern accent could not be worse, and as a citizen of the South, it hurt.","displayName":"Chandler R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3040341599352160/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:56:27.129Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:56:31.461Z","user":{"userId":"978386131","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chandler R","accountLink":"/user/id/978386131"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My husband, two teenage boys, 11 year old daughter, and i went to see Knives Out.
