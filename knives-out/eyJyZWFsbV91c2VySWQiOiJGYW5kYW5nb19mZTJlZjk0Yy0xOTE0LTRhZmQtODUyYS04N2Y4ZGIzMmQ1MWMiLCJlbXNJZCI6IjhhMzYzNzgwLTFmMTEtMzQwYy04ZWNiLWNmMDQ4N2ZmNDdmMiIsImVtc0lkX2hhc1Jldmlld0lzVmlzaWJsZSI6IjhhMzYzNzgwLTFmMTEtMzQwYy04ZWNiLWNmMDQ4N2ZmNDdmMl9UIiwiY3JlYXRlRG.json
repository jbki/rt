This murder mystery thriller really hooks you in from the very beginning you start to watch it. Director Rian Johnson (Star Wars: The Last Jedi, yes...that guy) does a great job mixing typical old school mystery tropes with the modern world of today. \n\nI can't say enough about the fantastic cast here. They were all amazing and added their own flavor to the movie. Daniel Craig (as the sleuth), Chris Evans, Jaime Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Christopher Plummer, Ana De Armas (to name a few) all had great chemistry with each other. A truly rich but messed up family by all means. Props to Lakeith Stanfield and Noah Segan who did a great job playing off each other as the detectives.\n\nI can't say enough about this film. Along with the dozen twists and turns you will see, there is also a lot of comedy thrown in to relieve the tension. It's safe to say that this film truly has many elements of a Dark Comedy. My only gripe would be that you better not go to the restroom the whole movie because you'll miss something. \n\nReally fun, entertaining movie, I hope you enjoy finding out who the killer is. FINAL REVIEW 9 out of 10.","displayName":"Daniel A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/560715147/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T23:41:45.135Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T23:43:45.382Z","user":{"userId":"880942050","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel A","accountLink":"/user/id/880942050"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved the movie.
