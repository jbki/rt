It definitely surprised me in the best way and kept me on the edge of my seat. The acting was dynamic and engaging, and the same can be said for the plot. I have one complaint but don't want to say since it would spoil the movie. Overall, I think this was one of the best movies I've seen in a couple years.","displayName":"Madison H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T02:57:25.233Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T02:57:25.233Z","user":{"userId":"4EB103CB-CFED-46A0-9DDD-551A4B2210E4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Madison H","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was a very intelligent creative and humorous suspense movie","displayName":"richard z","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T02:52:28.167Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T02:52:28.167Z","user":{"userId":"EF4A8CB0-4547-4002-AFA6-37287D8D4710","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"richard z","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"This movie is definitely not worth the rating it’s getting.

I generally find that genre deadening.  Not this movie.  The characters have real life about them and don't come across as inconceivable conglomeration of stereotypes all in the same room.  Also, we're not stuck in a room.  But the two people that made it work for me were Daniel Craig as the private dic and Ana de Armas as Marta the nurse.  Plus it's got some comic relief without being comical.","displayName":"Great Holiday, Non-Violent Escape Sleuth Movie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T02:31:14.218Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T02:31:14.218Z","user":{"userId":"c0f31870-5989-4968-8015-7e665e6d840f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Great Holiday, Non-Violent Escape Sleuth Movie","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Fun movie.
