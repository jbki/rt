So I did suspect that Randson who took the nurse out of the mansion to eat and gather thoughts had something to do with the med switch - I had no idea that the msg on the toxicallogy test was not meant for Marta. It scared her and raised many questions. Which the owner of the mansion who told Ransom he would get nothing and it was all going to Marta made me think that he was setting her up to look like she killed Harlan Thrombe. I loved the mug in the film - thought that was cool and for Marta to end up at the end drinking out of it standing on the balcony - great movie and awesome ending!!!","displayName":"Vickie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-14T16:59:56.704Z","updateDate":"2019-12-14T16:59:56.704Z","user":{"userId":"7bec28e4-8cd0-4ae5-81a7-46862545a685","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Vickie","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 14, 2019"}]}
