Rian Johnson's magnificently built whodunit is unbelievably entertaining. With humorous scenes as well as a smart and unpredictable screenplay, \"Knives Out\" messes with your mind. It is a classic old-school murder mystery that is mixed with a modern twist; and even if you manage to piece all of the clues together (which is highly improbable), the joy and satisfaction of seeing it unfold is indescribable. Even though it is somewhat complex, the confusion and frustration just make the experience better. At the end, you feel victorious even though you weren't a part of the movie.","displayName":"Emilio M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T23:30:14.318Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T14:56:09.036Z","user":{"userId":"977904661","realm":"RT","displayName":"Emilio M","accountLink":"/user/id/977904661"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great film!
