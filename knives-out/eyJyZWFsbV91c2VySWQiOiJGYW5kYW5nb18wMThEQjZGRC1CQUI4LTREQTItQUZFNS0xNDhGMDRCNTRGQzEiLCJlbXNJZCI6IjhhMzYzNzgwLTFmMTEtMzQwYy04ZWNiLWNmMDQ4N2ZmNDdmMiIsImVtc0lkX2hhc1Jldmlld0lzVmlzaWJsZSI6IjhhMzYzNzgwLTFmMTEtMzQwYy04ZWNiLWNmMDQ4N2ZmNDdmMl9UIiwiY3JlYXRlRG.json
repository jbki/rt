No doubt about that. It held my attention the whole time by explaining everything out in great picture and detail, however not too much. It has amazing moments, and lots of plot twists to keep you thinking about the whole movie. Once it's over, there's not much to think about, since everything you need is right there. I think it's the best movie this year.","displayName":"Theo H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T21:44:10.414Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T21:44:13.641Z","user":{"userId":"978463781","realm":"RT","displayName":"Theo H","accountLink":"/user/id/978463781"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Liked it a lot but it was really long","displayName":"hlowen01","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T21:43:30.071Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T21:43:30.071Z","user":{"userId":"664F3B23-DFC7-4629-902D-9675B2ADA74D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"hlowen01","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"There where no low parts to the movie.","displayName":"Cheryl","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T21:38:03.947Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T21:38:03.947Z","user":{"userId":"be77b5db-0523-4b46-996d-8879eeca1b1d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Cheryl","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"it's so good it gave me anxiety","displayName":"Angela","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T21:34:46.292Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T21:34:46.292Z","user":{"userId":"75C57A1E-0367-481D-88AE-F9846453B773","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Angela","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a great who done it.
