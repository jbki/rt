The whole movie looked cheap and low budget. All aspects, from lighting to costumes looked amateur and not well done. The plot was poorly written with really good story tossed aside for the least interesting storyline and character...a character who vomits when she lies. Give me a break. The talented cast was wasted on this clunker. Daniel Craig must have owed someone. Rian Johnson is terribly overrated with a bunh of geek \"critics\" giving him strangely favorable ratings. Honestly...this is a movie to save for a plane viewing.","displayName":"Shawn R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T20:56:39.993Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T20:56:39.993Z","user":{"userId":"d030a703-df96-4000-8a4e-c83bfaabd85a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Shawn R","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The most boring whodunnit I've ever seen.
