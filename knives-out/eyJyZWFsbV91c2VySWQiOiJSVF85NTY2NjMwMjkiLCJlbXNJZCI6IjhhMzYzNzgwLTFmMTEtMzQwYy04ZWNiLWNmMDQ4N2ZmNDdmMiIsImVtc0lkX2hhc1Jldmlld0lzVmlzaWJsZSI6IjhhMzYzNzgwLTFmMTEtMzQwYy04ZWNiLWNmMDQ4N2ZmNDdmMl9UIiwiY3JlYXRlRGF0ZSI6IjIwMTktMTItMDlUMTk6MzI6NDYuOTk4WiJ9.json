Excellent acting! Daniel Craig showed his well honed acting moxie as the sleuth extraordinaire. Ana De Armas played her role perfectly and stole the show. There were curve-balls throughout the plot, so nothing was as it seemed. It was great to see Chris Evans play a character outside his Capt America character. He did well. Overall I saw the move with a party of 5 and all of us had a great time.
