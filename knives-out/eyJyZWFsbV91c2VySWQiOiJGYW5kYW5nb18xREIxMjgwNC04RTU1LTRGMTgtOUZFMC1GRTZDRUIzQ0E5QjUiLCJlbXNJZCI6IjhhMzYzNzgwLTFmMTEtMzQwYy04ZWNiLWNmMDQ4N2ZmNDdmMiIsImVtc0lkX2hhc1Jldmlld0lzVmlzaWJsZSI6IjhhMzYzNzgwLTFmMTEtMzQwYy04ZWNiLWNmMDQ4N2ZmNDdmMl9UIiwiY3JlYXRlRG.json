Johnson's execution of the script is entertaining, fun and valuable. Each twist and turn is well placed, however by the end of the movie, it can be rather simple to the audience to solve the mystery themselves. Nonetheless, it is not a negative note that necessarily ruins the movie. The film's ensemble play each of their characters so convincingly that it is rather difficult to point out any real flaws in their individual performances. In the end, KNIVES OUT brings a contemporary take to the mystery genre that is easily enjoyable by most. See you at the movies.","displayName":"Phil P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T06:52:45.293Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T06:52:47.978Z","user":{"userId":"977752466","realm":"RT","displayName":"Phil P","accountLink":"/user/id/977752466"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best who done it in a long time.","displayName":"Kathleen H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T06:33:37.548Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T06:33:37.548Z","user":{"userId":"E6C08C14-39CA-4127-B26D-2DF9E5070B75","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kathleen H","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The funniest part of this movie was the previews.
