I loved Daniel Craig's role as the detective.  His southern drawl was right on point.  All of the actors were excellent in their roles.  Jamie Lee Curtis was great as the matron who protected the family at all costs.  This movie had so many twists and turns that it kept you at the edge of you seat right until the very end of the movie.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic movie.","displayName":"Richard C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-06T12:37:39.900Z","updateDate":"2019-12-06T12:37:39.900Z","user":{"userId":"f09ca7b6-05fd-4149-a743-c6b5d7660eef","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Richard C","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Acting, sets, costumes, all great.
