Great acting. Comical scenes and kept you engrossed the whole time. Well paced with creative plots and twists. The girl next to me kept jumping and squealing during unexpected moments.

I had heard that this movie was amazing, but it ended up exceeding my expectations. Daniel Craig steals the show, and the dialogue is enough to keep you intrigued the whole time. From twists and turns, it had me biting my nails. Such a fun murder mystery experience, and a must see. The trailers don’t even give the full plot, you learn early on that it’s gonna be a different story, and one actor in particular, besides Daniel Craig, is the star of the show.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T05:09:16.785Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T05:09:16.785Z","user":{"userId":"260196828","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260196828"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie captures your attention from the beginning not only with the story but also with the amazing artists it has on it.
