Now about the good aspects of the film, I think humor was great, acting was great (especially by Daniel and Ana), direction was great, the film looked beautiful.\nNow talking about the average aspects of the film, the story is not as clever as it is trying to be. The culprit can be predicted easily. But still the film handles that part nicely so I am gonna let it go.\nNow the worst parts of the film were characters were underutilised. Why do u need such a big cast if the show is just gonna be stolen by Daniel and Ana.\nOverall- I think it was a great movie and I enjoyed my time in the theatre so I will recommend it.\nVerdict- B+","displayName":"Harsh J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T07:44:23.659Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T07:44:23.659Z","user":{"userId":"977125027","realm":"RT","displayName":"Harsh J","accountLink":"/user/id/977125027"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"}]}
