The first 45 minutes or so I was getting nervous as it wasnt very interesting.  But then it got really good!  I sort of wish there was more character development because it was hard to figure out each characters motivation.  I wasnt clear that the housekeeper was the housekeeper until near the end of the movie.  I thought she was a family member. Maybe I missed something.  But it was very entertaining.  It also wasnt clear where Danial Craigs character was from.  Again I may have missed something but he was fun nonetheless.  Must see!  We took our 13 year old and other than some foul language, it was age appropriate for her.","displayName":"Theresa H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T12:23:11.509Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T12:23:11.509Z","user":{"userId":"536da54f-872d-4896-ab4a-f2db896fb58f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Theresa H","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Most entertaining movie Iâ€™ve seen in a long time.","displayName":"Wesley","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T12:07:41.502Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T12:07:41.502Z","user":{"userId":"40637055-BB2A-4E7B-B848-7AFF54A86D56","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Wesley","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great cast, very funny and twists throughout!","displayName":"Michelle B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T11:36:15.601Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T11:36:15.601Z","user":{"userId":"203fa081-c86f-4ead-82cb-60ec8d3a2b75","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michelle B","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great who done it movie.","displayName":"david","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T11:35:45.725Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T11:35:45.725Z","user":{"userId":"e4752313-4051-4b61-ad2f-4acc020dfd7b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"david","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Really fun film to get into and try to solve as it's happening, definitely hope we get to see more of this universe in other films starring Daniel Craig and with Rian Johnson's directing.","displayName":"Kason P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T11:28:08.659Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T11:28:08.659Z","user":{"userId":"EBB6337F-480F-4BE9-AA77-1D9EE168CB73","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kason P","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Fine acting and a good story but with no likeable characters it ends up with the feel of a made for TV movie","displayName":"1000MoviesAndCounting","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T10:48:41.813Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T10:48:41.813Z","user":{"userId":"361af288-63c5-4b3e-b4bf-2570659a1646","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"1000MoviesAndCounting","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"very positive characters.
