I find mysteries often have to do a little cheating to keep its audience off balance, but not so here. Knives Out doles out huge reveals early on, only to keep the mystery afoot with some clever narrative backtracking and subtle dialogue that keeps the audience guessing as to the characters motivations.\n\nI wont say more about the plot. Daniel Craig is superb as the last of the gentleman detectives, as one character puts it, whose delightfully over-the-top southern accent sets the tone for the rest of the cast. Other standouts are Jaime Lee Curtis and Michael Shannon. Finally, Ana de Armas anchors the movie as the hapless nurse ensnared in a dysfunctional family feud.\n\nMore than just a murder mystery, Knives Out clearly has something to say about what unchecked privilege can do to the soul, a message that should click with modern audiences.\n\nI dont usually gush, but this was a fun movie. Check it out.","displayName":"Dave","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T01:33:05.842Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T01:33:05.842Z","user":{"userId":"cc363686-3b2f-431c-9752-e7000f1b6c1e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dave","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was clever, well-directed, and well-performed.
