I have to say, I came into this movie thinking it was gonna be Clue but with some deviations to make it seem original, but it was certainly not that at all. Through the whole movie, I felt like I knew who the murderer was, then there a point where its switched my mentality of not just who the murderer is but caring for certain characters and hoping they make it out okay. There is social commentary in the film, but not to the extend of taking a side. To me, they made fun of the both extremes (conservatives and liberals). Danial Craig and Ana De Armas were the stand outs. They added tons of funny/comedic moments, but not forcing anything. Craig and Armas also had plenty of dramatic moments that made you care for their characters. To be honest though, this assemble cast did an amazing job. It's defiantly worth a watch but it wouldn't be a film I watch every year.","displayName":"isaac k","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T19:31:24.469Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T23:30:24.725Z","user":{"userId":"970078107","realm":"RT","displayName":"isaac k","accountLink":"/user/id/970078107"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"awesome mystery! keeps you thinking to the very end!","displayName":"Trish","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T19:29:41.152Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T19:29:41.152Z","user":{"userId":"484C48C9-1A3A-4977-9A4F-8E1E26CA44DC","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Trish","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Really enjoyable whodunnit.","displayName":"Mr Sir","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T19:08:39.874Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T19:08:39.874Z","user":{"userId":"AFAF2836-40FF-4D3D-8E01-E682A2CCE08D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mr Sir","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Kept you guessing until the very end","displayName":"Cincinnati","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T19:03:25.114Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T19:03:25.114Z","user":{"userId":"4adf6a87-121f-48b3-bae2-82ad892f6005","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Cincinnati","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good plot twists and entertaining performances and script.
