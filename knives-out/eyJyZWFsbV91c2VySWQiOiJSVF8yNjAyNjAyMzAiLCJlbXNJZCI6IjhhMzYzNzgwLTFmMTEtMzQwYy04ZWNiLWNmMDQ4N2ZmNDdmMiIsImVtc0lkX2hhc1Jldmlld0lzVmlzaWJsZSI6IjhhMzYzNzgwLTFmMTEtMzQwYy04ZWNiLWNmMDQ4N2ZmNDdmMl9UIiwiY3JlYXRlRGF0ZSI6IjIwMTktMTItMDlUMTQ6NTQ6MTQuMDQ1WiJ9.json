It's a traditional, even old school, whodunit murder mystery. There are the usual pack of suspects and it generally follows the genre, with Daniel Craig playing the sleuth.  There's a twist in the middle the shakes things up a bit.  On the positive side, the director does a decent job giving all the actors airtime to somewhat develop their characters and to flesh out their motives. The writing is good and there are a few funny bits.  The acting is pretty good, though they pale next to the great Christopher Plummer. Ana de Armas plays the protagonist and does a fine job, though she seems to stand around, staring, a fair bit.  Daniel Craig is very good, though I found his character's southern drawl off-key.  Overall, it was a decent flick for me, though it's really rental if I could do it over again.  My wife was disappointed and gave it a \"5/10\".","displayName":"P M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-09T14:33:21.023Z","updateDate":"2019-12-09T14:33:32.406Z","user":{"userId":"900943420","realm":"RT","displayName":"P M","accountLink":"/user/id/900943420"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent movie!
