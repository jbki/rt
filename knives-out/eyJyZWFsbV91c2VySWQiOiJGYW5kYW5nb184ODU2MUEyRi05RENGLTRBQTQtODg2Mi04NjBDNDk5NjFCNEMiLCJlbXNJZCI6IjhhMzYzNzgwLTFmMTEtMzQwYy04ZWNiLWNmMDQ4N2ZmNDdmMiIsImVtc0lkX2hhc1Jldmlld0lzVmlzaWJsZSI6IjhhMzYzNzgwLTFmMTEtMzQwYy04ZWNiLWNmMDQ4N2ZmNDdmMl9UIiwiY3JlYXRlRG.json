But a murder investigation takes place when many members of his family and his nurse have motives for killing him and its down to detective Benoit Blanc ( Daniel craig) to figure this confusing case out. Wow what a phenomenal and clever film i could find no flaws. Lets talk about what made this film so fantastic.\n\nI have to start with the fantastic mise en scene cinematography. There was one clever line in the film that said that the Thrombey household manor looked like a massive cluedo board,and that's exactly what it looked like. The house was so big and had so many different parts to it that you didn't know where all the evidence could be. And there was so many different hidden doors and windows that increased the intrigue and entertainment value of the movie. And there was just so  many clever uses of cinematography involving Daniel Craigs character that was fantastic. Including the wheel of knives and when he lit a cigarette and you could only see the fire and not his face. using low key lighting very effectively.\n\nNext the film was very funny and its mysterious tone was fantastic. The films humour was very clever in making you think one thing but then it being the complete opposite to what you thought. And also Daniel craigs charecter bought a lot of witty humour,the whole cast was funny in there own ways,due to them being oblivious as to how selfish and stupid they sound. i found this very amusing especially with Toni Calettes character.\n\nAnd also the script was fantastic,and the plot twists were perfectly executed. Wow the script was incredibly clever and in my opinion deserving of oscars. It consistently kept you entertained and invested in the story. And made you constantly ask questions about the film that was always answered and developed therefore leaving you very satisfied. It also had good social and political commentary as well. And the films plot twists was fantastic. The film completely turned the murder mystery on its head about halfway through the film which i love. But also it did such a convincing job at convincing you who killed the main character. But then it out of the blue was Chris Evans charecter which came as a complete surprise to me.\n\nAnd my final few main positives are the cast,performances and a the key standout performance of Daniel Craig. Can we all just appreciate one of the most impressive casts i have seen in a film in a long time. With so many big names everyone got there moment to shine which was great. And all the performances from everyone was solid. Especially Toni collete who played her annoying character perfectly. And Jamie lee curitis who also played her arrogant character very well with some humourous moments. And two of the three leads Chris Evans and Ana De armas did fantastic and convincing jobs in portraying the murderer and the falsely accused killer. But for me the main standout was Daniel Craig. He really made this film fantastic. Whether it was just the pure skill and talent that his character had as a detective. Or his witty humour and his fantastic accent he really made this movie.\n\nOverall Knives out is a truly fantastic. Clever and well put together movie. With fantastic performances and an incredibly well thought out and inquisitive script that deserves oscar nominations. And is truly my favourite movie of the year and up there with the best i have ever seen.","displayName":"Ryan N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T20:22:14.532Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T20:22:17.617Z","user":{"userId":"977600075","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan N","accountLink":"/user/id/977600075"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"intense ! \nPlot twists !\nüëç üëç üëç","displayName":"hannah.d","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T20:21:43.145Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T21:05:29.325Z","user":{"userId":"BE5D6FD9-0505-4B15-AB3B-B6800E633FFB","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"hannah.d","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Slow first 3/4.
