No no no, not for Knives Out - for The Last Jedi. There is no way you deserve all of the credit for the disastrous Star Wars entry from 2017 when you made a movie as utterly fantastic as Knives Out. I'm a sucker for a film with well done plot twists and adore murder mysteries when they're done well, but to say this was only done well would be a disservice. I mean the witty dialogue, the hilarious and spot on performances of the ensemble led by Daniel Craig and the genuine tension and intrigue you feel when watching make for such an entertaining watch. It's able to smoothly transition tones when it wants to and is such a classic-like murder mystery with a modern twist. This was such a fun watch and I can't wait to see it again, Rian Johnson isn't exactly a beloved filmmaker after directing the already mentioned movie - and maybe his style just better suits a story like this rather than Star Wars. Additionally actors and actresses largely play against type, Craig certainly isn't playing a copy of James Bond and Chris Evans certainly isn't playing Captain America, Johnson's script must have been so good that it allowed these established performers to really slip into their roles. What else can I say? Go see Knives Out!","displayName":"Corbin K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T05:13:42.510Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T05:13:43.741Z","user":{"userId":"978112576","realm":"RT","displayName":"Corbin K","accountLink":"/user/id/978112576"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Entertaining as hell.
