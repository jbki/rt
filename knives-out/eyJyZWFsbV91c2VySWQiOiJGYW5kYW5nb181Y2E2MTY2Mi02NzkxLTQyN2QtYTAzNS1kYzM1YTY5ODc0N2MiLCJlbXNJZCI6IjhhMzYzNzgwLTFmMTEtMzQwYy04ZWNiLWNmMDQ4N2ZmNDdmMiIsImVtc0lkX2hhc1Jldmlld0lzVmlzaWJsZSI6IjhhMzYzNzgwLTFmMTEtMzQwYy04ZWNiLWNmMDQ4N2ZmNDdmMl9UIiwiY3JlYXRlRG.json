Yes, there was an SJW message strung throughout the entire film. And, yes, you can see a lot of it coming from a mile away. But it was still an amazing viewing experience.

Enjoyed a complex plot that doesn't begin to come clear until the last few minuets of the movie.  Daniel Craig plays and excellent investigator without his real British accent. The characters in the film all seem to have a reason to get Christopher Plumber's fortune. No spoilers here.

It was interesting to start with the murder already happened and then unravel from there. The acting, writing, and cinematography was superb. My only complaint is that there wasnt much to the kids character at all. I would have liked a thorough dive into each character there and their motives. Make it look like arch one of them were guilty so any one of them could have done it. I secretly hope that they did film it with multiple endings just like Clue. Only time will tell.","displayName":"Rab787","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T18:05:57.759Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T18:05:57.759Z","user":{"userId":"bce648f8-0173-4d0a-88a5-b5a0c4f44a50","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rab787","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Very funny with lots of twists and turns.","displayName":"Sue","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T17:59:41.335Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T17:59:41.335Z","user":{"userId":"0808e5bf-aa2b-4f31-8332-f1560edb9432","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sue","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Slow to develop but had a good twist to the ending","displayName":"Harold","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T17:56:06.951Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T17:56:06.951Z","user":{"userId":"12689812-f9cb-4433-867c-9747849c6613","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Harold","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"45 min mystery.

However, most current movies just don't appeal to us for many different reason. We know we are not the demographic the producers are trying to sell to.  However, this movie was fun, entertaining and we enjoyed all the characters.  It is a good old fashioned murder mystery with a great caste and good story line.  It kept our attention the entire film.  Things are not what the initially seem to be.","displayName":"John M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T17:53:24.405Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T17:53:24.405Z","user":{"userId":"90da552f-8df9-43e4-9b8c-f3b074f42eea","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"John M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What a fantastic ride. You've probably seen a \"Whodunnit\" film in the past, but this one is so fresh and funny that you'll stop wondering about the \"Who\" and just enjoy the film.
