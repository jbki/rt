What I got was a sloppily written, contrived, tonally confused slop fest that wasted the great talent of what should've been a great cast. The only performance that stood out was Chris Evans', which is an easy feat to accomplish given the rest of the casts subpar performances, clearly a result of subpar directing. So good job, Rian. You definitely subverted my expectations since I expected an even tolerable film. \nHonestly the worst part of this is that Rian had an ending within his grasp that would've been, while obvious, better than the misfire ending it did have.\nAnd worse than THAT is you just KNOW that the idea for the slightly more obvious, but better, ending did cross his mind and he decided against it while sitting in his chair sniveling to himself \"hehehe  I'm subverting their expectations\"\nThe only reason it doesn't get a half a star rating is because there were a few couple funny quips and the ending did make me laugh (Once again because of Chris Evans).\nSkip this film, or don't because clearly people will put up with anything these days if they're told by someone else that it's \"smart\".","displayName":"Joseph T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/477827982841008/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-10T06:19:10.095Z","updateDate":"2019-12-10T06:19:26.233Z","user":{"userId":"978425824","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph T","accountLink":"/user/id/978425824"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it.
