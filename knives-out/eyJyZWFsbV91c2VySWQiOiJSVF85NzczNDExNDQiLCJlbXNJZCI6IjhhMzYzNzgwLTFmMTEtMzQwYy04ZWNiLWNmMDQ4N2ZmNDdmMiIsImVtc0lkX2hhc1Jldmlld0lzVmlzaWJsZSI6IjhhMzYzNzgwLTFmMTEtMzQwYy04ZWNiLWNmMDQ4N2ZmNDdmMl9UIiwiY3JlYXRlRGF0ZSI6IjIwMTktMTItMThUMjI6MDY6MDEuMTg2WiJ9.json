A smartly written whodunit movie that manages to be both humorous and classy. The kind of murder mystery that never fails to entertain. Pleasing both cinephiles and mainstream audiences. Perfectly balance, as all things should be. It basically pulls a Hitchcock on us.\n\nRian Johnson is a great director, but at times has silly ideas. On the other hand, when given the right material I think he's a great director and writer. He's also a clever man, but never came off as annoying. The dialogue was so sharply written that I could tell the cast loved every minute of soaking up and delivering these lines. The cinematography was nothing short but beautiful and will often linger in rooms of the house which helps the audience immerse in the overall setting.\n\nOne of the tightest scripts of the year with raw humor and a satisfying mystery/comedy.\n\nThe cast is stellar, but the main stand outs for me were Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, and Chris Evans. I loved Daniel Craig's Southern drawl which I didn't expect at first, but I was amazed of how far he went for it. Often times it reminded me of Frank Underwood from ‘House of Cards'. He plays detective Benoit Blanc, AKA CSI: KFC. At one point during the movie he delivers one of the funniest monologues in the entire movie, which was brilliantly delivered by Craig. He should seriously try out more comedy roles.\n\nDose anyone remember when Ana de Armas starred in Eli Roth's ‘Knock Knock'? Well look at her now. She was absolutely excellent in this movie. The running joke throughout the entire movie is her character can't lie and whenever she dose, she vomits on the spot. How ironic, yet I love the comedic irony behind it.\n\nChris Evans plays a spoiled child with a slimy grin during the worst situations. The over privilege black sheep of the family. This is very against type for Evans, especially when his character hates dogs, which I would imagine being difficult for Evans since he's a dog lover in real life. Also the different sweaters he wears in every scenes was impeccable.\n\nThe rest of the cast manage to shine individually in this crowded movie. Although at times some of them felt like background wall paper compared to others. However that never takes away from what else ‘Knives Out' has to offer.\n\nToni Collette dose a great impression of Gwyneth Paltrow. Michael Shannon plays a wimpy son to a crime-writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). Despite the small screen time, Plummer is still charming as always. While Jamie Lee Curtis and her character brings the dramatic elements into play. She's uninterested in the humorous quarrel during the grim situation, as early on she reminds everyone that her father just died.\n\nJudging it as a whodunit mystery, the pay off itself is slick. The events leading to the death are revealed early into the movie, and instead Johnson remains steps ahead from the audience. There's an underlining social commentary beneath the foul play. The themes of privilege and underprivileged with the sour taste of bitterness throughout. Nothing deep or new, but at least is trying to say something rather than being one thing.\n\nOverall rating: My House. My Rules. My Coffee!!!","displayName":"Matthew L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000196775387/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-18T21:38:15.022Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T21:38:16.968Z","user":{"userId":"931412053","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew L","accountLink":"/user/id/931412053"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great story, awesome character development and a spectacular game of clue","displayName":"Korinne","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-18T21:37:16.620Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T21:37:16.620Z","user":{"userId":"D8832B89-2E83-41D1-A460-E65AE51B14F0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Korinne","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good mystery plot.
