Too much time is spent with the nurse, Marta. She is a fine actress- but cmon- if you have Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette- USE them! The mystery aspect is not satisfying. Is a true whodunit a thing of the past because audiences or movies have dumbed down? There were some good laughs. Some interesting characters that were introduced but not fleshed out. Its a fine holiday outing, but not a must go.","displayName":"Mina","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T11:31:06.989Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T11:31:06.989Z","user":{"userId":"5c5a2cb4-d8b9-48f3-9676-d85b37ae32aa","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mina","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Nice to see a good smart movie.","displayName":"Sheila E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T11:25:06.151Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T11:25:06.151Z","user":{"userId":"b874f327-78b3-488d-a1a1-9e56d0ab441e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sheila E","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie.
