A far cry from 007 for Daniel Craig, he was exceptional. Usually can figure out these movies about 1/4 of the way through, not this one. The performances where all great. The audience, a full house ranged from 16-70's, all left entertained! I would recommend it to anyone. Just enough laughs mixed into the mystery.","displayName":"Mike V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T00:57:23.222Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T00:57:29.575Z","user":{"userId":"977750967","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike V","accountLink":"/user/id/977750967"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Enjoyed very much.
