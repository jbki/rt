Yes, a show indeed! This 21st century clue is an enjoyable ride. The music is fun too, right up until the credits roll. The director and editor were sure to give their audience both dark and warm humor with perfect timing. Oh of course Daniel Craig is outstanding with his English-turned southern drawl and piercing blue eyes. You think you know who-dun-it until...the plot thickens. A roller coaster ride no but strong relation to several classics.","displayName":"leannd00","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T05:58:52.209Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T05:58:52.766Z","user":{"userId":"9887bd5a-bc14-44c2-8e8e-2100777710e0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"leannd00","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great ensemble, fun & clever reinvention of Agatha Christie-style mystery.
