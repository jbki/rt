The cast absolutely killed it, Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig being the clear standouts.  From a technical standpoint, the editing, cinematography, and score were perfect.  I wish we could have spent more time with the Thromby family because some of the best scenes were when they were all together in one room going after each other.
