It is nothing like you predicted. It is totally a fresh new take on the whodunnit genre. The cast was incredibly fabulous. All of them were hilariously talented. The looks and feels of the film were stunning too. Rian Johnson is such genius. I've seen it twice already and I don't mind go and see it again.","displayName":"Mohammed Ahmed M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T13:29:56.289Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T06:25:48.637Z","user":{"userId":"901282313","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mohammed Ahmed M","accountLink":"/user/id/901282313"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I felt the movie lacked some identity, It didn't seem as though Johnson wasn't sure if he was making a comedy or a drama. The drama wasn't intense enough for the comedy to feel like breaks in the tension but the movie wasn't funny enough to be a comedy. The whodunnit aspect of the film is enjoyable, the acting is phenomenal, but the inter-family relationships were presented as interesting material to develop or expand on but that fell a little short as well. Watchable and entertaining but I left wanting more and not in the good way.","displayName":"Brent H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T13:22:28.694Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T13:22:28.694Z","user":{"userId":"118768c3-4eb2-433e-a511-c64cdd1b3a77","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Brent H","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie, w lots of twists & turns to find the killer.","displayName":"Rich","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T13:11:46.966Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T13:11:46.966Z","user":{"userId":"b3bfc398-f4e2-48bd-8778-0ba98126cbd8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rich","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This was a poorly written/executed movie.
