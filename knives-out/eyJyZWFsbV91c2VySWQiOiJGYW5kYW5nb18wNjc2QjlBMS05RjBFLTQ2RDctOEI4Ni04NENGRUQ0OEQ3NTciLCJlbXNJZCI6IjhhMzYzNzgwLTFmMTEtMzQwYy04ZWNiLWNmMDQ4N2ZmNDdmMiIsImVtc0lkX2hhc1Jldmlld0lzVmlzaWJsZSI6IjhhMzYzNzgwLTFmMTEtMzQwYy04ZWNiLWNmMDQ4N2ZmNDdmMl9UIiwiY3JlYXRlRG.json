Knives Out is a mystery murder crime film which you will have a lot of fun with this Clue like concept as Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) tries to solve a murder. This kind of film reminds me like Murder at the Orient Express. But a little more fun and entertaining. Rian Johnson direction and his witty script makes this movie worth watching. It is fun, there are surprises, and twist and turns. The plot follows Harlan (Christopher Plummer) who is a patriarch and owns a lot. After he was mysteriously found dead and presumed it was a suicide. A private investigator Benoit Blanc is hired to solve the mystery. With the family being on the will and are wanting their share of Harlan's property and company. Blanc believes there is a suspect that is at large within the family. The film's plot is a little slow moving. It is a lot of fun. Blanc interviewing every family member Ranson (Chris Evans) who is the black sheep of the family. Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her husband Richard (Don Johnson). Walt (Michael Shannon). Meg (Katherine Langford). Jacob (Jaeden Martell). Joni (Toni Collette). And their house nanny Marta (Ana de Armas). The cast ensemble was great. The performances are fun and entertaining. The film is filled with surprises with twist and turns. Definitely best seeing without reading or looking up spoilers about it. I would love to see another movie of this. Overall, Knives Out is a really good film. If you are into the murder mystery kind of movie. This would be it.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-14T04:11:00.132Z","updateDate":"2019-12-14T04:11:00.132Z","user":{"userId":"260001649","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260001649"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Highly entertaining with phenomenal cast and good writing.","displayName":"Bruce C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-14T04:10:40.014Z","updateDate":"2019-12-14T04:10:40.014Z","user":{"userId":"d93b6165-6ec3-41a7-9ce8-65ba61a677a0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bruce C","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A who done it, you know who done it, are you you sure who done it, wait what!
