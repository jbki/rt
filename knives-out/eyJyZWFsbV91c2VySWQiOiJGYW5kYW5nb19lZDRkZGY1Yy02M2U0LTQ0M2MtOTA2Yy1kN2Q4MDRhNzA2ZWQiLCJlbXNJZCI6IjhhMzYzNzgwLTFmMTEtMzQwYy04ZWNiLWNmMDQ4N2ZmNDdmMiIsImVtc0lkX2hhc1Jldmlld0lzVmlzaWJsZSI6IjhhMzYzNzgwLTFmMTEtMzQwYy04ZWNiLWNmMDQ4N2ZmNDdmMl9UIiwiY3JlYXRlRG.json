I enjoyed the film in a packed cinema whose patrons whose collective reactions  ranged from laughter to groans.  The acting was superb, especially Daniel Craig's thick-as-molasses drawl, the direction was smart, and the crazy screenplay had enough twists to satisfy any fan of the mystery genre.  I may see it again just to savor the car chase.","displayName":"Sherilyn","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T11:35:19.717Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T11:35:19.717Z","user":{"userId":"a42df3d5-62d1-45a3-a3ee-74dd54216154","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sherilyn","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"It was so bad, I can't even explain how bad it was","displayName":"Silviu L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2119939758091063/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T11:34:52.468Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T11:34:55.473Z","user":{"userId":"977810496","realm":"RT","displayName":"Silviu L","accountLink":"/user/id/977810496"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"}]}
