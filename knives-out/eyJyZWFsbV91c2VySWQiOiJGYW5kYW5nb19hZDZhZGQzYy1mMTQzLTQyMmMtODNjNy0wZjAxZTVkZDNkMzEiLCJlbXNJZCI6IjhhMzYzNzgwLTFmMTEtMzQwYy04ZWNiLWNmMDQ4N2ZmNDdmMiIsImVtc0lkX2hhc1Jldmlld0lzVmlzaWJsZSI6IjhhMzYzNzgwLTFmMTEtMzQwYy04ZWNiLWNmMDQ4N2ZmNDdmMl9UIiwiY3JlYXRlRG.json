It reminds me of a Sherlock Holmes but the book version on film. It had pretty good humor and it had you wondering if you are being tricked yourself.\n\nOverall the movie has some well known heavy actors, so the acting was not an issue in my opinion, but not the best mystery movies I've seen but it was interesting , it had a good amount of soft humor and some action. \n\nif you are into mystery movies then you would enjoy watching thins in movie theater, may not be your favorite but worth it. If you not a big mystery crime movie fan then this would be great Netflix or red box.\n\nMaybe a Spoiler: But I think this is first mystery movie I didn't predict the ending because it wasn't trying to be so mysterious that you actually could tell what was going to happen, I think the ending is so predictable you wouldn't predict it, but in a good way...\n\nAlso I didnt fall inlove with main character, she was sweet but I wasnt rooting for her as much as for the detective and the father, but you always wanted her to out do the family, so she was likable in that manner.","displayName":"Wayne H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T09:28:54.181Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T09:28:57.929Z","user":{"userId":"978413907","realm":"RT","displayName":"Wayne H","accountLink":"/user/id/978413907"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll find out who dun it","displayName":"x_x","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T09:07:35.013Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T09:07:35.013Z","user":{"userId":"CBDA4D37-58F6-4306-B4B4-687B18ECEC31","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"x_x","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The whole theater erupted with applause when this movie was over.
