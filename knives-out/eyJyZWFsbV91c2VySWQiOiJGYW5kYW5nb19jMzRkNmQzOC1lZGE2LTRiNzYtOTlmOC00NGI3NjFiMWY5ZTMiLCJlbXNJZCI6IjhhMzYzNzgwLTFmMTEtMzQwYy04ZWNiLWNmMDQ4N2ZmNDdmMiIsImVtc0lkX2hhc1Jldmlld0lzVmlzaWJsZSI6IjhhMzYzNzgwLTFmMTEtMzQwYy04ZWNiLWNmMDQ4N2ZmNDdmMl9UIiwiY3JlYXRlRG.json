My wife kept falling asleep. The development for the first hour was poorly executed.The second hour was fantastic and made up for the lousy first hour. It was almost like two different movies. We left thinking it was a pretty good movie... Not the best movie of 2019 as some have stated, but pretty good...","displayName":"Mike Schilling","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T02:14:41.764Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T02:14:41.764Z","user":{"userId":"5815d86d-c464-459e-a0a8-5e8c6689d89a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mike Schilling","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Very good, entertaining movie, with a good story and good acting ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T02:14:25.921Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T02:15:28.489Z","user":{"userId":"260006486","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260006486"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A very well written, and directed murder mystery like none you've ever seen.
