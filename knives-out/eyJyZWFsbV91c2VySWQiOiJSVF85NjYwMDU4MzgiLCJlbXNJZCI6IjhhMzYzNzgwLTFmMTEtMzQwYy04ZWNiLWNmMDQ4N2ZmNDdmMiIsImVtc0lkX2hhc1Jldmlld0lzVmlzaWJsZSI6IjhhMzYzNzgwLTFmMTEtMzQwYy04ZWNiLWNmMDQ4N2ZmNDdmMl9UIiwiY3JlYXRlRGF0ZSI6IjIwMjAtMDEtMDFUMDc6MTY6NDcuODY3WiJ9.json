But no.  Disappointed by promise of witty writing not delivered. Too long verging on boring. Tedious and tiresome cliche premise.  Admittedly much of the audience laughed at slightly humorous moments and didn't seem to mind. I think this audience was desperate to get out and are unfamiliar with actually good movies. The reasons for its highly rated review truly escape me.","displayName":"Cynthia S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T06:28:13.603Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T06:29:17.359Z","user":{"userId":"978495611","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cynthia S","accountLink":"/user/id/978495611"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good story and kept you guessing but plot line was slow in certain spots.","displayName":"Janette G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T06:26:45.185Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T06:26:45.185Z","user":{"userId":"C8CE8249-958A-4FC2-8415-EB6FE9B66856","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Janette G","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"OMG, this movie is worth every bit of the 97% on rotten tomatoes.
