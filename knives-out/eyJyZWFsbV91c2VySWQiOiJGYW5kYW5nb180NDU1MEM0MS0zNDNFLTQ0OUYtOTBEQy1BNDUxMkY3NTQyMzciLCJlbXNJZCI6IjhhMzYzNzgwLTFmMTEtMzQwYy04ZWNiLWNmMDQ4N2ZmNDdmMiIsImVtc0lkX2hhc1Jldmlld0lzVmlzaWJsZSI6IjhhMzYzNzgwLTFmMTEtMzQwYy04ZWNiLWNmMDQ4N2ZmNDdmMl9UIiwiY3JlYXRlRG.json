It's a murder plot of course and if you like your characters drawn more from Agatha Christie (Murder On The Orient Express) rather than Thomas Harris (Silence of the Lambs) then you'll love this light-hearted, often comical, version of crime. But, the break out star here is Ana de Armas, who goes through a myriad of emotions and steals the show. Her huge eyes convey emotions, innocence, grief, and anger with uncanny ability. Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson give their best performances in years, and Michael Shannon once again, plays sleeze as well as anyone can.","displayName":"patrick k","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T16:57:03.051Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T16:57:03.051Z","user":{"userId":"b4cfa57e-463b-48d8-99a9-bfa4fdc8c131","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"patrick k","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"contrived, overtly political with caricature dialogue making the cast look like a bunch of C-listers","displayName":"James M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T16:54:38.794Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T16:54:52.383Z","user":{"userId":"976980250","realm":"RT","displayName":"James M","accountLink":"/user/id/976980250"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was great fun, and lots of laughs.","displayName":"Keith R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T16:54:35.150Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T16:54:35.150Z","user":{"userId":"09d857e3-f16a-4faa-bce3-7e5d6a0cbeb7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Keith R","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was great.
