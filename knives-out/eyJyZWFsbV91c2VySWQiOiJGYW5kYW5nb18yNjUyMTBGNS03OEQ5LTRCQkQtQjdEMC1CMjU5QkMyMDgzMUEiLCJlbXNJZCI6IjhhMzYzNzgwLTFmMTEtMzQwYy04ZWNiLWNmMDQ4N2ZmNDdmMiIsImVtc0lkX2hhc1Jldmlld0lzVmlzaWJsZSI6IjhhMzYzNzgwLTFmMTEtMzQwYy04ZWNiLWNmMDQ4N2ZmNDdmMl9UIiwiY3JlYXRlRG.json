Daniel Craig is quite entertaining as Detective Blanc with his bumbling nature and slow southern drawl.  The plot keeps you guessing even after the murder is revealed.  Bloodsucking freeloader family members add to the mystery each with their own motive.  Great cast, fun movie reminicent of Agatha Christy and the game Clue.  Clean, entertaining, witty and sharp, great for the whole family!  Hollywood, please make more of this kind of movie!","displayName":"Mari L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T16:35:52.172Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T16:35:52.172Z","user":{"userId":"36ea68e3-dc66-4881-9100-68292024ba1b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mari L","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Fun ensemble movie.

A little too long. Hilarious when Daniel Craig opened his mouth and, what comes out but a really goofey Southern accent. The entire audience laufghed out loud, Funnier stil, he sliped in and out of it with an American accent.
