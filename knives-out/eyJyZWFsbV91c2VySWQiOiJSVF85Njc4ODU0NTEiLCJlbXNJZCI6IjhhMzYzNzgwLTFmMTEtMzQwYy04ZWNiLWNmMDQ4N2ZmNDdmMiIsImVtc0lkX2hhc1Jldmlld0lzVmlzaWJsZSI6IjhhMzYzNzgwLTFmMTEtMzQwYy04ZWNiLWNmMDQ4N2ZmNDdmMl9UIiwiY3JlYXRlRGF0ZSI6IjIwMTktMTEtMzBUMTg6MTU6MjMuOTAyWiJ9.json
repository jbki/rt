The movie has hugely entertaining characters that are all so over the top in the best way and even serve as a social commentary of the world today. I think the mystery element in the movie is solid but it certainly was not what I expected. There were certain things revealed in the movie that I felt could have been saved for further along in its run time but I still found myself entertained at every twist and turn. The performances are all great and I have a hard time picking a stand out because it really is a tremendous effort from a great ensemble. Overall, this movie is an original and fun take on the murder mystery genre that blends comedy and suspense almost seamlessly.","displayName":"Yash B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000592764041/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T17:59:09.960Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T17:59:09.960Z","user":{"userId":"915900746","realm":"RT","displayName":"Yash B","accountLink":"/user/id/915900746"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It will keep you thinking, guessing, and re-thinking the entire time.
