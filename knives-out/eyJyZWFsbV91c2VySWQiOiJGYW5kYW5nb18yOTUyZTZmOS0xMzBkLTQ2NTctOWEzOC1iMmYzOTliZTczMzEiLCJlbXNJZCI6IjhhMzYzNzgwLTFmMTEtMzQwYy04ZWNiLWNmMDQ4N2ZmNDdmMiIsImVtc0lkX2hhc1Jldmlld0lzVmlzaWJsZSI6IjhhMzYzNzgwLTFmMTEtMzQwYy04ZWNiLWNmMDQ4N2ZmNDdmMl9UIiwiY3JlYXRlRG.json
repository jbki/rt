Great plot. Great writing. Great lines. (I'm tempted to put one here, but I don't do spoilers.) Great cinematography. \n\nAna de Armas was fantastic - I can't emphasize that enough. Jamie Lee Curtis plays cold and tightly wound *exceptionally* well. Daniel Craig was very good. The whole cast was terrific; there's not a dud among them. \n\nGoing in, I thought this was primarily a comedy. Although it has some very funny scenes, it's not a comedy. I'd call it a drama/mystery. Run, don't walk, to Knives Out.","displayName":"K.J.
