The acting was good and the script funny.  I am not sure I would give it 97%.  The story line was a bit predictable although there were a few twists and turns to the plot.   I enjoyed the quirky character development.  In some ways it reminded me of an old Agatha Christie murder mystery.","displayName":"Elizabeth B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T11:51:31.540Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T11:51:31.540Z","user":{"userId":"35456bad-73ff-4ad8-94c1-9e5785394914","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Elizabeth B","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The acting was good.

I'm a boomer, and I think I was the target audience. Based on the reviews I was optimistic about this movie, but I didn't have super high expectations. I really liked it! Great plot, and likable characters. Even though I know how it ended, I will watch it again once its out of the theaters. I highly recommend it.","displayName":"Bill M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T11:45:40.127Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T11:45:40.127Z","user":{"userId":"b0f07b1e-c09e-47cf-80ef-e96948c15f41","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bill M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"}]}
