Every time I thought I had figured out who the murderer was another piece of the puzzle would be revealed and Id be second guessing myself. That said the aesthetic of the movie I loved too, it reminded me of sitting down with a blanket and a cup of hot chocolate to read a murder mystery. All in all Id definitely watch again.","displayName":"Ashley C.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T02:25:54.015Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T02:25:54.015Z","user":{"userId":"e80373ad-b4eb-40c1-88c5-16afe196cadd","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ashley C.","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A tremendous cast takes a quirky whodunit and totally embodies their characters with great timing, conviction and a wonderful dark humor.
