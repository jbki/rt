All-star cast, but the standouts are really the less-known actors. Has some good points of racism and class-ism worked into the script and plot in a seamless way. \nThe one thing I did not like is the overdone southern access by Daniel Craig. I know it was a choice (and they literally call it out in the movie) but I found it distracting.","displayName":"William W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T01:21:25.885Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T01:21:25.885Z","user":{"userId":"604209fb-50b7-4dca-8b3a-3c770506bc67","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"William W","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Ana de Armas really stole the show!","displayName":"Donna","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T01:18:00.098Z","updateDate":"2019-12-13T22:38:32.522Z","user":{"userId":"DF749E00-E36B-48C9-A446-EEE0F44F0B9F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Donna","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent cast/acting \nVery enjoyable","displayName":"Mary","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T01:16:54.517Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T01:16:54.517Z","user":{"userId":"784c94d6-981d-4ee4-8bba-8a713dbc2fbc","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mary","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"}]}
