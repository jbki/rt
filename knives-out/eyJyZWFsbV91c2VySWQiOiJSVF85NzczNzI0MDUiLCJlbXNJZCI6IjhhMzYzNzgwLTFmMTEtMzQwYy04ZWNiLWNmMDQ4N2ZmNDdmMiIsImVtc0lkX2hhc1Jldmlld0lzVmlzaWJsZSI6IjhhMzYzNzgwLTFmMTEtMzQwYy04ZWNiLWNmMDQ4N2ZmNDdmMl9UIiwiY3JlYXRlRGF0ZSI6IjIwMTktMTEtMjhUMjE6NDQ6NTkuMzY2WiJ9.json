The cinematography, the dialogue, the plot, the acting, the story telling as a whole. Probably going to go see this again before it’s out of theaters! I would recommend seeing this is a packed theater, it is so fun hearing people’s shocked reactions to each plot twist and as people figured out mysteries! The main character is instantly relatable, and it is so easy to become invested in the story because of her.","displayName":"jelletinny","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T21:29:44.916Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T21:29:44.916Z","user":{"userId":"3A4CA44A-54A7-4835-B21F-ADBCCB52545E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"jelletinny","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Really solid old school whodunit.
