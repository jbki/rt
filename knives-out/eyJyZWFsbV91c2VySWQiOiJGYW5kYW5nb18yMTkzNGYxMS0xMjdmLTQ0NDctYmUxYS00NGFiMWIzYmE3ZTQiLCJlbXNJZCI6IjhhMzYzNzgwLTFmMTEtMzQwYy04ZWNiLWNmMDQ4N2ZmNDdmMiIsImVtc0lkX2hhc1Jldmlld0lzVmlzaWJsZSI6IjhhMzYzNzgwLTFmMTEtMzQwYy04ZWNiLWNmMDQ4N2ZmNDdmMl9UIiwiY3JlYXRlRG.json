The script is an updated Agatha Christie style \"who done it\" with marvelous subtle humor throughout. Of course you have the huge mansion with big guard dogs, the maid, a nurse that \"cannot\" lie, the eerie music, plenty of knives and a greedy not so balanced family. Oh, and let's not forget the very dead patriarch. How did he die? Who killed him? Who was in on the death? And who will inherit the estate, if anyone?  \n\"As I see it\" Daniel Craig's comedic timing is perfect at every step along with his stuffed southern accent. Hysterical but subtle as the hired Private Detective that was paid unanimously to help the police solve this mystery. This cast is due for some big nods for ensemble, screenwriting and film. The theatre was sold out all day and it was a joy to finally see a film that had a plot without anything blowing up, no 20 minute karate scenes or AK's killing everyone.   \nEvery minute of screen time is pure joy in movie making.","displayName":"larrygene f","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T04:18:34.568Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T04:18:47.343Z","user":{"userId":"976602033","realm":"RT","displayName":"larrygene f","accountLink":"/user/id/976602033"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"this movie was really good. keeps you guessing the whole movie","displayName":"adam","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T04:18:06.719Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T04:18:06.719Z","user":{"userId":"AE9D760C-1F17-4758-85E1-C344DCAAFD91","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"adam","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great acting, fantastic plot, full of humor and whimsy.","displayName":"Amitiel","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T04:16:55.360Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T04:16:55.360Z","user":{"userId":"2f9fff04-5c90-4fe3-8519-a6e16610157b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Amitiel","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Light comedy, sweet film.
