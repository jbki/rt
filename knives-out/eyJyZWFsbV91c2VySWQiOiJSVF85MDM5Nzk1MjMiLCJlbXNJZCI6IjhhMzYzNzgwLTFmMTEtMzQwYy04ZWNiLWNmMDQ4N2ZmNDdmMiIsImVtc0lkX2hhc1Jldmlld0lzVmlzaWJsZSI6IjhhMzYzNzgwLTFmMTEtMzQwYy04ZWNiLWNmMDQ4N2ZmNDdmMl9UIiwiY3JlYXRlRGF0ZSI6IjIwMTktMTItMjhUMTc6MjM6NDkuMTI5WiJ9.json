If would have been better if they hadn’t given away so much at the beginning. I guessed who the “bad guy” was pretty quickly. Even murder she wrote had more clever plot twists that this movie. Overall, a fun movie to watch, but if you are an avid murder mystery fan, you might find this a little dull. Hence the 4 stars instead of 5.","displayName":"Jessica","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T17:19:36.961Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T17:19:36.961Z","user":{"userId":"5FD6ACCC-8FC9-4BF9-BB7F-1514C6294ACB","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jessica","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The film was perfect, just the right amount of who done it.
