Rian Johnson truly outdid himself with this film! I love how they give you all of the information right at the beginning. Throughout the whole film, they lead you to believe that you know the *whole* story, but as the movie edges closer and closer to the end there are just a *few* things that leave you a bit unsatisfied. And when the film enters into its last ten minutes, they just throw everything at you in a non-overwhelming way. But just as you think you *truly* know everything, they throw the final twist of the film at you. It is small but quite satisfying. I truly think Rian Johnson's spin on the classic murder mystery, is praiseworthy.","displayName":"Brendan H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-11T17:17:31.007Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T17:17:46.678Z","user":{"userId":"978427469","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brendan H","accountLink":"/user/id/978427469"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"You never knew what was next.","displayName":"DONNA N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-11T17:11:10.373Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T17:11:10.373Z","user":{"userId":"b8f551fa-8df0-407b-848c-0f550dff0381","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"DONNA N","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"LOVED it, kept our attention throughout the whole movie.
