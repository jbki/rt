I had friends and family telling me how excited they were to see the movie.  While I was not head over heels I was very interested mainly because of the trailers I had seen and the movie's top notch cast.  It is nice, once and a while to see a movie live up to its hype and \"Knives Out\" certainly does.  There is a lot to like about \"Knives Out\" in my opinion.  The obvious things such as the cast, as previously mentioned, and the production design are terrific.  In the cast the standouts for me are Daniel Craig and Chris Evans.  That does not mean the rest of the cast is bad, it's just that I think Craig and Evans are the best of the group.  Daniel Craig is just plain terrific and private investigator Benoit Blanc.  He steals just about every scene he is in.  His dialogue is well written and he comes across as a very believable character.  Chris Evans is equally as good as Hugh Ransom Drysdale the grandson of the murder victim.  He too has a commanding presence on the screen as Daniel Craig does.  What also made me enjoy the movie is ho well written it is.  The writers did an excellent job of keeping me guessing as to how things would end up which in turn kept my interest up until the end which is what I was hoping for.  \"Knives Out\" is one fo the better movies of 2019 and is well worth seeing in my opinion.","displayName":"Michael C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-13T13:20:31.242Z","updateDate":"2019-12-13T13:20:38.330Z","user":{"userId":"901197331","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael C","accountLink":"/user/id/901197331"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"A very entertaining mystery movie with lots of suspects.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-13T13:19:36.481Z","updateDate":"2019-12-13T13:19:36.481Z","user":{"userId":"976865156","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976865156"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The twists and turns were great.
