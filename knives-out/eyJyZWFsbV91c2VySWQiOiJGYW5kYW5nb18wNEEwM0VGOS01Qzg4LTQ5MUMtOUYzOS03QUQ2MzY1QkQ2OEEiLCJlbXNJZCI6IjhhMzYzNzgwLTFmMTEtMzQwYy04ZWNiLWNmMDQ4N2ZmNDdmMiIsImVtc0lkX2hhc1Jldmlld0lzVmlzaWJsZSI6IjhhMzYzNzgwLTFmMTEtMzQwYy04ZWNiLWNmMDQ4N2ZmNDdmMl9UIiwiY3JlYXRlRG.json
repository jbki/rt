I thought it was an amazing mystery film, a wonderful tribute to classic \"whodunit\" movies. The story was excellent, with so many twists and turns, you'll be questioning everything you think you know until the credits roll. The cast was phenomenal, even when they're being terrible people, making you simultaneously root for them and hope that they're the murderer. My favorite cast members were definitely Chris Evans and Daniel Craig. After having seen Chris Evans most recently as Captain America, it's hard to believe he could play a rich, spoiled brat, yet he pulls it off perfectly, becoming an asshole you love and hate all at once. As for Daniel Craig's character, it's hard to believe someone so British could play a southern gentleman detective as well as he did. I highly recommend that everyone go see this movie!","displayName":"Aditya R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-11-28T05:13:08.529Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T05:13:08.529Z","user":{"userId":"899fd22d-44ff-49f5-af26-ddba1c6e45f1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Aditya R","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great fresh take on who dun it film genre.
