He was found with his throat cut from ear to ear with a knife still in his hand. Every one is a suspect including his trusted confidant Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) that is the heroin in the movie. It's full of twists and turns and it keeps you guessing. It's a great movie with a great plot and with great actors who are all in their top form. I'll probably buy it when it gets released to the public.","displayName":"Glenn S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T02:59:23.954Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T02:59:23.954Z","user":{"userId":"99e0978d-5217-4896-a868-8407d2a6dea6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Glenn S","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A GREAT MOVIE\nSo refreshing to see a movie that isn't dependent on CG for everything.  \nKnives Out has a great cast and each actor plays their character perfectly.

The plot twists and turns and just when you think you got it...you don't.

Are thoughts not going through my mind- this was not filled with comical suspense though it was intended as a comedy/Thriller, I felt that this was a thrilling way to entertain audiences who are fans of this franchise.
