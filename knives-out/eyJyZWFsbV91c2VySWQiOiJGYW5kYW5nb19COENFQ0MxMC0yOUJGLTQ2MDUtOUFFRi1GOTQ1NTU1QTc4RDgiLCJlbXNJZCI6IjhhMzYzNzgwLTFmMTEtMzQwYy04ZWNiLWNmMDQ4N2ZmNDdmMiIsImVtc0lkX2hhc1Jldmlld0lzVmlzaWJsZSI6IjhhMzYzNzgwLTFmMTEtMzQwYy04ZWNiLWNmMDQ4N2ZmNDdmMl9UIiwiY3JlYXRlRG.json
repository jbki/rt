It does speak to how little good original movie fare there is out there today, though, that this film is so popular. In previous decades it would not stand out as much, but there is so little clever, competent adult content in theaters these days that this film that it seems more unique and muse-see than it otherwise would. The star-studded cast is fun to watch together on-screen, but other than Daniel Craig and Chris Evans, most of the other stars like Toni Collette, Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Shannon feel criminally underused.","displayName":"MellowDrama","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T15:14:35.021Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T15:14:35.021Z","user":{"userId":"3ec82677-fa05-4f9d-89db-e433168143d1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"MellowDrama","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What fun!
