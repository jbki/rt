The cast was fantastic, the characters were incredibly enjoyable, the story was engaging, and for the most part, something we haven't seen before, but the strongest aspect of the film, in my opinion, was definitely the chemistry between the Thrombey family.\n\nOverall I give it an\n8/10 - really strong film, would definitely recommend","displayName":"Mani P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T15:55:15.280Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T15:55:19.598Z","user":{"userId":"977719088","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mani P","accountLink":"/user/id/977719088"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"The ending was completely predictable.

After the mysterious death of grandfather Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), Detective Benoit Blank (Daniel Craig) is on the case to solve exactly what happened as he interacts with the highly dysfunctional and greedy Thrombey Family, unlocking their secrets as he investigates. With the star-studded cast each character manages to be quirkier than the next and though not every character gets their time to shine equally, they still take the spotlight when they have the opportunity. Aside from the characters' secrets, who give this movie its classic murder feel, the set design of the manor was just as mysterious and could have been explored more. However, though \"Knives Out\" attempts to play as a classic â€˜whodunit' it doesn't successfully use the strong elements it has to reach that point. The pieces are there, but the execution was not done well. The third act is where this movie runs into problems as it takes a long detour from the manor and the characters who we spent time getting to know. But, if you enjoy mysteries, \"Knives Out\" is worth the watch. It's entertaining, witty, and mysterious.","displayName":"Tanner G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T14:50:19.455Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T14:50:27.761Z","user":{"userId":"967508099","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tanner G","accountLink":"/user/id/967508099"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Amazing cast.
