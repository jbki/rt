It uses the murder- mystery genre in a rather self- reflexive manner. You have an obsessive ( almost mad) detective, a dysfunctional and exploitative rich family- each member with a motive. The storytelling style is redolent of hercule poirot, sherlock holmes mysteries and even has Marquez   and Roshomon elements. If not for the deliberately comic mentions of instagrams and the neo- nazis, one would think the film is set way back in the past, especially with the other anachronistic video cassette footages etc. This ambivalence of time, generic playfulness and yet the sharp political message of the film are a few things which make it extremely interesting.","displayName":"Ipsita S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-12T19:19:50.867Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T19:20:50.559Z","user":{"userId":"978428667","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ipsita S","accountLink":"/user/id/978428667"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Funny and unexpected","displayName":"Veronica Tingzon","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T19:14:02.669Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T19:14:02.669Z","user":{"userId":"BF66C0F7-5AC5-4B59-86F9-8EDBA9B682F9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Veronica Tingzon","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great story, great acting!","displayName":"Robert","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T19:05:02.641Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T19:05:02.641Z","user":{"userId":"0c9d56ab-d493-4ca7-b76f-6838dd3e85c9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Robert","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"}]}
