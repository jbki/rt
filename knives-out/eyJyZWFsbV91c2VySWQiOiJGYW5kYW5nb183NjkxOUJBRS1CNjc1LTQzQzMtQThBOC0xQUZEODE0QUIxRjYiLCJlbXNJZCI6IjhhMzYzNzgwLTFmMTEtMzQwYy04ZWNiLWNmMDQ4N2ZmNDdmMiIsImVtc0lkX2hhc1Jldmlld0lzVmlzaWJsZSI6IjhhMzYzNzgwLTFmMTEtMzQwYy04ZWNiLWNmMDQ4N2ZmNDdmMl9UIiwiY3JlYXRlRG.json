Lead actress Ana de Armas delivers a spectacular role as Marta Cabrera, the caretaker of family patriarch Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) who is found dead on the evening of his 85th birthday party. Also starring in the movie are Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Katherine Langford and Jaeden Lieberher. Though my favorite character has to be the one played by Toni Collette; Joni Thrombey who is \"a lifestyle guru and influencer\".  Well acted and well received all around.","displayName":"Vitali G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/26703111/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T03:06:58.957Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T03:07:02.739Z","user":{"userId":"782816517","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vitali G","accountLink":"/user/id/782816517"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great movie, well written and original.
