Not because it was terrible (I can't take the prequels over TLJ no matter what but I'll still take the OT pre dumb 2004 edits) but because his skill set is better suited for a film like this! The star ensemble, with some great new faces, are brilliant, the interesting twists and layers brought to the story are superb, and honestly, I could go on about this, but go see this film for yourselves. I think you'll enjoy it.","displayName":"Jon G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100003697195909/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T04:32:31.820Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T13:30:36.350Z","user":{"userId":"926084142","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jon G","accountLink":"/user/id/926084142"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Thoroughly entertaining","displayName":"Bashkim B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T04:32:02.802Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T04:32:02.802Z","user":{"userId":"ddfd5231-b8a4-42b2-8f7c-838c6cee8946","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bashkim B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Fantastic cast and brilliant dialogue.
