From start to finish you are wrapped in the mystery of this family and the history of what’s going on. Daniel Craig is phenomenal in this movie. Only gripe is is does take a while at times and feel slow, but that’s a nitpick.

Among the actors that were allowed more range was a southern-twanged Daniel Craig. Sounds bad, right? It is. The narrative could have revolved around him in a Clues-style whodunnit, but instead we follow the female protagonist around. Tedious. I mean she’s in every scene. The plot is clever. The movie looks good. The actors are solid. So why did it all feel so forced and lifeless? I’m not sure.","displayName":"Eric","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-17T22:27:27.568Z","updateDate":"2019-12-17T22:27:27.568Z","user":{"userId":"3CB5E04E-F8DB-4A67-869F-864F5558529C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Eric","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"So glad this was as good as it was considering the top list actors involved.

The movie setup was really well done. Superbly written and put together. The way everything unfolds so seamlessly is a testament to how well it was written.\n\nThis is a movie about being a good person vs being someone who is greedy or self centered. I was already in love with Ana de Armas ever since I saw her in War Dogs but seeing her in this movie made me fall even more in love. Michael Shannon was really good in it too. Probably my second favorite character in the movie. He always picks good parts. I kind of was hoping that Daniel Craig's character would have an English accent but, nevertheless they had to go with Kentucky fried. \n\nOverall, a great mystery-solving movie with a really good sense of humor and message. The message being that if your a good person with good intentions, then good things will happen to you especially when your not expecting them.","displayName":"Andy S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-17T21:46:54.189Z","updateDate":"2019-12-17T21:47:27.787Z","user":{"userId":"976200057","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andy S","accountLink":"/user/id/976200057"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2019"}]}
