He doesn't expect you to think about the odds of the circumstances, or the different way people would have acted if they actually knew what they later reveal they knew. Once the movie is over, if you're still thinking about what happened, that's enough for him it seems. For many movie goers that's plenty, but there's no depth, the story is laid bare for you with dialogue that tells exactly what he's trying to communicate. There is little art or nuance, it's all so evident what just happened. It's a movie I would never want to watch again or refer to. What's wrong with this movie is just the same trend as Looper and The Last Jedi, it's all entertainment for the moment, and dialogue with the message clear as day.  It's just a movie to pass the time, but it pretends to be grand, when it's just a fascade. I could imagine a movie like this in the hands of Christopher Nolan or David Fincher to be far deeper and less hokey. I've learned my lesson, no more Rian Johnson movies for me.","displayName":"John-Paul R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/577886156/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T04:43:35.904Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T04:43:44.591Z","user":{"userId":"628796386","realm":"RT","displayName":"John-Paul R","accountLink":"/user/id/628796386"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Great cast but not great character development.
