And Knives Out (2019) certainly delivered. I had a lot of excitement going into this movie based on the concept and I left very satisfied. The only reason this isn't gettting five stars is because of the length. There were a few times where the film felt like it was dragging and I was starting to get a little restless towards the end but the ending was extremely worth the whole two hours. \nThe topic of immigration was such a powerful theme throughout the film, and the knife imagery throughout was also very well-done. You can tell that a lot of detail was put into every single frame and I'm looking forward to rewatching it to see if I can find anymore hidden messages.","displayName":"Donald  P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T22:59:54.276Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T22:59:54.276Z","user":{"userId":"978411440","realm":"RT","displayName":"Donald  P","accountLink":"/user/id/978411440"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Fun and entertaining.","displayName":"Melissa B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T22:58:47.801Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T22:58:47.801Z","user":{"userId":"09A94D60-22CA-43E1-A10C-B8F166B7A3BC","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Melissa B","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"loved the twist and reveal!!","displayName":"maddmanj","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T22:57:49.934Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T22:57:49.934Z","user":{"userId":"118B9816-78CA-479F-AB4D-514B1099CA0E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"maddmanj","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Daniel Craig was entertaining.
