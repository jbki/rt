The use of melodrama keeps it light and amusing.  Daniel Craig's performance is especially satisfying in a huge departure from James Bond.

The premise is promising and the cast bodes amazingness. But from the naive interpretation of Ana de Armas and the first moment that Daniel Craig open his mouth with that ridiculous accent it is clear that the movie doesn't fill the expectations. Chistopher Plummer is amazing. The rest including the plot line underestimates the audience and makes one pity the talented cast forced to conclude the movie...I'd say it's harmless enough to be an ok first date movie.","displayName":"Noora  M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T13:15:29.407Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T13:16:08.855Z","user":{"userId":"978423440","realm":"RT","displayName":"Noora  M","accountLink":"/user/id/978423440"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"really enjoyed Daniel Craig as the lead...while it may have felt a bit long at times the story moved pretty well and tied up all loose ends.","displayName":"Bram","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T13:12:44.739Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T13:12:44.739Z","user":{"userId":"A69F9836-FF65-44E6-81BB-7C513AD5AE08","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bram","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Story line was fantastic","displayName":"Faye J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T13:11:34.387Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T13:11:34.387Z","user":{"userId":"2ee2f713-b022-4efe-98a7-e83537866cc2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Faye J","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome movie.
