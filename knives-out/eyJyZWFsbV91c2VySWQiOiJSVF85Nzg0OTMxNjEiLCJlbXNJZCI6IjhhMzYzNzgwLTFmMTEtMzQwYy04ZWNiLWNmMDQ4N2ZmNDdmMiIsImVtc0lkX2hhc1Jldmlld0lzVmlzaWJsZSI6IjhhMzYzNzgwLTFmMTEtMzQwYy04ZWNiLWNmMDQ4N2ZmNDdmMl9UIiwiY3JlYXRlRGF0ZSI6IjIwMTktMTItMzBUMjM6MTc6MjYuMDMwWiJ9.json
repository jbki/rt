I'm surprised by the high ratings. Although there were a few times in which I giggled, it was a boring and predictable plot. If were more scenes with the family (except for the apparent outcast) and the detectives, I would have enjoyed it because they were interesting and funny characters. The nurse was very boring.","displayName":"Melissa B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T22:19:58.001Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T22:20:03.742Z","user":{"userId":"978435874","realm":"RT","displayName":"Melissa B","accountLink":"/user/id/978435874"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was an awesome murder mystery.
