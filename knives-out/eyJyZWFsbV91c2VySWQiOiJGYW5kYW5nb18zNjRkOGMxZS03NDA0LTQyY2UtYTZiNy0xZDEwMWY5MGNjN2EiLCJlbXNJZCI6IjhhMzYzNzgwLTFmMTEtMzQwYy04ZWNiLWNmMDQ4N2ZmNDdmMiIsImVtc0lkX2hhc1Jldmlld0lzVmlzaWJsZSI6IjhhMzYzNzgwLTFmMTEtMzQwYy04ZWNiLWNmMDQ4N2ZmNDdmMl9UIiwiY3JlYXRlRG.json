Knives Out is really a classic story of it's kind set in modern day with Daniel Craig even playing a very clear Hercule Poirot type character.  There's a bit more humor and self-awareness than a lot of those classic stories, but never to the degree that it takes away from the twists and the mysteries.  And there are some good twists.  In fact one of the biggest mysteries is revealed midway through the movie which actually led me to check the time thinking \"damn, are we near the end already?\" but nope, they were just taking the movie on a left turn to Albuquerque that I did not anticipate and changed the course of the whole thing.  Johnson has constructed a great mystery in the spirit of the classics.  The fun of it too is how many twists there are without it ever feeling overdone.  In that way also you can predict a few twists, but not another, so have fun feeling smart and still feel surprised by the others.  It's just a classic fun film of its type.","displayName":"Michael M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-31T00:11:22.466Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T00:11:32.118Z","user":{"userId":"901376268","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael M","accountLink":"/user/id/901376268"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Cleverly written and superbly acted!
