As I walked into Knives Out, I expected a light movie, with laughs and a simple â€˜mystery' plot. The story starts slow, but when it gets going, there is no stopping it. The movie blew me away, and I rank it as the best mystery movie I have ever seen. Daniel Craig defies expectations with his riveting performance, and the rest of the cast does a superb job to keep up with the complex story. Knives Out is a splendid combination of excellent performances and one liners that you will remember for the rest of your life.","displayName":"Rodrigo F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T18:10:40.156Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T18:10:43.447Z","user":{"userId":"978386763","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rodrigo F","accountLink":"/user/id/978386763"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It is refreshing to see such a tight script, and an original story that still pays proper homage to the \"whodunnit\" movies I love (orient express, gosford park, etc). Hilarious and tragic, poignant and sharp, this is a movie you can enjoy for the surface plot, with plenty of room to peel back the layers of what Johnson might be trying to say about class systems and family we choose versus family we are stuck with if you feel like diving in that deep. Go see it more than once!!","displayName":"Emily C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T17:51:21.456Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T17:51:21.456Z","user":{"userId":"1f80d2ad-7973-4dcf-90ad-95a46f12a18b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Emily C","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie.
