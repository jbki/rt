Compelling characters and a great plot. I loved the way the initial interviews were shown. Showing a main character who can't lie is a fantastic twist on the genre. Ana DeArmas is terrific as Marta, always believable. Daniel Craig has the mannerisms of the sleuth down, and you can see the gears turning in his head as he analyzes all the information in front of him. (I just wish his Cajun accent had been a little more on point—though maybe it's just because I'm so used to seeing him as James Bond.) I really enjoyed the reveal of the crime: so often, murder mysteries have convoluted solutions, but this one was so breathtakingly simple I was hitting myself over the head wondering why I hadn't seen it myself—which, of course, is the hallmark of a great murder mystery. If you're a fan of Agatha Christie or any of the recent Sherlock shows, you'll find Knives Out to be captivating and delightful.","displayName":"Paul A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T14:47:18.475Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T14:47:18.475Z","user":{"userId":"355ec4ef-246e-4579-a31e-e430a3eb4af9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Paul A","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome movie, like the 2020 version of Clue","displayName":"Chris V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T14:42:25.435Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T14:42:31.795Z","user":{"userId":"964023008","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris V","accountLink":"/user/id/964023008"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Not nearly as funny as I had hoped.
