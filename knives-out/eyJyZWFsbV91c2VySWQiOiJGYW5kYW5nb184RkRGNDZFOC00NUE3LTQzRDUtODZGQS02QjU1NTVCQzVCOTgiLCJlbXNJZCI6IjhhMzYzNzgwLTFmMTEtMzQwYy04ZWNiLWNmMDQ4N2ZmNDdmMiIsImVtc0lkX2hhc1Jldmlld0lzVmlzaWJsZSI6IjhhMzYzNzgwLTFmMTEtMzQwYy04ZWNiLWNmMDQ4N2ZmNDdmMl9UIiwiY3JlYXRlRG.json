Every actor tries to out act the others with the exception of Ana De Armas who performs admirable. The dialogue is terrible and the twists can be seen a mile away. Rian Johnson, like with the last Jedi, believes heâ€™s being clever but In fact itâ€™s just self indulgent. Every twist is so clumsily set up and executed that when they are unveiled you feel embarrassed that someone thinks itâ€™s a twist. The plot is filled with gimmicks to keep you from falling down the gaping plot holes they are covering up! Thereâ€™s a lot being made of the political argument, the one thing I can defend in the movie, but itâ€™s there to drive the plot and set up one of the mini twists so I donâ€™t understand why itâ€™s polarizing.

Their actings add credit to the movie. BTW the music is amazing, too, pushing the story to go forward step by step.\nI love this film, especially the first time to see Daniel Craig in four years' time on the screen since the last 007. On one moment in this film, Daniel dresses in suits and tie. This shot reminded me of 007! You know Daniel Craig wearing such handsome suits on the screen is exactly James Bond alive!\nMiss you so much. Looking forward to James Bond in April, 2020.","displayName":"Weifeng H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/161119181926009/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T02:18:19.108Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T02:18:34.621Z","user":{"userId":"978415080","realm":"RT","displayName":"Weifeng H","accountLink":"/user/id/978415080"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was fun.
