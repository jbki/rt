It centers around wonderful performances and equally wonderful characters, but it's riddled with easter eggs and fine details that make it even more fun. And above all else, it does an excelent job of not taking itself too seriously. It is a very smart film; it knows it's a murder mystery, but remains artistic. It remains original while walking a well-trodden path. It's a very theme heavy, flick. While the themes themselves aren't very creative, they are portrayed very effectively; Its themes are apparent, but are communicated in artistic and un-obnoxious ways. In summation, while Knives Out wasn't a groundbreaking film, it was a fun, fresh, and artistic murder mystery. Oh, and that opening shot was absolutely masterful. I rate it a clean 70/100","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T01:32:10.888Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T01:38:25.858Z","user":{"userId":"260152979","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260152979"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Funny, plot turner, suspenseful thriller","displayName":"neal","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T01:31:39.431Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T01:31:39.431Z","user":{"userId":"885458FD-C03D-4545-A8FC-F5CE6C23BF41","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"neal","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Knives Out is a terrific movie. Funny, witty, intelligent, well written and directed, and the cast was stellar! One of the things I appreciated most about this film was the fact that there were so many side tangents that could have pulled the viewer's attention away to deflect from the main storyline, but they kept it nice and tight, and kept the focus on the relevant details. I would definitely recommend this one!","displayName":"Lisa B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T01:31:08.755Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T01:31:08.755Z","user":{"userId":"50170544-D553-4D8E-8865-3C08E25F7E4D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Lisa B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great mystery and family friendly for 12 and older.  no sex, limited language, and one violent scene.","displayName":"CHRISTOPHER","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-11-29T01:22:51.641Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T01:22:51.641Z","user":{"userId":"BDC9D6F6-FE74-47C2-A72C-1AE356E16000","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"CHRISTOPHER","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"as a fan of old school who dunnits...I was already excited to see this.  it delivered and then some!  see it!  what a great, fun and original movie.","displayName":"Ben","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T01:21:41.889Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T01:21:41.889Z","user":{"userId":"6D41AB26-ED7C-42A1-A3E0-262F1FD7810B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ben","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was amazing!!!
