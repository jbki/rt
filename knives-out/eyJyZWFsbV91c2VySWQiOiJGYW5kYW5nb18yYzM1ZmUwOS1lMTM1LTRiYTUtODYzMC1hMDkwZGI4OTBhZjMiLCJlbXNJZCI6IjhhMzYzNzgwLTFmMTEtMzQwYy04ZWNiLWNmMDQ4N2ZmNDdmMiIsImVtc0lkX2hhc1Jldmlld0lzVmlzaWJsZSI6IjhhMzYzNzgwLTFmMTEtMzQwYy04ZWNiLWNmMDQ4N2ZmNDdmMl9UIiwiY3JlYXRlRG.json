I felt asleep a few times because it is like a story telling and boring one. I really have trouble making sense of the twist. If she is a nurse after she is tricked a few seconds she should have realised that. The whole movie doesn't have any humanity values. It's controversial in many aspects, it's bad and unfathomable. Why would you kill your grandpa, why would you give all your assets to a stranger, why inheritance is wrong. The answers given by the movie were not great.
