Unexpected twists and turns!  Great characters and wonderful acting by all!  Loved how this had an \"old school\" vibe.  Being a big fan of the series \"Columbo\", this was great!  No complicated high tech factors were involved in this mystery.  Easy to follow along and a clear and clever understanding of how the solution evolved.  Truly well done!  An enjoyable evening out that would appeal to all ages!  Five stars!!!","displayName":"Maria B.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T14:43:36.623Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T14:43:36.623Z","user":{"userId":"9917309a-4ba9-4630-8b63-f8bded68361c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Maria B.","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Thoroughly enjoyable.

A well thought out plot with a spectacular cast and a talented director (thank you, Rian Johnson).  The enthusiasm for  the mystery 'whodunnit' genre is palatable in this film.  Dialogue is snappy and the film moves at a perfect pace.  I cannot wait to see it again.
