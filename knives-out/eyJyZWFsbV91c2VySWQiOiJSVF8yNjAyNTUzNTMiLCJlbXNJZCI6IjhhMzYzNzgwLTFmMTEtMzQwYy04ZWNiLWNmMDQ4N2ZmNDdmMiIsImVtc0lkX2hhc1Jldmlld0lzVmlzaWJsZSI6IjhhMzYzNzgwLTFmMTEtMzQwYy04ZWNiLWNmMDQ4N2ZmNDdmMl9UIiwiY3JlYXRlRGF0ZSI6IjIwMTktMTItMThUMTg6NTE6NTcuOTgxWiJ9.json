He has come out with a fascinatingly thrilling, fast-paced and nostalgic murder mystery. The cast is bloody brilliant and perform their roles perfectly in this stylistic fictional world that Johnson has created.\n \nEverything about this movie is beautiful. Not much can be said about other than it is the perfect genre movie. Absolutely excellent from all involved.","displayName":"Insta.

Knives Out is a wonderful piece of cinema and an enjoyable who-done-it ride that everyone should see - unless they are a young child of course. \n\nAll of the characters are interesting, and the film is well-written and directed. I thought I figured out what was going to happen in the film, but I was completely wrong. Rian found a film that he could rightfully subvert expectations on and it turned out wonderfully. \n\nRian has proved that his films are worth watching, but I still will not forgive him.\n\nMy Rating: A+","displayName":"Alex W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-18T16:56:08.551Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T17:04:51.106Z","user":{"userId":"978436708","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex W","accountLink":"/user/id/978436708"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"We loved this movie!
