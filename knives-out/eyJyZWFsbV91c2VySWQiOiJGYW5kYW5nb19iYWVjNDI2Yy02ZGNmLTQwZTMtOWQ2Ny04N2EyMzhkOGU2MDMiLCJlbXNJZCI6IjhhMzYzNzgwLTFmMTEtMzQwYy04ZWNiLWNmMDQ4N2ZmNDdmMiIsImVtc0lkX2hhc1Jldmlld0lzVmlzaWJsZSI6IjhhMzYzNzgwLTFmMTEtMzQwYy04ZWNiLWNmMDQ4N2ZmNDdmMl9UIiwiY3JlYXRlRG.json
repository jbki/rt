James Bond Daniel Craig's Poirot stand-in can sound like a caricature reading off a thesaurus, but once you get over that, he's a charmer and this frothy film is exhilarating and the most fun I've had at the cinema for quite a while. Johnson's genre script is convincing and well constructed. There isn't a genre troupe that it doesn't like and couldn't make use of in an elegant and clever way to play with audience expectations, while clues hide in plain sight to avoid any narrative cheating with last minute introductions. Captain VonTrapp Christopher Plummer's mystery novel writer is found dead in his big mansion house after a birthday party with his less than agreeable family who all have motives galore to wish him harm. The star-studded cast assembled includes Captain America, Laurie Strode, General Zod, James Crockett, and Muriel, amongst others, and they have a wonderful time chewing the scenery and playing against types. Leading us through all this is Ana de Armas's nurse, who has to bear the brunt of a slightly ludicrous plot device but manages to do so without tripping into gross-out comedy and unbelievability. Johnson's passion for the project is obvious and his directing is slick, stylish and confident, with an appropriately light touch that it needs to keep everything rolling merrily along while keeping the narrative streamlined and unhindered by contrivances and convolutions. Throw in a little subtle social commentary about class and immigrants and a perfect end-shot that sums everything up and you've got an entertaining film of pure unadulterated guilt-free fun that's not too taxing cerebrally but never insulting to its audience's intelligence.","displayName":"Alan W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T18:26:59.098Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T18:27:02.996Z","user":{"userId":"795081994","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alan W","accountLink":"/user/id/795081994"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I've found this movie very boring to the point of complete disinterest. The story itself is not captivating and the dialogues are written as if the writer was lazy. As for the acting, about half of the main actors played their part averagely well but the rest played as if they were complete amateurs at their profession.\nNot to mention the cheap shots in scene filming. It seems this movie was filmed and produced by a complete amateur.","displayName":"Daniel S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/847220690/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T18:20:46.518Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T18:20:48.150Z","user":{"userId":"886896796","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel S","accountLink":"/user/id/886896796"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Just a great fum movie...","displayName":"Gil","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T18:18:47.560Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T18:18:47.560Z","user":{"userId":"b8d8831d-ee8a-4224-b214-6faf33ff3b93","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Gil","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Rian Johnson's take on the classic whodunnit is a must see!","displayName":"Matthew B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T18:18:43.601Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T18:18:55.655Z","user":{"userId":"976140259","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew B","accountLink":"/user/id/976140259"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I loved the movie!
