Daniel Craig in particular is memorable as Detective Benoit Blanc and was riveting in every scene. Knives Out pays homage to the mystery thrillers of the past yet never feels old or out of date, it manages to invoke nostalgia without coming across as too campy which is commendable. Overall the movie is simply well written and even better acted which results in a fun time that I think few viewers will find much to complain about.","displayName":"John H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T01:36:37.128Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T01:36:41.931Z","user":{"userId":"978146423","realm":"RT","displayName":"John H","accountLink":"/user/id/978146423"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great cast in a thrilling murder mystery.
