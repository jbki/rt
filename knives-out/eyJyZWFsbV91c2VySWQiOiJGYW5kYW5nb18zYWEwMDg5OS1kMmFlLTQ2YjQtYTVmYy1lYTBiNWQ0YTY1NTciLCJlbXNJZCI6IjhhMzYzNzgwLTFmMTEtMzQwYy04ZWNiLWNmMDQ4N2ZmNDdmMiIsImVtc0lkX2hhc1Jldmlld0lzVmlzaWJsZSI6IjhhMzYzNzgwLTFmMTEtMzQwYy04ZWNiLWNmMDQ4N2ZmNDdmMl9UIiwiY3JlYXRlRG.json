NOT AT ALL! Christie's films are intricate with well-developed characters. This is shrill, two-dimensional, and 4–5 characters could easily be cut. A couple of characters almost don't exist.\n\nThere are many working parts, but the film feels as if it can't get more than one or two of them working at the same time.\n\nAna de Armas is engaging, sympathetic and likeable. The barf joke is tedious and cheap, and HUSTERS got to play it first.\n\nChrisopher Plummer is excellent, except WHY are his parts played i such rapid-fire succession, when there could have been a sense of discovery?\n\nThe bombastic music score is reminiscent of MURDER BY DEATH or FAMILY PLOT, but the movie doesn't rise as high as either.","displayName":"Steve C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/477061176037258/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T13:58:35.913Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T13:58:41.647Z","user":{"userId":"977459860","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steve C","accountLink":"/user/id/977459860"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I love all the actors in this movie.  I enjoyed the movie, thought it was well acted and done generally.  It was a bit too much of a formula Agatha Christie movie to get more than a 4 star.  I do highly recommend it, especially love that its refreshingly free of any message other than to do the right thing.  Simply pure entertainment.","displayName":"Vicki C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T13:58:00.836Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T13:58:00.836Z","user":{"userId":"8d050b1e-aed1-42ec-980a-66b8e0fb8654","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Vicki C","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I  thought it was a good movie, dry humor and plain old funny stuff!","displayName":"Gail T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T13:57:31.558Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T13:57:31.558Z","user":{"userId":"fa268cc7-2422-4ef0-add3-81f176d933d4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Gail T","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie was very good.
