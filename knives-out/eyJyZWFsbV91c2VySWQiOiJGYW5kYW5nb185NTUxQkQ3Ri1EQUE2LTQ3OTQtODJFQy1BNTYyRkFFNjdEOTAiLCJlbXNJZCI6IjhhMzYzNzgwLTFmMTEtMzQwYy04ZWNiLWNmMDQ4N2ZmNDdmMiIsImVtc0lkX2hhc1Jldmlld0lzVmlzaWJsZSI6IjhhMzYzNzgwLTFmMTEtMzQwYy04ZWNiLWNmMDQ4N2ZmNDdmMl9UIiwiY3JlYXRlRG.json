This one that attempts to mix mystery with comedy lands somewhere in the middle. Not a classic but entertaining enough to keep one's attention. \nThis plot feels like the Twilight Zone episode with the family and the masks. Christopher Plummer plays the grandfather who built an empire and his family are taking too much advantage in one way or another.  \nThe plot is a reasonable whodunnit but as I stated the comedy/mystery ratio isn't quite right. Just when you are engrossed in the puzzle something happens to make you laugh. \nThis movie does boast a formidable cast. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the eldest daughter, who by being the eldest feels she controls all and seemingly is the only one to have a genuine relationship with her father. Daniel Craig plays the detective with the ridiculous choice of a southern accent. I'm not sure if this was a nod to Hercule Poirot but the accent doesn't work and is rightfully mocked throughout the movie. His whole character to me feels out of place. \n I also enjoyed Toni Collette's portrayal of a woman who invented a ludicrous term for skin care. \nWhere this movie really succeeds is the family interaction. The moments that seemed the most realistic shined through. Curtis's breakdown over loss. Plummer's friendship with his caretaker. And of course the family arguments were the most juicy bits!","displayName":"Mark M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T17:38:19.775Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T17:38:19.775Z","user":{"userId":"1604cad0-15b5-40a3-b0a8-15b4b4b00471","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mark M","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the funniest movies I have seen.","displayName":"Annemarie E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T17:37:20.187Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T17:37:20.187Z","user":{"userId":"F4914F19-855D-4844-8F1E-33A77AED7181","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Annemarie E","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely hilarious!!
