It was tongue-in-cheek funny. However, I thought casting Daniel Craig - an English actor - was a mistake. He was supposed to play a relatively minor role but wound up as a central character. At times the movie reminded me of an Agatha Christie story. A lot of twists and turns but  the end was pretty easy to figure out.","displayName":"James K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:50:10.868Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:50:10.868Z","user":{"userId":"0a6a9850-a51e-4f51-a8bb-a1ae3135cf53","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"James K","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Absolutely fantastic movie except for the unnecessary profanity.

My mom even fell asleep watching it. It needed tighter editing to keep it moving along. The sets were great. I liked the acting overall but it was too slow and didn't need 2 hrs. and 11 minutes to tell the story. It might have been great at 1.5 hours long.","displayName":"Stephanie K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-27T15:44:42.683Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T15:44:42.683Z","user":{"userId":"25977f94-6a79-41eb-9ce5-1516e227e021","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Stephanie K","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I love mysteries and the cast and content of the movie was great.
