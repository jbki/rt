It refreshes the whodunit genre but actually functions in quite a backwards way for most of its runtime. I had a great time in the cinema though as it is expertly directed and the performances are superb. Daniel Craig is fantastic and its nice to see Ana De Armas really flourish. The conclusion did catch me by surprise but was somewhat underwhelming at the same time. My criticism are rather picky though and I did enjoy the film very much.","displayName":"Leonardo B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T16:20:59.779Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T16:21:02.825Z","user":{"userId":"978402823","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leonardo B","accountLink":"/user/id/978402823"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"More like a 3.5 but I rounded up.
