What a waste of Daniel Craig and maybe the worst and least necessary southern accent, ever. The plot was standard: a rich man dies suspiciously, leaving his entire money-sucking family out of the will. You may feel a sentimental regard for some\nOf the cast members: Christopher Plummer, Jamie Lee\nCurtis, Toni Collette, but their characters are badly written and you're not going to care about them at all. Good actors can't save a trash movie. If only Christopher Walken has been in there for a shining scene or two. If only. I slept through a good third of it but it was still only halfway done when I woke up. How this movie got such good reviews is beyond me. \"Ford vs Ferrari\" was a much more enthralling piece of film and this is coming from a person who loved mysteries and is bored by cars.","displayName":"Mary S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T02:18:40.505Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T02:18:47.580Z","user":{"userId":"976370875","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mary S","accountLink":"/user/id/976370875"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing!
