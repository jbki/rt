I felt the film had a relatively non-gory vibe to it when watching the trailers, so I felt comfortable taking my mom. Now this is important because she hates me for saying the word die around the house, so imagine her sitting through a 2 hour murder mystery. She absolutely LOVED the movie, just as much as I did, if not more! She even said that shell be watching it again in theaters with my dad!
