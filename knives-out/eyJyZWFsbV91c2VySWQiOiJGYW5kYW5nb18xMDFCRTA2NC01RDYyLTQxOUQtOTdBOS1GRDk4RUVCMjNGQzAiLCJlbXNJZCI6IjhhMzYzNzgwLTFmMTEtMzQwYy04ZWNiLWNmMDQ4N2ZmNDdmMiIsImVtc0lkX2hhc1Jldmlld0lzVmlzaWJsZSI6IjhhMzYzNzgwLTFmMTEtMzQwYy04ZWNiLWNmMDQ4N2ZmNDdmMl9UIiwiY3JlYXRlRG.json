I did like that there were moments in the movie you think you know where it's heading and yea it does look like a slam dunk assumption but guess again. Not amazing but was indeed a fun murder mystery.","displayName":"Ryan A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T03:16:53.842Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T03:16:58.426Z","user":{"userId":"952806669","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan A","accountLink":"/user/id/952806669"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"It's not a murder mystery, they blow it within 30 minutes. It's more or less a 2.5 hour Three Stooges episode with the culprit miserably dodging suspicion. Could Rian Johnson have been any lazier with his dialogue? If you're under the age of 14 you'll enjoy the character personalities, otherwise ditch this for Broadchurch on Netflix.","displayName":"Jackson M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/763785367/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T03:15:52.253Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T15:43:21.438Z","user":{"userId":"797719463","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jackson M","accountLink":"/user/id/797719463"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I enjoyed the movie I would see it again maybe one loophole in the movie","displayName":"Ty","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T03:11:43.838Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T03:11:43.838Z","user":{"userId":"8DA9F56C-29CA-4954-8FC9-61D4F740F8E8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ty","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"just saw a preview showing- phenomenal flick.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T03:09:07.739Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T03:09:07.739Z","user":{"userId":"260179565","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260179565"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"good story, well-acted","displayName":"irene h","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T03:07:28.521Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T03:07:28.521Z","user":{"userId":"31D5F868-674F-4AA7-8DC3-721251A74B93","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"irene h","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was very well done in all areas of the movie.","displayName":"kurt v","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T03:04:56.256Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T03:04:56.256Z","user":{"userId":"D9E037E0-14E2-480B-927C-5D49A1DB12F0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"kurt v","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"An mystery that thrills with laughs and twists at every corner!","displayName":"David","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T03:04:11.696Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T03:04:11.696Z","user":{"userId":"09FAA42A-1ABB-4517-B133-FB2EC689D444","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"David","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Hollywood has struck gold with yet another great film.
