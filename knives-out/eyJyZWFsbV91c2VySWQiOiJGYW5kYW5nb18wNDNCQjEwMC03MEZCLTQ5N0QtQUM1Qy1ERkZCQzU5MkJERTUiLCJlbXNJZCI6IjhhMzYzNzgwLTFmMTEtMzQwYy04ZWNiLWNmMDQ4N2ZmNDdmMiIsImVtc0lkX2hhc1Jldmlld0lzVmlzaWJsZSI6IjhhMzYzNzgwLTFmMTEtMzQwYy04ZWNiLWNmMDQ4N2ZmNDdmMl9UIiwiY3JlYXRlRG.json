The writing was sharp and the acting was what you would expect from this heavyweight cast.  Daniel Craig brought it and I'd bet on seeing Ana de Armas again soon too.  I debated between a 3.5* and a 4* and unfortunately this maybe more a case of having unfair expectations coming in based on the immense praise this was receiving before it was released. \n*2019 Theater #57\n*AMC A-List #83","displayName":"Steve H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/67502055/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T01:41:11.440Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T01:41:13.935Z","user":{"userId":"955604038","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steve H","accountLink":"/user/id/955604038"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"So much fun!
