Rian Johnson crafted this script with precision, and then he gave that precision all the flourish and detail it deserved on screen. It seems to serve as both a self-aware homage to the works of Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie's iconic detectives, while also managing to be a freshly nuanced retelling of a Clue story. It is modernized without being heavy-handed. AND OH LORD the performances! Every actor is giving it. If we could get a movie like this every November/December, that would be magnificent. Delightful.","displayName":"Megan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-17T14:07:49.566Z","updateDate":"2019-12-17T14:07:49.566Z","user":{"userId":"00fe29c0-2b33-4aec-ae66-a31bfe956513","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Megan","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"The plot was overly-convoluted and required a lengthy monologue by the main detective to explain it.  There wasn't much suspense.\n\nCasting was good and bad.  Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas were compelling.  Others didn't melt into their roles.  Every time I saw Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson on the screen, I thought of their real selves rather than the characters they played.  I thought of their hair, their posture, their previous roles, how they had aged.  \n\nThe setting was cool - very Agatha Christie.\n\nThe movie reminded me of the Airplane movies for some reason.","displayName":"Fun and Games","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-17T14:05:42.567Z","updateDate":"2019-12-17T14:05:42.567Z","user":{"userId":"74fedefc-678d-4334-ad50-7efb97dba8dd","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Fun and Games","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great cast with an interesting story line.
