It has a great cast and it is well acted. The story though was shallow and the only thing funny was Daniel Craig's accent. If you enjoy mysteries you could see though some of the twists from the start and won't be led by the obvious misdirection. Once again Rian Johnson can direct but he needs some serious help as a writer. Much better than the Last Jedi debacle in my opinion.","displayName":"Jim M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T21:14:02.728Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T21:14:07.757Z","user":{"userId":"977911529","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jim M","accountLink":"/user/id/977911529"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A genuinely funny movie.
