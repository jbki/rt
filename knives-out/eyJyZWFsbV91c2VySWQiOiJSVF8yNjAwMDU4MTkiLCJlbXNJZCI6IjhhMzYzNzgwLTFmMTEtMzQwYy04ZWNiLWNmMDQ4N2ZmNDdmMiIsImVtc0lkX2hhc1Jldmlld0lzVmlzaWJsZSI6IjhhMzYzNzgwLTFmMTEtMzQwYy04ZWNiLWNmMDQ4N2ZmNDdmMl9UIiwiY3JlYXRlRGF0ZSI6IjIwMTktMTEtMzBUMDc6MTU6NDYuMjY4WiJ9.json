With a lot of big name actors and an up and coming actor, the movie really pulled together. The plot and the rustic scene was really well made and the comedy put a good twist on things. I will say that the antagonist was a bit obvious. But I also like to pick movies apart as I watch them.","displayName":"matthew","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T07:00:33.503Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T07:00:33.503Z","user":{"userId":"65BB324A-747F-4669-ADB3-8345770DD3AF","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"matthew","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome murder mystery, great cast list!","displayName":"Jen G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T06:59:14.112Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T16:08:03.329Z","user":{"userId":"4515702E-C77F-42E1-B3AA-C41E1E386DB0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jen G","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"}]}
