Rian Johnson just does NOT know how to incorporate humor properly in his movies. there were genuinely awesome scenes completely ruined by a horrible joke to the point where I was just trying to ignore the attempted humor and try to enjoy the rest of the film. also some of these amazing actors are completely wasted clearly just so Johnson can have his \"gotcha\" moments and its a shame. this could've been one of the best of the year if Johnson just knew how to incorporate humor and not forget about characters mid script. its making me have slight PTSD of \"The Last Jedi\".","displayName":"Justin I","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/839723902/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T22:14:45.490Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T22:16:04.432Z","user":{"userId":"807800060","realm":"RT","displayName":"Justin I","accountLink":"/user/id/807800060"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Knives Out was fun with a twist.
