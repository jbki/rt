Felt more of a corny mystery tv show than movie. Was very hyped up to see it, and all of the great reviews, but the biggest mystery is why it's so appraised as a great movie. Wait till it comes out to rent.","displayName":"tyler W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T19:39:04.463Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T19:39:11.336Z","user":{"userId":"978432861","realm":"RT","displayName":"tyler W","accountLink":"/user/id/978432861"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is a must see.

The set design was boring, they could have done so much more with that house instead they just make an ugly knife display that looked like someone flattened the game of thrones chair and hung it on the wall. The \"plot twists\" we're not enough to keep me interested and it felt like they kept cutting back to the painting of their father like it was supposed to tell us something.. The only thing it told me was that the painter was probably also probably the set designer who made that shitty knife display. Costumes weren't even that great and the scene where they showed the Apple Watch is good to put the film in the 21st century but if that is the case why do they have such a shitty VHS security system? It felt like the director saw a Tarantino movie and tried to write their own version, only with shittier wallpaper and scene transitions that fall flat due to nauseating editing. I left early because it was just so bad.","displayName":"Natalie K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10202528717996540/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-15T19:26:14.771Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T19:26:35.008Z","user":{"userId":"978432847","realm":"RT","displayName":"Natalie K","accountLink":"/user/id/978432847"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"My favorite thing, a tiny detail perhaps, is that every time the family mentioned where the nurse assistant was from, it was a different country.
