I fell asleep. There was no back story or set up. I didnt know where the story was taking place. I would rather watch Columbo.\nDaniel Craig gave a great performance.

It's got it all: inept cops, a mysterious and clever sleuth, flouncy, spoiled characters, and twists and turns that keep you guessing right up until the very end.  Even when you think you know who the culprit is, you probably dont.  Its just fun.  And theres not one scene of gratuitous violence or gushing blood.","displayName":"LPA","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T05:29:16.350Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T05:29:16.350Z","user":{"userId":"873ceb1b-5d80-41cd-aebe-8969093d5b54","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"LPA","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Perfect movie to escape holiday family gatherings!
