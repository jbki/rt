It gives just a small hint at the beginning to keep us tuned in to every twist and turn. All of the actors are perfect in their roles and the plot unfolds at just the right pace. Daniel Craig is having such a good time in this role and carries us through the whole story. There are many funny moments and I was completely engrossed.","displayName":"Connie T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/952958208373900/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-09T16:43:28.642Z","updateDate":"2019-12-09T16:43:37.576Z","user":{"userId":"978285259","realm":"RT","displayName":"Connie T","accountLink":"/user/id/978285259"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Enjoyed some of the subtle wit in the dialog.
