It's kind of amusing and partly entertaining, but \"Knives Out\" simply can't cut it, even though it has a funny and surprising ending. Daniel Craig, with his fake American southerly accent is quite captivating, and most of the excellent cast bring across their talent, but the story is just a bit too slow. All in all, one can wait for it on cable TV and decide for oneself. 5/10 points.","displayName":"Giorgio G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-10T01:24:40.477Z","updateDate":"2019-12-10T01:24:50.175Z","user":{"userId":"975555794","realm":"RT","displayName":"Giorgio G","accountLink":"/user/id/975555794"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This cross between a Clue style whodunit and an Agatha Christie novel, keeps you in suspense with colorful characters that also has a very strong commentary about the state of Americas xenophobia and dusty assumptions about white supremacy and what they are entitled to.
