I don't know how something so poorly thought out isn't getting more scrutiny.  It's probably a 2 or 3 star movie but I have to try to balance out the madness.  This might be kind of spoilery, but you would know for CERTAIN, as a patient or a doctor, whether or not you got a dose that high.  It would be clear.","displayName":"Brian S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T23:24:15.028Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T23:24:15.028Z","user":{"userId":"978417601","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian S","accountLink":"/user/id/978417601"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"A pale copy of Agatha Christie's books (the big difference is that she had talent...)
