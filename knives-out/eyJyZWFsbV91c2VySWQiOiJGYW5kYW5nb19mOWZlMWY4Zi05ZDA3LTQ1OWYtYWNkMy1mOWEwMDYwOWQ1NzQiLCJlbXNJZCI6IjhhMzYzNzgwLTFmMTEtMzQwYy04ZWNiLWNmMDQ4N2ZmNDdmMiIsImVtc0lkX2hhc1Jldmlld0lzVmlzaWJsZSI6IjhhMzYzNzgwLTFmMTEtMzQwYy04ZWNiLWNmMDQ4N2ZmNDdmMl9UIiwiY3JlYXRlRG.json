The likable characters were lovable, the detestable characters were complex enough to be interesting, and no one was actually boring. The movie dragged a little at the beginning during character development, but soon picked up the pace and was a lot of fun. Very entertaining and worth seeing twice for all the references to other movies, books, and works of art. Fun in an irreverently reverential and referential way.","displayName":"Laura R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T18:30:46.193Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T18:30:46.193Z","user":{"userId":"136ad03f-3772-408c-b370-61cdcde4f19c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Laura R","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was a fun puzzle and I couldnt predict the ending which made it even better!
