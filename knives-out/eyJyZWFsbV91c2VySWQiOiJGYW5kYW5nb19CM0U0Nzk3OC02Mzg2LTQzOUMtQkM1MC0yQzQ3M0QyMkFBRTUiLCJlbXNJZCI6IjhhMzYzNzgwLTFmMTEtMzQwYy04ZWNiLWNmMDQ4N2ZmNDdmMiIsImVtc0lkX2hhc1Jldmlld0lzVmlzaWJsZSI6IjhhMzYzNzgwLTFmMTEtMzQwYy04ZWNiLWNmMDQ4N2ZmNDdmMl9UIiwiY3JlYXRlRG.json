This old-fashioned whodunnit isn't remarkably clever or witty, but it manages to present a variety of interesting characters/suspects in a way that feels familiar, yet keeps you guessing. I do wonder about rewatchability, though. Now the mystery has been unraveled, I doubt this movie would be as entertaining upon subsequent viewings.","displayName":"Joel H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10203681510265464/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-14T23:03:00.200Z","updateDate":"2019-12-14T23:03:02.387Z","user":{"userId":"838850011","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joel H","accountLink":"/user/id/838850011"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great family movie.

Her screen time at the start was so minimal that I found myself confused as to why the nurse was shocked when she found the body if she was the one who was responsible for his death to begin with. Their hair and coloring were so similar, you see.
