So much depth in the movie and it really shows the maturing and the development of such characters . It felt more relatable and more intense . The story line was through and lovely . I really enjoyed it . I will be going back to see it a third time ahaha . I am a Disney fanatic . Although I didn’t get what was up with Olaf , in this movie he didn’t really hit the points as much and his songs were a wreck . But it’s awesome , that kristoff finally got a song , it was just 100%. I was laughing the movie and it also got me down has it’s good turning points . Anna showed the most development and was most fun to watch . It was awesome to see a movie about Elsa finding her place and her true purpose , well also still being herself and not too drastically changing . I think it is a must see ! ANd the soundtrack is beautiful , especially the lullaby , the sound is just enchanting!","displayName":"Makenna","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T04:24:13.768Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T04:24:13.768Z","user":{"userId":"ADC3857C-002A-4499-ACE7-A1B408EB52AB","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Makenna","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"They really took into consideration the age of the people that watched the first movie and how old they would be now, was so much more mature and a great movie!!!
