There were some fabulous affects, a couple memorable lines.  The songs werent really as catchy as the first one, but I enjoyed them as they were being sung.  I love the message, but unfortunately not quite there somehow as to be ingrained.  \n\nThe plot was interesting, but maybe just a bit too much attempted, esp for a childrens show.  My granddaughter kept asking questions.  \n\nEnjoyable for the most part, and I still love the characters and Elsa.","displayName":"Marsha","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T13:57:23.925Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T13:57:23.925Z","user":{"userId":"77ee86aa-f895-4a85-a8f6-4cc463e0b81d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Marsha","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Olaf was an absolute joy as usual. My 5 year old and 8 year old granddaughter couldn't stop laughing. The central characters were as endearing and funny as well. I just wonder if the overall betrayal of their grandfather was understood by young viewers. That was a brave concept for Disney to broach.","displayName":"Michele","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T13:43:02.799Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T13:43:02.799Z","user":{"userId":"613b059d-3334-4307-ac0c-4ee508a0d236","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michele","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The plot was definitely much better than the first movie! Additionally, if you are an animation buff like me, you will thoroughly enjoy the film. Your kids however, will not be singing these songs every time you get in the car or all throughout the house. The music added character development rather than just joy. Overall, fantastic film and definitely worth seeing.","displayName":"mgilbert","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T13:39:56.946Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T13:39:56.946Z","user":{"userId":"36422c69-e3e1-4ddf-9be3-4c1aa4a2fe8b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"mgilbert","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"No where as good as the first.
