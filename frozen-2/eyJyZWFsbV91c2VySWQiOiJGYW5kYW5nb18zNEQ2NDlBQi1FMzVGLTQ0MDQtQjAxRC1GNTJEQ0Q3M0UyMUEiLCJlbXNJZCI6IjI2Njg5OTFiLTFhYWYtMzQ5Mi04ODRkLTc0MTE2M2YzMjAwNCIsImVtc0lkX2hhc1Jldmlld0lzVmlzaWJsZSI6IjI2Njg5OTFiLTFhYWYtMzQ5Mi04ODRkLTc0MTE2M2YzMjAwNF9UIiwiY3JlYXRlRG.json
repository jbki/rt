It had a lot the animation was better than first i will say it seemed like there was more detail and water looked so real. there were parts that were cute and sweet,some darker and sad ok i did tear up few times all epic. There was some comedy too just not like the first movie. our royal sisters have grown. songs are good pretty catchy and bit cheesy just like the first movie. I already have quite big collection of merchandise and i am waiting to hope get the rest of what have eye on for christmas. i do think this movie has left an opening for another sequel or a couple of short films and say same length featurette like olaf's frozen adventure. if there will be another sequel,i do hope we don't have to wait more than 3 years. 5 years was hard enough.i plan on owing this movie on dvd when that time comes. Fun fact: i dressed in anna's adventure outfit color pallate and i saw like 5 Elsa's and one anna. surprisingly not sold out but i think that the fact it was a school night and little kids have bedtimes. i am though so glad that just in case my stepmother had pre-purchased our tickets. showtime was 630pm but well previews some were good actually so 645pm when it actually started. the kids in theater i was in were actually quite well behaved. that is always nice when seeing a movie that adults and kids can enjoy.","displayName":"Tina N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100004671243569/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T07:31:22.228Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T07:31:48.684Z","user":{"userId":"939482085","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tina N","accountLink":"/user/id/939482085"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Clear money grab by Disney.
