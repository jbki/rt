I just feel like there were some parts of the 1st movie that the second movie could have explored a lot deeper, but I understand it would have been hard given the quest in the woods plot. All in all, it still was a very sweet movie, and hopefully some questions will be answered if there is ever a third movie, because I believe there rightfully should be a third movie. Spoiler alert: It makes me tear up a little imagining Elsa separated from her family, technically alone in the woods.","displayName":"Lexi M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T06:16:23.878Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T06:16:36.065Z","user":{"userId":"977821245","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lexi M","accountLink":"/user/id/977821245"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"not funny.  overdone plot.  no depth.","displayName":"Michael C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T06:13:51.663Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T23:22:33.677Z","user":{"userId":"FC057C29-55CF-4A8C-B653-36C10AB2F960","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael C","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My daughter loved it , the first part is much better because of the music and the drama , but I love the story of the second part .","displayName":"Facebook U","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T06:12:48.192Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T06:12:48.192Z","user":{"userId":"81D09028-4C36-4F67-8E63-730E4BF460DF","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Facebook U","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Another fantastic Frozen.

The adventure, the scenery, and the laughs make this movie a must see. There's also the sense that a picture you weren't aware was incomplete has, upon completion, become a masterpiece. So maybe Olaf shouldn't have been used to blatantly hit us over the head with the various (and suprisingly deep) themes, which could have spoken for themselves, but it is a movie for children (technically). Besides, at some point his role became a meta joke, and a single phrase will make you forgive all. \"Do you want to build a snowman?\"","displayName":"Lessley D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T06:04:36.664Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T06:04:42.924Z","user":{"userId":"977909967","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lessley D","accountLink":"/user/id/977909967"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Visually stunning.
