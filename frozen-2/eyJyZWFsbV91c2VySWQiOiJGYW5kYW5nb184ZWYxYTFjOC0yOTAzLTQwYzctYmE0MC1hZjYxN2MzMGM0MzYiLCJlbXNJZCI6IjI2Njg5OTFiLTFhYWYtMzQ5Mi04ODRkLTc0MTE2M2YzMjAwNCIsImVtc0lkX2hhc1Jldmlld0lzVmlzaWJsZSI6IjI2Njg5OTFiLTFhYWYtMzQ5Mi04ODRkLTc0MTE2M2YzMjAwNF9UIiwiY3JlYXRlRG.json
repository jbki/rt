Along with the stakes being high and suddenly dropped at the last second. Which is very unfortunate, and if you didn’t like the first movie, this won’t do anything for you. But if you do enjoy the first film, you will probably enjoy elements of this.","displayName":"Taylor W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T15:56:09.533Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T15:56:09.533Z","user":{"userId":"ED4CBC16-EA36-43AF-983F-93B91959C5DE","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Taylor W","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"VISUALLY BEAUTIFUL.

I loved Frozen I, but Frozen II was too modernized. Many of the scenes were weird and a couple of the songs made me cringe hard. Graphics are amazing though. Props to the art and design team. I just want the old Disney movies from even just four years ago. The Disney movies have really gone down hill since then.","displayName":"Google","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T15:37:20.173Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T15:37:20.173Z","user":{"userId":"1194659a-3c45-4b20-9088-8bad6dca78ad","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Google","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"}]}
