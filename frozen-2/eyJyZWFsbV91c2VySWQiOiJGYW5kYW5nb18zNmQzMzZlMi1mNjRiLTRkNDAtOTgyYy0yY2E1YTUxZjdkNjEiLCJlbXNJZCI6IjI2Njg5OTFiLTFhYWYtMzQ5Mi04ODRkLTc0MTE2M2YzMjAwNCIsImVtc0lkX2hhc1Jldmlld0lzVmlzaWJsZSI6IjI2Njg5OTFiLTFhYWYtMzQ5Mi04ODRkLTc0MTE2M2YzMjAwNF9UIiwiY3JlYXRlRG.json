I took a group of 9-10 year old boys. There was enough action to keep them entertained. The story line was complex enough to make it interesting and the graphics were outstanding. I probably wouldnt go see it again though (Unlike shrek or ice age). Music was good but again we arent uploading the soundtrack to this one like the first one.","displayName":"Juliane","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T17:35:04.970Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T17:35:04.970Z","user":{"userId":"9f573838-86a6-4b8d-ac5f-8fb9e40f14a9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Juliane","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"it was great!  loved it!
