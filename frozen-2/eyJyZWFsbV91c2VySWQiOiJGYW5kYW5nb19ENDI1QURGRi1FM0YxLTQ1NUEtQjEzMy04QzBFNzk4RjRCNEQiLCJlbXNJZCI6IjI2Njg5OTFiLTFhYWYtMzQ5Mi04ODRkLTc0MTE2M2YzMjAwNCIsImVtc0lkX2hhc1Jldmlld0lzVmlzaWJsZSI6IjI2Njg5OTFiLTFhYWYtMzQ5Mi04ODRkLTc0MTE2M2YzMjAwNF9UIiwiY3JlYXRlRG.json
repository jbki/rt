This story was interesting, but they broke into song a lot and the songs weren’t as memorable.

If you are watching it with kids, they will certainly love it; however, if you are an adult, while you will be entertained, you might find the story a little underwhelming. It does a good job of being a not-bad-but-not-nice-either sequel to a blockbuster first movie, so fans of the first movie would definitely enjoy seeing the characters on screen again. If you thought the first movie was just okay (not great, but okay), then you will definitely find this movie quite underwhelming.\nMy another gripe was with the horse. I am talking about the magical horse they had Elsa facing in the film's poster. Given the horse's prominence in the poster and the ominous look they gave it, I thought it would play an essential role to the plot. Turned out the horse was not central to the story at all (though it does have at least one part where it plays the Elsa's sidekick).","displayName":"Suman B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T04:21:18.867Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T04:21:22.269Z","user":{"userId":"978313659","realm":"RT","displayName":"Suman B","accountLink":"/user/id/978313659"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I was not happy that they were making a sequel.
