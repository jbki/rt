It was a very emotional movie taking viewers on a rollercoaster ride through tremendous highs and lows. Though fiction it happened to be one of the most relatable disney movies I have ever seen. Definitely a teachable moment for anyone but especially a children who have ever lost a loved one and is dealing or has dealt with grief. Another teachable moment for anyone who has felt lost and feels as though they have still not found their true calling or reached their true potential. The characters overcome such great obstacles in the movie, a true masterpiece, must see!","displayName":"Aaliyah","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T05:37:50.730Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T05:37:50.730Z","user":{"userId":"ba2fc713-b3fd-403d-a556-850a268bf826","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Aaliyah","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"A lot of plotholes, a lot of rushed story beats, a lot of mediocre songs, not a lot of character development.
