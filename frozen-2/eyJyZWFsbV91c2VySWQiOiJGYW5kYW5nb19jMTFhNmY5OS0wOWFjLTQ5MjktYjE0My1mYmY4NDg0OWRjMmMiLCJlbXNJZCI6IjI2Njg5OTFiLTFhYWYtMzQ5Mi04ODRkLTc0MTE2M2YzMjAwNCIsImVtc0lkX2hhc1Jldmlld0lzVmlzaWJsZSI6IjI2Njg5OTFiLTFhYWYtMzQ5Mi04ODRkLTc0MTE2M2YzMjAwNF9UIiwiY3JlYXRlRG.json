Oloof was BIG MVP in this movie. This movie felt super short though which is quite odd. While I love Frozen, we cannot deny that it does not have the same spark as the first one. I think it is impossible to even come close to how beautiful the first Frozen was. I do not have the urge to sing any of the songs in this movie yet, but I hope the songs grow on me eventually.","displayName":"Alex C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T10:01:37.922Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T10:01:42.452Z","user":{"userId":"977753380","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alex C","accountLink":"/user/id/977753380"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"So wonderful!
