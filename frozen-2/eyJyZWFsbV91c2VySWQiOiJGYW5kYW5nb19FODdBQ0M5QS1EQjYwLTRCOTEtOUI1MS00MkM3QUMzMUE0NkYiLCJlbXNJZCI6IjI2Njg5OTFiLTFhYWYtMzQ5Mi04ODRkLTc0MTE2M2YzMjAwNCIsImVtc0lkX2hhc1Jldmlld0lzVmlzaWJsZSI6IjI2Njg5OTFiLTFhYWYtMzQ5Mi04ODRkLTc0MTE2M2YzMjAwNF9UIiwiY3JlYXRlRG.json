The music plays out like a musical. I believe they won’t get any radio play because the songs aren’t pop driven. It gives the film a level of charm. Animation is crip and warm. A beauty to behold. The characters are more lovable then ever especially Olaf who didn’t come off as annoying as he did previously. In fact, he had many witty lines he delivered. The pacing was good. What I thought was lacking was an actual (‘present’) villain as well as sense of daring ‘into the unknown.’ Its as if this film was supposed to help understand our attitude towards change but ended up talking about their past more. The first installment was exciting because you have a heroine that was relatable and a sister that was relatable too. It was a constant struggle between who they should be and what they want to be. This installment shares the same sentiment but its not relatable because you realize that this was all predestined. Enough complaining on my part. A solid sequel. I liked it a lot.

Like a majority of sequels, Frozen II fell short. While the overall general plot was intriguing, the songs truly lacked the punch of the first film. In fact, all the songs are completely forgettable, with the exception of the North Wind Lullaby.
