I love Disney, I loved the very original Frozen, and love Frozen II! The music is captivating, as are the loveable characters we fell in love with when Frozen debuted in 2013. The core characters, Princess Anna (Kristen Bell), Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel), Olaf (Josh Gad), Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), Olaf and Sven are back and living seemingly normal, happy lives in Arendelle. Olaf ratchets up the comedy and has a plethora of entertaining lines and musical trips down memory lane.\n\nEveryone has grown-up a bit since we last saw the fine people of Arendelle. Kristoff can't get out of his own way in his desire to propose to Anna and life seems to be merry for all, until a calling is felt by Queen Elsa and the group goes in search of answers in the Enchanted Forest, a forbidden place. Along the way, we meet new characters including Mattias (Sterling K. Brown), Yelana (Martha Plimpton) and Honeymaren (Rachel Matthews). They all have a part as Anna and Elsa's quest to learn their family history begins and it gets a little dark as many ventures into the past can be.\n\nWhen it comes to music, I predict \"Into the Unknown\" is going to become this year's \"Let It Go.\" I'd be willing to predict the Golden Globe and the Academy Awards nomination for Best Original Song. I also predict Disney will sell millions of iguanas over the holidays. Disney's sequel to Frozen, has a built-in fan base, and the Disney marketing machine partnered with the world to ensure we know the film opens just before Thanksgiving, in plenty of time to entertain the entire family!\nI give this film 4.5 of 5 stars for its beautiful animation, music and comedy.  I would have loved more character development, especially for the new characters.  This film will appeal to ages 3 to 18.  There is one segment which may appear scary to younger children. \n\nReviewed by Kimbirly O., KIDS FIRST! Adult Reviewer.

Menzel, Bell, Groff, and Gadd sing with as much emotion and passion as if they were on stage. I recommend the film to all musical theatre fans, and parents looking for a good film to watch with their children. The best thing about Frozen 2, that people from all ages can appreciate is its stunning visual aspects, the lakes, and forests created are a treat to look at. The first film set a high bar in terms of music, and though no song could beat the iconic 'Let it go', Elsa's second big song 'Show your self' is beautiful, with mindblowing moments. Kristoff and Olaf's solos are very fun and catchy as well. Though not as catchy, the final song, sung by Anna remains powerful. I'm not a huge fan of Frozen but I gotta say I enjoyed it very much. If you are someone who liked the first film there is not a reason not to love this one.","displayName":"Kilan R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-06T22:49:45.165Z","updateDate":"2019-12-06T22:49:47.692Z","user":{"userId":"978421199","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kilan R","accountLink":"/user/id/978421199"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This was really well done, but some of the songs felt like the lyrics didn't flow too well.
