For most of the movie I was surprisingly bored, considering how much we had looked forward to seeing it as a family.  Maybe the problem is that there was too much hype surrounding it because of the first installment.  But for the past couple of days I have reflected on what was so disappointing about this one and my grand conclusion was...Anna.  Poor Anna, always bearing the brunt of the mistakes of her peers and superiors!  In the first Frozen she is a sassy, spunky, fearless warrior of sisterly love.  She endears us with her charming disregard of death and defies the laws of gravity and social norms alike.  \nFlash forward to Frozen 2 and she's, well, clingy and nagging.  She is obsessed with her sister's safety which, while understandable I suppose, left me feeling annoyed and bored.  Poor Kristoff is left singing 90's style ballads to a gathering of reindeer because her desperate need to \"protect\" her superhuman sister is apparently more important than her relationship with the poor guy, who also comes across as needy and a bit boring.  \nOnce Elsa thankfully shakes her sister and poor Olaf who has to continue listening to Anna's preachy nagging about feelings and how let down she feels by Elsa's independence, the movie actually starts to get good.  However, it's a bit late into the film and by then I was already kind of over it.  At the end Anna officially transforms into a her mother (who by the way says approximately zero words in the first movie) and has a boring hairstyle and clothing as she takes her place as queen.  \nSo yeah, you should see it if only to understand the context of what happened to the parents and what ends up happening with both of the sisters.","displayName":"ALYSSA W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T17:13:19.107Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T17:13:19.107Z","user":{"userId":"978422203","realm":"RT","displayName":"ALYSSA W","accountLink":"/user/id/978422203"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely love this film.

The answer is no, so maybe Frozen 2 feels like the studio pushed hard for another children’s box office blowout. But the fact of the matter is, the writers, director, composers, animators and the voice artists freaking KILLED it. Sure it was dark, kids need to feel these emotions. And anyone who “didn’t like the songs” is an idiot, the only reason you liked the songs before is a result of Demi Lovato singing Let It Go on the goddamn radio every 5 minutes. The music was amazing, I hope they find a way to put this on Broadway. And don’t even get me STARTED on the beautiful animation. Visually spectacular, a blessing for the eyes.
