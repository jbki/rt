Stories over the years are recycled and there isn't much new, so I was left watching what I already knew was going to happen. None of the songs are going to be a hit, there was really nothing remarkable except too much reliance on CGI instead of on great and original story telling. Okay, but nothing to write home about.","displayName":"Christine","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T00:43:10.086Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:43:10.086Z","user":{"userId":"B9A1E60D-7A4B-437D-A193-0446F8F34E9D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Christine","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I really enjoyed the storyline in this sequel.

This animation is easy on the eye, which may be a ploy is to help disney sell cute frozen merchandise of characters, such as Ana, Elsa, Olaf and new additions such as that of the stunningly animated spirits, the fire-spirit Bruni or the water-spirit Nokk, as well as countless others. \n\nAlthough not perfect, this journey into the unknown is a blast and has a satisfactory ending, Frozen 2 is to be recommended for all, not just the stereotype of young families.","displayName":"Joshua B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T23:23:09.254Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T00:16:37.472Z","user":{"userId":"978442037","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joshua B","accountLink":"/user/id/978442037"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"}]}
