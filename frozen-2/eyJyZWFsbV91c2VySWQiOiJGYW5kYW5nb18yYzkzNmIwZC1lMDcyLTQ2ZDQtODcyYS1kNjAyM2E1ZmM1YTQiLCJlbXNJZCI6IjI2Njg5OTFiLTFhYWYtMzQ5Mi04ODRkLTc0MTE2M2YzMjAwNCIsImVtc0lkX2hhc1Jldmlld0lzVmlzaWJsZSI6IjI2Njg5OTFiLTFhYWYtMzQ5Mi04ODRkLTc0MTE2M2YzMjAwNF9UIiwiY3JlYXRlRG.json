Also, we need to acknowledge that there were some beautiful shots and scenes that I did not expect to see in animation or even live-action movie. \nThe story was very well written the line delivery was beautifully done, the relationships and the growth of the characters were subtle but efficient, but I felt that some characters could have had a bigger part in the story itself. The soundtrack is very good, but some songs are not as catchier as others were in the first one.\nI liked that we've got to know a little bit more about their parents, which created a great opportunity for an emotional moment, and allowed the audience to create a bigger connection not only to the characters that we know and love but also to there parents.","displayName":"Aquiles A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1735161129915474/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T13:10:59.601Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T13:11:14.070Z","user":{"userId":"977379743","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aquiles A","accountLink":"/user/id/977379743"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It would have been surprising if it had been as good as the first movie, but it checked enough boxes. The animation though is hugely impressive, probably better than before. Olaf is given plenty of screen time for smiles. I didn't feel that any song will stand alone but they were ok and Kristoff is given his own number which was fun. Not really sure about the plot, although most of the audience won't care, no discernable baddie. Just seemed a thinner movie than I'd hoped for, but it has a lot to live up to.","displayName":"Lord Watertree","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T13:09:27.596Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T13:09:27.596Z","user":{"userId":"7235733c-7507-455b-81d4-8248a210a9ec","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Lord Watertree","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Disney always brings the best to the table and I've never been disappointed in the films Disney makes! I loved it, my kids loved it! Even my husband watched it and he's not an animation fan. I do wish Anna would have found out that she had a power too when she was born that per parents tried to have removed but the power wasn't able to be removed so the trolls could only erase it from her memory and during her sad solo moment she was able to discover her power and connect more with her sister....that would have been interesting.","displayName":"Jessica","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T13:06:03.356Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T13:06:03.356Z","user":{"userId":"f55a348f-71b4-4c8e-bd92-123f2b5b925a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jessica","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"So there was maybe one too many songs and a bit or two, not central to the story, that could have been cut.
