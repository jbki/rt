It just dragged on and on, making no sense at all.  Granted, these movies always have some type of \"magic\" in them but they went way off the deep end with this one, focusing on the \"spirits\" and powers and just didn't make any sense. A lot more singing then the last one and a very depressing song that was shocking they would even put that in there with the depression issues the youth deal with these days. Overall, this movie was way worse the first one, quite surprising they went this way, boring and stupid story line. The first one was cute even though a little weird but this one was totally lame. The whole \"me\" power theme with her \"finding her powers in herself\" is ridiculous and hearing voices and following spirits. A lot of dark magic stuff, worse then any of these movies I have seen and it was constant throughout the whole movie. Not worth wasting almost $30 in a theater for two people. If anything, wait till it gets out on video, you aren't missing anything.  Wish I wouldn't have even wasted my time to see this.","displayName":"Stephanie S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T21:05:28.213Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T21:05:33.790Z","user":{"userId":"978409935","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stephanie S","accountLink":"/user/id/978409935"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Confusing.
