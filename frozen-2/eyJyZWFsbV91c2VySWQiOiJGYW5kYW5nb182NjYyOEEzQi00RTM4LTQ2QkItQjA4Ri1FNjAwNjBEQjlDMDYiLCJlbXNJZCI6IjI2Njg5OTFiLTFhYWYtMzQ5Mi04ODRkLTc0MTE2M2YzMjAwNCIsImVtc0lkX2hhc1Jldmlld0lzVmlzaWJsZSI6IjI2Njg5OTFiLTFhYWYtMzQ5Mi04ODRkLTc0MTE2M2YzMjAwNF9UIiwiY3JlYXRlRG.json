It is likable and sporadically delightful yet narratively underwhelming. While the original movie is pretty great, my expectations for the sequel were oddly low. But I feel my issues are less about my expectations and more about my personal standards for any animated movie. At it's best, the way it explores Elsa & Anna's history was neat and its familar themes do have some credible weight; breezing by with some visually dazzling scenes, a few very good song-tunes (\"Show Yourself\" being the standout), and some affable Olaf moments (his story scene is aces!) but I was too bothered with how contrived, rushed, and undercooked the story was.","displayName":"Christopher D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1740545892/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T17:51:04.028Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T17:51:11.449Z","user":{"userId":"905573906","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christopher D","accountLink":"/user/id/905573906"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Seen it loved it.
