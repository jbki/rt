Kids will adore. Parents will get the songs in their heads. Disney wins again. They greatest part of the movie was Olaf, who, in Olaf fashion, steals the show with a crowd pleasing monologue. Elsa and Anna are off on another adventure, but this time, they go together. Anna fears losing the sister she just reconnected with, while Elsa clearly feels drawn to be something greater than she ever has been. It mostly works, and there are more than a few convenient moments along the way. \"Into the Unknown\" will be the song you blast on the way to work, or run on the treadmill, but \"The Next Right Thing\" is the song to teach your little ones about never giving up on life. The movie definitely lends itself to have a third, and God willing, final chapter. Hopefully that movie will have the same level of quality music, with a little bit more meaningful plot.","displayName":"Dan F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-11T05:31:03.098Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T05:31:09.996Z","user":{"userId":"978426940","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dan F","accountLink":"/user/id/978426940"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Seemed a little darker than the first, so we didnâ€™t like it as much.
