A big positive about this movie is how it is emotional and explores themes which you would not expect to be covered in this type of movie, a few characters pull some tear jerking moments out of the bag which you would not expect. The songs are fine, but there is no stand out song like in the first movie, the plot of the movie which is straightforward yet effective makes up for the songs. A big flaw for me in this movie though was the huge 30 minute exposition at the beginning of the movie which wasn't needed. It felt like the movie didn't have enough faith in it's viewers to explain what had happened since the first movie (not much) in a five minute song. Although these flaws, the movie is a entertaining, satisfying animated movie which will pull on your heartstrings.","displayName":"Thomas F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-17T16:26:23.249Z","updateDate":"2019-12-17T16:27:25.696Z","user":{"userId":"978435456","realm":"RT","displayName":"Thomas F","accountLink":"/user/id/978435456"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"So good love the movies so very much","displayName":"Zachary J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/429697714040195/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-17T16:23:36.249Z","updateDate":"2019-12-17T16:23:36.249Z","user":{"userId":"965870104","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zachary J","accountLink":"/user/id/965870104"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My young grandchild and the adults were mesmerized !
