Honestly too much singing, I know itâ€™s Disney but each character had a solo song and their are so many characters! My favorite part was Christoph and Olof, they were really lovable and not annoying. The best music was played at the end with the credits, Panic at the Disco! And Weezer, amazing band choices and great covers of 2 original songs from the film. There is a secret scene after the credits roll so stay till the lights come on!","displayName":"Gigi S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T02:28:39.798Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T02:28:39.798Z","user":{"userId":"38D5FEC0-1506-4A49-BDB3-B2E20764DF40","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Gigi S","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Ehh.
