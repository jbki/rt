The amount of joy and nostalgia I felt during this movie was everything. I was only 12 when Frozen came out and 6 years later, I see this and it was like all those bubbly, good memories came back.

Many touching moments that moved me so stirringly. Not just at the end. Which was so wonderful to feel. Especially in a secular film. Some of the songs were ethereal/melancholy. And the ethereal spirit singing was spooky. Lots of scary parts but they did a great job of helping lighten it with humor. That worked well. Wonderful!! Beautiful. Elsa was beautiful!! And true to eternal truths. God has a call for us. He will direct us.  We can walk into the dark and choose the harder right. (Thomas s.
