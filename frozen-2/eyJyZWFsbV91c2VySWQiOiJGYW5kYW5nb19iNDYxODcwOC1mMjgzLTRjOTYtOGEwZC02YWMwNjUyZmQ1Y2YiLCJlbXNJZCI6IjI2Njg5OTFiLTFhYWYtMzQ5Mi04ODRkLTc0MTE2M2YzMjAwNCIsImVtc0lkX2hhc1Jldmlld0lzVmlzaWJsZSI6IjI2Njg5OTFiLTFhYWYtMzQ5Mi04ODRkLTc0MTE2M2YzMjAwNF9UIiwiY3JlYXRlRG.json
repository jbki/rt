The plot is simple, understandable for a family movie, but without meaningful imagery. The most stunning here is the animation, you get that flow like water, it's feels very nice to watch the animation. The effects and the texture they put into the background also make the feels.","displayName":"Anh N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/590018105067955/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T12:37:51.707Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T12:38:01.916Z","user":{"userId":"978402093","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anh N","accountLink":"/user/id/978402093"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved Frozen 2.
