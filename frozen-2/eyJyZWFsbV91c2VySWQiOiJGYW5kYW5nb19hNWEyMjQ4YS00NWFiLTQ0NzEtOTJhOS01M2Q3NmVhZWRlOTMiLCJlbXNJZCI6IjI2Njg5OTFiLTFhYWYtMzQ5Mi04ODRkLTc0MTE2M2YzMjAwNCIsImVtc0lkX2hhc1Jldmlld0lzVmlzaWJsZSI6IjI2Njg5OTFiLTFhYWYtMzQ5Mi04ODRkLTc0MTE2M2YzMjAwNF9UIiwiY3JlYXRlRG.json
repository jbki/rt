For one thing, it is careful to ensure that all of the characters you might have liked from Frozen are back, regardless of whether they fit into the story this movie is telling. The songs are big, centerpiece moments but none of them are able to recapture the phenomenon that was ‘Let It Go', despite their best efforts. The visuals are gorgeous again, and if your kids love the first one then it's a pretty harmless way to pass 103 minutes; adults are likely to be much less impressed.\n\nClosest comparison: It's the best ‘2' from Disney Animation Studios, for whatever that's worth.\n\nSetting: Fantasy\nPlot: Adventure\nTone: Family","displayName":"Boneyard L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T15:01:15.182Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T15:01:15.182Z","user":{"userId":"977547201","realm":"RT","displayName":"Boneyard L","accountLink":"/user/id/977547201"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Definitely lived up to the original.
