In this movie Elsa questions her magical powers and how she came about her powers.  The story dives into the background of their parents and how they died at sea but the ship ended up in the northern parts of the Arctic.  The main characters are back in this one with a whole new slew of songs.  The movie was beautifully made with great animation but I couldn't stand the number of songs each character broke out into at each stressful event.  Overall it was a good movie and my son thought it was the best movie he had ever seen.","displayName":"Hrant B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1052501620/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T23:53:35.273Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T23:53:38.708Z","user":{"userId":"828564903","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hrant B","accountLink":"/user/id/828564903"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved how they developed the sisters characters.","displayName":"Benjamin L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T23:46:19.908Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T23:46:19.908Z","user":{"userId":"8F9D3248-7563-49BF-B049-C7CDA6FEB7A4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Benjamin L","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"This story should have an antagonist character","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T23:45:56.763Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T23:47:58.830Z","user":{"userId":"260140584","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260140584"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Movie deserve 2 star, songs are unable to connect audience nor story deserves praise. May be very young kids will like it because of name Forzen. Director should have included let it go song in the movie.
