It definitely was a lot and I mean a lot more musical, which got annoying pretty fast. The story felt long and dragged after a while. Besides that it was great to see these characters having grown and developed. Olaf lost its innocent charm to be replaced by some existential angst, which was unfortunate.","displayName":"stephanie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T09:36:22.643Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T09:36:22.643Z","user":{"userId":"3A5774BA-0CA9-4E4D-A01F-A17D503E3675","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"stephanie","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was good, but not as good as the 1st.","displayName":"Robbie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T08:21:50.733Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T08:21:50.733Z","user":{"userId":"AAFD1BF2-ECE2-424D-9882-632EA1F096F8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Robbie","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Although not as impressive as I expected it to be, Frozen 2 is still a great movie to watch.
