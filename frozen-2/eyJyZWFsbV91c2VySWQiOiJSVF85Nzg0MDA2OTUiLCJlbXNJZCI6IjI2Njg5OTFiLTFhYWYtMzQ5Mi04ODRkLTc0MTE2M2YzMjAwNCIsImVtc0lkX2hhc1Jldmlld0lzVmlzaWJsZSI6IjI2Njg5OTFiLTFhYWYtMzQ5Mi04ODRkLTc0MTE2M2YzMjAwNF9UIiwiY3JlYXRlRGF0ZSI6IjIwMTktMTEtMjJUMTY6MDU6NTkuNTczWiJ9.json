I loved the original for a wonderful score (a good soundtrack too) amazing animation and great message. While the score on this movie is more of a reprisal of its predecessor, the soundtrack on this film is far more powerful, the animation reaching new heights and beautiful nods to growing up, maturing and finding yourself. Has a lot of good laughs and not afraid to laugh at itself too. Wonderful sequel, I’m already planning to see it again.","displayName":"Sebastiani L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T15:56:22.219Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T15:56:22.219Z","user":{"userId":"A5869FEE-BAAA-415F-ABE2-30A5E6225A6C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sebastiani L","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"In a time, with constant sequel and remakes being released of former movies, Frozen is the latest in the trend to be released. Frozen 2 brings back the main cast from the first film which was released six years ago. Frozen was a huge hit financially and culturally with little kids everywhere. So, does Frozen 2 deliver the same way the first one did? Frozen 2 starts off with Anna and Elsa as little kids. Their parents are telling them a bedtime story of the enchanted forest and why it is blocked off from the rest of the world. The bedtime story is about two different cultures coming together so, both can benefit from nature. Yet a mysterious attacker arrives and breaks the deal causing the king of Arendelle to banish the forest in exile with the king's son (Anna and Elsa's dad) barley being saved by another mystery person. The story then picks up three years after the first frozen film. Elsa starts hearing a mysterious voice coming from the forest. The group has to then travel to find the voice and the truth of the past. The forest is protected by the four elements of the world: Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water. This is the point in the film where I started getting bored, Because I had just saw Spiderman have to battle elements in Spiderman: Far from Home. I was tired of films using the elements as the villains as they are portrayed in many ways. Ultimately the film falls flat for me. I never got invested into the story. Although the animation looks incredible with every song having a great visual scene. Yet, all the songs were forgettable, and none had the power that Let It Go had from the first film. The songs reminded me of songs from Mary Poppins Returns, Forgettable. It is just hard to even come close to the amazing songs sung in the first films of Mary Poppins and Frozen. With that Frozen 2 relies on nostalgia a couple times in the film with references back to the first film. The film even uses the story beat of a surprise ultimate villain, like Frozen had with Hans. What really work in the film was Olaf and the comedy Josh Gad gave to every scene. Olaf is well paired in the film by the fire element that steals every scene it's in without saying a word. Frozen 2 is about change and how it has to happen and there is nothing you can do to stop it. Although the film was funny with Olaf this film was not needed and is just made off the success of the first film. Sometimes studios need to learn to just let a film be singular and independent, but that being said Frozen 2 is going to probably make a billion dollars so I cannot blame them for making it. I give Frozen 2 2 out of 5 snowflakes (stars).","displayName":"Blair S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T15:55:36.343Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T15:55:39.976Z","user":{"userId":"978108605","realm":"RT","displayName":"Blair S","accountLink":"/user/id/978108605"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"The movies storyline was a bit too rushed, making it overall a let down but Olafs role redeemed the movie.

My husband and I wat he’s it together (we don’t have kids) and it was GREAT!! Olaf had the funniest lines and he made the “scary” parts, not scary. There was nothing in the movie that wasn’t kid friendly... and lots of laughter for adults as well. Cristoff’s solo brought me back to the 90’s and reminded me of Peter Cetera’s “Glory of Love” or Bryan Adams. It was a great movie!
