I'm not particularly into musicals but the music from the first movie was better.  Overall a very strong sequel.  It was really nice seeing flashbacks to when the girls were younger and seeing a little bit more of their parents.  It felt like the story was evenly balanced focusing on both sisters.  No \"questionable\" alternate lifestyle scenes thankfully.  Great movie for the kids. I am dropping it to 4 stars instead of 5 only because of one really long song (a la 80's rock ballad, trust me, you'll know it when you see it) that really deserved to stay be cut in editing.","displayName":"D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T16:48:29.096Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T16:48:29.096Z","user":{"userId":"0684d912-2fbc-4030-b109-11f9fe397d14","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"D","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was visually stunning, a great story of how each of us have something to contribute, with beautiful music.
