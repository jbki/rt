The first hour is great and interesting but all the side characters are not well put as most of them are underused. Not only that but the ending is bad, and they were not as funny in this film in comparison to the first. But the songs in the film are good and none of them were really bad and there was no moment that did make me feel whimsical, 6/10","displayName":"lucas r","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T04:32:02.414Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T04:38:49.385Z","user":{"userId":"978407666","realm":"RT","displayName":"lucas r","accountLink":"/user/id/978407666"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved it personally but think it may have been a little deep for our almost 4 year old.
