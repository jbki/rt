Great story line. Things that makes everyone laugh, things only kids find funny and a fun scene for the adults to enjoy. All the songs were wonderful. The Next Right Thing is emotional and powerful, it made me tear up. The nature/spirit/elemental themes remind me of Avatar The Last Airbender which was awesome! Loved watching this sister-bond focused movie with my sister as we watched the first one together in theaters as well","displayName":"Mg Reyes","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T05:26:46.493Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T05:26:46.493Z","user":{"userId":"b7baa4e3-f44c-4d13-af43-99ca7ea652a6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mg Reyes","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I liked everything of the movie.","displayName":"Eve.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T05:25:27.936Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T05:25:27.936Z","user":{"userId":"C2271B96-5948-4EB9-8529-E4F27DBC31A6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Eve.","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very nice movie love it .","displayName":"Sonia","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T05:24:54.625Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T05:26:30.219Z","user":{"userId":"0bc6c268-a390-4986-ab11-58fcf0525a87","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sonia","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was my second time seeing the film, and even though I knew what was going to happen, seeing it in IMAX with a good sound system made the movie more emotionally stirring. A second viewing is required since there are moments when the laughter drowns out the dialogue.
