I have a 4 year old who suggests we call her Elsa while wearing her Halloween costume. So, it's safe to say Frozen-anything is a hot topic in this household. \n\nThe first film left me in tears, feeling so refreshed that the true hero of the movie wasn't a man that gave someone a kiss, but the bond and love of sisters. So, I wondered where could they go with Frozen 2. \n\nIt definitely took turns I wasn't expecting, but I love the story and how we learn about the origin of Elsa's powers. Additionally, we saw Elsa change in the first one, and quite another transformation in the second one. What was really great was seeing how Anna grew too. \n\nThe movie garnered gasps, tears, laughs (Olaf's summation of the first movie left me in fits of giggles) and a variety of emotions. \n\nI do warn though that some scenes are a bit intense. My 4 year old cried during some of moments when the characters were in mortal peril, she was very worried about them. The rock giants were a bit frightening for her as well. She of course calmed down and enjoyed the film, but a heads up in case you need to hold their hand or give them a side hug during those scenes.","displayName":"Jennifer M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1044595424/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T13:43:44.518Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T13:43:59.511Z","user":{"userId":"837273363","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jennifer M","accountLink":"/user/id/837273363"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was hilarious and heart warming!","displayName":"Heather","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T13:41:09.142Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T13:41:09.142Z","user":{"userId":"78030f8a-23ea-44cc-ab9a-bd1931bc468c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Heather","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved the singing and how they had a strong message, to go forward in life, you must make things right, when you have wrong someone.

This is a childs movie, so if you didnt enjoy it, suck it up buttercup!  Some people brought children under three to the show I went to. They were constantly in and out of the theater, however you could hear the laughter of children at the funny parts, sighs at the sad parts and clapping at the end. I am a grandmother who brought her 8 year old grandson, we had an amazing time with watching this.","displayName":"Medina","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T13:37:56.292Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T13:44:13.148Z","user":{"userId":"f2d5c5b2-224d-4fba-8a2c-7d4727e00183","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Medina","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"The movie appeared to be a stage musical in an animated movie.  There were several scenes that focused on characters performing solos of the musical scores.  I don’t believe it is a sequel as much as a new stand alone feature.
