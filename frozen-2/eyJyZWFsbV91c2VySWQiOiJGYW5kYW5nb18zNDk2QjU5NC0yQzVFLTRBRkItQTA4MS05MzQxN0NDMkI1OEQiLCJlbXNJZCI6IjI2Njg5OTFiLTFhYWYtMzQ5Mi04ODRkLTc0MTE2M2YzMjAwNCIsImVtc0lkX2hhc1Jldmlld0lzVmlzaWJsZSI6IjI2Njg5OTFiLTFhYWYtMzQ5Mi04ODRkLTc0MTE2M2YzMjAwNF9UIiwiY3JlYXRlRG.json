The film was directed by Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, and stars Idina Menzel as Elsa and Kristen Bell as Anna.\n\nAn at times beautifully animated film that sadly suffers from a lacklustre story with one of the most infuriating endings that I've seen in an animated Disney film as of this time. The voice cast was strong, the characters were uninteresting and at times just dated caricatures, the animation was, for the most part, stunning, but unfortunately, the story really let down the film and made it nearly unbearable to sit through.\n\nOverall I give it a \n3/10 - not good, wouldn't recommend","displayName":"Mani P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T22:01:53.873Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T22:01:58.415Z","user":{"userId":"977719088","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mani P","accountLink":"/user/id/977719088"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"}]}
