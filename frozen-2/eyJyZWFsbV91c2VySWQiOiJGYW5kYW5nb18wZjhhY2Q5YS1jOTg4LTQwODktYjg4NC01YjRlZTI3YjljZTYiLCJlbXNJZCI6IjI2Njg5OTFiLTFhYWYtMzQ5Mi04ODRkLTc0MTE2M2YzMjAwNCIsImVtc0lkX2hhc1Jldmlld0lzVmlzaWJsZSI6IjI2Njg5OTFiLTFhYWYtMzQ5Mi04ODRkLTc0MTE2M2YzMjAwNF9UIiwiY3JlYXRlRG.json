Clearly, no cost-cutting here! It''s a treat to watch.\n\nThe music and lyrics are good, but lack the immediate impact and outright passion of Frozen. The story is also less cohesive and darker than the original. More characters are introduced, but they seemingly don't have enough to do.\n\nHaving said that, Frozen 2 is a very enjoyable film for both children and adults. The singing talents of the cast are wonderful, and Olaf (Josh Gad) gets some great lines.","displayName":"Steven K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-10T15:28:57.822Z","updateDate":"2019-12-10T15:28:57.822Z","user":{"userId":"bf9a9676-d2f8-471d-b42d-8c012843f785","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Steven K","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I didnâ€™t like any of the new songs ðŸ˜© but the story line was perfect","displayName":"Jasmine","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-10T15:10:18.946Z","updateDate":"2019-12-10T15:10:18.946Z","user":{"userId":"387FCBF7-026F-44CB-A763-BF74256BDBD7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jasmine","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Very enjoyable.
