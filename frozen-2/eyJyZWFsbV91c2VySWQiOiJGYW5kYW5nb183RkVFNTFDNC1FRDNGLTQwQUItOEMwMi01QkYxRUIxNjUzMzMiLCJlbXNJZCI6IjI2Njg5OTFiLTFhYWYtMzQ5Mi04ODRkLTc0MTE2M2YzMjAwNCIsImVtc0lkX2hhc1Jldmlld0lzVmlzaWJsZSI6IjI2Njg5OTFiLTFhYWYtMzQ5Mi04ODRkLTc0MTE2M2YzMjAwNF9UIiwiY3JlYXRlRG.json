The story is jumbled, some characters are pushed to the side unjustly, and the humor wasn't entirely to my taste. However, I can't deny that I still had a fun time with this. \"Into the Unknown\" is undeniably powerful, but be warned: your kids or younger siblings will probably try to hit one of the high notes and hilariously fail.","displayName":"Taylor R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T05:05:56.772Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T21:28:49.228Z","user":{"userId":"978383422","realm":"RT","displayName":"Taylor R","accountLink":"/user/id/978383422"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Good, but not as much as the 1st one.","displayName":"Chris M.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T05:02:53.914Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T05:02:53.914Z","user":{"userId":"1EF78762-3459-4DAD-BE0D-32878E243153","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chris M.","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"}]}
