I'm so happy Disney delivered on this one. This will easily be one of the most classic Disney films of all time. The magic, the adventure, the love, the comedy all of it was there and quality. The music in my opinion was outstanding and I was honestly swept away by it. There were just a ton of very memorable moments and the kids loved it. My ONLY complaint was that I wish there was a little more explanation about Elsa's \"revelation\" moment but maybe in the next one they'll do that. The two sisters were powerful female leaders of a city but they were still very feminine. Basically showing girls don't have to act or look masculine or even be physically dominant to lead. They can do it with their hearts and minds. A lot of female leadership that we look to right now are just men in female bodies and I don't see actual feminine traits like gentleness and vulnerability in leaders yet. I would love to see those qualities be welcomed into leadership to balance the masculine and this movie gives a window into that.","displayName":"Sean S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T05:23:39.656Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T05:23:39.656Z","user":{"userId":"978403387","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sean S","accountLink":"/user/id/978403387"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"It was okay.... story was much predictable, complicated, lots and lots of singing (which was not as catchy!) and geared more for older kids/adults.

It can't quite top the first but it gets close. The animation and acting is top notch. I don't think anybody expects any less in that regard. The most of the film the story is great and doesn't slow down once it gets going. The first two acts are incredible and beat the original film for me. The third act is where this movie stumbles. The climax feels a bit to quick with some strange character choices. It's almost as if they cut a small chunk out of the film. It doesn't ruin the movie but it does leave you not being fully satisfied. The songs are as great as ever and will be stuck in your head for months. Even with the third act being a bit off, Frozen 2 delivers a great sequel that will leave fans pleased.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T05:22:16.522Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T05:22:16.522Z","user":{"userId":"969511796","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/969511796"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Don't listen to the critics, it's fun, and my kids love it.","displayName":"Ryan L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001369429716/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T05:20:34.904Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T05:20:40.031Z","user":{"userId":"950862884","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan L","accountLink":"/user/id/950862884"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"May be an unpopular opinion but I thought this was even better than the original.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T05:19:07.616Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T05:19:07.616Z","user":{"userId":"917459422","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/917459422"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"}]}
