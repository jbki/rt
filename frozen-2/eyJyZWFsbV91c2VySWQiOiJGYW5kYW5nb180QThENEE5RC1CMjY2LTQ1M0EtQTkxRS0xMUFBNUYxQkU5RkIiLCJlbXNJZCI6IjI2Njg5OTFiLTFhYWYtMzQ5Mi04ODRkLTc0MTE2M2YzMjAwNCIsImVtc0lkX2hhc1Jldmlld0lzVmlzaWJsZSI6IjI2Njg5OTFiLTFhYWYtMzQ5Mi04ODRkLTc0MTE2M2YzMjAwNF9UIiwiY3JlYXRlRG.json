For example in the move the water dam was an action of betrayal disgusted as a gift and it was later discovered why their was a such a big deal about it. I would recommend this movie.

It blows the original out of the water. The scope of the world, the character development, the storytelling, the themes and metaphors, and even the allusions to America's past are so impressively woven together that this movie feels more on par with the Disney Renaissance films than Frozen 1 ever could. It's both timeless and painfully applicable to all the millennial parents inevitably in the audience. And yes, though there aren't any songs that may become radio ear-worms, the music is still top-notch quality, and has the more broadway musical theater magic of the older films. I absolutely believe Frozen 2 is one of the best Disney movies in a decade. Frozen 1?
