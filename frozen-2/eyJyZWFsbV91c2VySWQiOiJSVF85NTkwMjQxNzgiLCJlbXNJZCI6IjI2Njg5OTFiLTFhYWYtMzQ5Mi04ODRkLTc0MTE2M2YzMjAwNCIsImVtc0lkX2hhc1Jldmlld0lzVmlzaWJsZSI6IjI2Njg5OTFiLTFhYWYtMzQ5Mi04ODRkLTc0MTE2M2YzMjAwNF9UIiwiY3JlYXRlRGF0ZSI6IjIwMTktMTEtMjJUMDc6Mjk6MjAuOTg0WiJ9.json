It included quite a lot of adult humor and was extremely relatable, even for an older audience. It also included a lot of Scandinavian traditions and folklore,which was very for me as someone with a Norwegian background. I'm so glad they showcased the beauty of culning and included a really strong female bond between two sisters (that didn't completely exclude important and lovable male characters, like other recent releases). Overall, a wonderful movie for people of all ages!","displayName":"wine woman","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T07:27:43.346Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T07:27:43.346Z","user":{"userId":"a4e426e8-93c4-46e2-8179-9faad3e81b9c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"wine woman","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"songs are too cheesy","displayName":"jenny b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T07:27:38.894Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T07:27:38.894Z","user":{"userId":"9FEE3FCA-B8B4-4DD6-8D13-1057907D3BF1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"jenny b","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Such an amazing and stunning movie.
