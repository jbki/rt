The story telling on display is top notch, being engaging and well paced. It bounces between being mystic and epic to goofy with no real turbulence. Some of the song sections didn't do much for me, and there were no break out \"Let It Go's\", but they were solid. The 80's esque music video had me quite amused. Olaf stole the comedic part of the show with his existential crises jokes. There's a lot packed in here: finding your purpose, not wanting to mess up a good thing but discovering that change is inevitable, righting the wrongs of your ancestors, and diplomacy. Definitely got some Last Airbender vibes too, though some of it didn't quite make sense to me. And it's absolutely beautiful, with some infrequent uncanny valleys on some character expressions. I had a smile on my face most of the time and rarely felt my attention waver. I'd say this is better than the original.","displayName":"Cameron T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T23:56:38.198Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T23:56:41.937Z","user":{"userId":"976223157","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cameron T","accountLink":"/user/id/976223157"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"‚Ä™I think I have my final thoughts on Frozen 2.
