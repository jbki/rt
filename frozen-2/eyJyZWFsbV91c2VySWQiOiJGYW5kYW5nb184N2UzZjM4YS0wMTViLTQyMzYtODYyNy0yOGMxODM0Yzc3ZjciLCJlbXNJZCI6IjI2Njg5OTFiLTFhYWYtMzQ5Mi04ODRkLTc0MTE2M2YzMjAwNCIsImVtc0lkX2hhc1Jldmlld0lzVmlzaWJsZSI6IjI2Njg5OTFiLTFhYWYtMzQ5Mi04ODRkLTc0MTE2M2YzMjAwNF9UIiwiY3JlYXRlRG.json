However they provided a nice recover somewhat. Some parts were a little slow and felt a little uneeded however does make sense in the end. For the parents do not have to worry about your kids singing Let it Go, there are plenty of great songs in the movie.","displayName":"Corey C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T04:26:46.856Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T04:26:54.322Z","user":{"userId":"856FC436-7F11-473B-AAF2-E935FDBE4B8F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Corey C","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A must see for the family.","displayName":"miriam","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T04:26:44.457Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T04:26:44.457Z","user":{"userId":"0A32EE43-BEF3-46AF-9953-A5382C1F845F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"miriam","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Phenomenal and magical.","displayName":"Cole N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100004254545432/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T04:25:57.733Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T04:25:57.733Z","user":{"userId":"961687221","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cole N","accountLink":"/user/id/961687221"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I LOVED this movie. it was so catchy, loving, and inspiring. It truly shows how women can be the center of a story and save the day without needing the help of a man. It also shows the importance of family bonds and how the love between family members is stronger than any other type of love. The songs in this movie were so beautiful and instantly got stuck in my head after the movie was over. This movie was so good i saw it again the next day. All of the characters flowed perfectly with their roles and i loved that olaf received more screen time along with kristoff. Their solo songs were so sweet and funny. I liked that kristoffe character was love struck the whole movie and didnt try to stop anna from becoming who she truly is. She knew what she had to do for her sister and for her city and did it on her own. In the scene where she is being chased by the earth spirit and is about to die and kristoff saves her he immediately asked what do you need. He did not want to save the day but help her achieve her goals without taking away her spotlight or asserting manly dominance. Their teamwork was inspiring and they have such a pure relationship that is the perfect example for any young adult learning what it is like to have a healthy relationship. Of course the music in this movie was amazing, Especially Elsas two songs. This movie was about growth, change and doing the next right thing. I would recommend this movie to anyone of any age and i will certainly see it again.","displayName":"Facebook U","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T04:25:19.237Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T04:25:19.780Z","user":{"userId":"d7794233-f2c3-46e9-b58b-1dbb91cb772d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Facebook U","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Phoned it in... we saw kids & parents leave half way in","displayName":"karen  w","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T04:25:14.563Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T04:25:14.563Z","user":{"userId":"505661f9-833c-4b13-8f47-3f20e61b3a50","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"karen  w","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Frozen 2... weve been waiting 7 years for you and you did not disappoint!
