I’m disappointed that Hollywood’s finest are so far removed from quality storytelling and can’t reach half the originality and wit of Hans Christian Andersen. To claim it is based (even loosely) on the “Snow Queen” is the grossest entertainment exaggeration of the year, and it doesn’t add credibility to the filmmakers.","displayName":"Disappointed","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T00:48:43.563Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T00:48:43.563Z","user":{"userId":"A458AC29-CB7B-433C-BCAC-48EF985CF372","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Disappointed","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!
