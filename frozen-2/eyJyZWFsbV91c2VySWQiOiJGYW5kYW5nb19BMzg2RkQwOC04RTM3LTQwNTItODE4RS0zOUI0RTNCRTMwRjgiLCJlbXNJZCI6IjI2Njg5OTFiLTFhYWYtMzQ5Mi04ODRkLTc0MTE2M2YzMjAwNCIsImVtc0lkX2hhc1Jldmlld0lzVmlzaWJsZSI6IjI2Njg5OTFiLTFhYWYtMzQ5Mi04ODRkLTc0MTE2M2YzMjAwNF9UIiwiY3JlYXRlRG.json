This makes the first movie look like an introduction and this is the story that shouldve been told all along. The songs may not be as catchy or hummable as the firsts, but these are complex and gorgeous melodies with meaningful lyrics. Kids will love to see the return of their favorite sisters but this Frozen is more mature. Anna and Elsa grew up with their audience. This blew me away.","displayName":"Dolly Levi","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T02:50:21.556Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T02:50:21.556Z","user":{"userId":"5e896c2a-f214-41bc-b0d5-cf1cb12da09b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dolly Levi","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Magnífico e imperdível","displayName":"Clivisson R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T02:50:00.611Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T02:50:03.844Z","user":{"userId":"977908335","realm":"RT","displayName":"Clivisson R","accountLink":"/user/id/977908335"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Frozen 2 takes the awe inspiring visuals of the first movie to a new level. The story is far more interesting and very well executed. I enjoyed the themes of the movie and the message. At times some of the characters took what was loved about them in the first movie a little too far. But overall this movie was a lot of fun and original.","displayName":"Christopher P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/872428626269237/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T02:49:55.194Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T02:50:01.271Z","user":{"userId":"976942379","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christopher P","accountLink":"/user/id/976942379"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"What a great return to the world of Frozen. Ana and Elsa go on another adventure that is fun from start to finish. The music is fantastic! I'm glad Disney went back to the format of music from start to finish. The first one suffered from the lack of songs but this one did really well. The colors are beautiful and the visuals are so appealing. The only negative is there is, yet again, a lack of a strong villain.
