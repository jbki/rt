I had chills during almost every song because of the power each one held. Where this film fell short for me was the lack of dynamic between characters. All the characters had an amazing dynamic between each other in the beginning, but eventually, the characters get split up and you lose out on a lot of that. the film made me long to see the characters in the wagon again. Normally, I hate the travel parts of films and would prefer the characters to just show up at their destination, but I liked it in this case. A miniature battle between Elsa and the water was brilliant artistically and was a travel sequence because she made it through the sea by the end. However, it didn't last long and the only other travel sequences were Olaf and Anna in a boat which was boring and insignificant and all of the characters in the wagon which held lots of growth for all the characters. The wagon sequence lasted maybe two minutes which may have been the only character dynamic between all the characters. In turn, there is just a huge lack of character dynamic throughout the whole film. All characters by the end go through a change physically or understanding themselves more, but when you have four main characters I would like to see them work off of each other.","displayName":"Jonah Williams","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T19:45:30.455Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T19:45:30.455Z","user":{"userId":"1408e11c-86ec-4f23-9e7d-0b5c087887e9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jonah Williams","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was better than the first one, if that's even possible!","displayName":"Judi D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T19:43:20.059Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T19:43:27.223Z","user":{"userId":"978350001","realm":"RT","displayName":"Judi D","accountLink":"/user/id/978350001"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"}]}
