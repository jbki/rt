Felt like it belonged in a Shrek movie more than anything), and was full of cheap gags that left me cringing. On its own it is an enjoyable song, so if Disney had axed it from the final cut and used it as a stand-alone promotional piece, it would have been enjoyed much more, and would have left more time to develop the plot\n-Kristoff as a character was hallow and far too two-dimensional. He was inconsequential to the overall plot of the movie , and his only role was as a love-interest to Anna; this is upsetting given his importance and depth as a character in the first movie.","displayName":"Landon B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T19:02:07.415Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T19:02:10.410Z","user":{"userId":"978400929","realm":"RT","displayName":"Landon B","accountLink":"/user/id/978400929"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Me and my family loved it!","displayName":"Kathy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T19:01:44.525Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T19:01:44.525Z","user":{"userId":"1ADA845C-0319-4260-96A2-80D15D3B98F2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kathy","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Disney sequel ever made","displayName":"Milton T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T19:00:53.215Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T19:00:53.215Z","user":{"userId":"DDBD3D1E-6B86-422D-96AE-F16A13CC4474","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Milton T","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"}]}
