This story acts as a continuation of the world that was created in the first one. And while it has more than its fair share of ups and downs, there is something truly magical to be found. As it tells a much-needed story, about the unknown and accepting yourself.\n\nThe story of Frozen II is very interesting, and much needed today. However, it does not have time to state where each character is when the movie begins. This makes it hard to determine how much they actually change by the end of the movie, or if they change at all. And since this movie is supposed to be a grand character journey, it's kind of a letdown. Frozen II also falls under sequel-ites as it tries to compact too many things in one movie, its many side characters are not used to their full potential but the only serve purpose is to give some cringeworthy exposition. The movie could have been better if they had just spent a little more time with them, it would have flushed out the conflict and the mystery that it sets up. Some of the dialogue as well comes off pretty corny, unbelievable that seems to be used as thinly veiled foreshadowing. Overall the story that the movie is trying to tell is too big for only an hour and a half.\n\n Frozen II story is very ambitious and while it can get very on the nose a couple of times, the parallel between whats going on in the film and what is going on in the movie. It's a tough pill to swallow but one that has to be accepted, and understood. On the animation side of things, this movie is absolutely phenomenal with some scenes going to go down in history and will be talked about for years to come. Its also amazing just how lifelike it can actually be, but at the same time be coincide completely with other cartoonish features. Musically Frozen II surpasses its predecessor. Granted there is no song that ªs quite an earworm like Let It Go, but some come really close. As a collective the songs in this movie as a collective surpass previous, every song is much more powerful and heartfelt than the entirety of the original ªs soundtrack. The score in this film is without a doubt the best Disney score that has made this decade, with every single one of the cast lending their voice for enduring performance. Frozen II also continues in the path of its previous movie has done, with its flipping the idea of Disney ªs Princess trope on its head and continues to build the characters up from when the last film lest them at. Elsa ªs journey, in particular, is a highlight. Her growth that she stared when she sang Let it Go reaches its natural conclusion, one that is beautiful and as equally cinematic.\n\nThis movie is problematic in the sense that it does not succeed in everything that it tries to do, what makes it a masterpiece is that it's also a movie that will make you burst into tears as well as you can ªt help as well as in for a whole new adventure that is thrilling and a treat for all your senses. Now if it was only a half an hour longer.","displayName":"Michael O","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001809369788/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T05:29:14.378Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T05:29:47.708Z","user":{"userId":"906375140","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael O","accountLink":"/user/id/906375140"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Nowhere near as good as the first.
