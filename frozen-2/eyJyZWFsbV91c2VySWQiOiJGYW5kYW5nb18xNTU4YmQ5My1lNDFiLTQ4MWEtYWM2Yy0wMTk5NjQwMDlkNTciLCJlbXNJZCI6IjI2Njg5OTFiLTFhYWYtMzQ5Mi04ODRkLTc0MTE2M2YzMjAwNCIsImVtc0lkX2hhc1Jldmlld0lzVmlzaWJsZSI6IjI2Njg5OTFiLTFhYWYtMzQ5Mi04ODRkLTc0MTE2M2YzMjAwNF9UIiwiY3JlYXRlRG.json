The story line is good and the movie pokes fun at itself a bit so that's fun to see too. There are some (not a lot) intense parts so if you have a young kiddo that's sensitive to that they may be covering their eyes or wanting to sit with you sometimes.","displayName":"Angela H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T04:30:10.262Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T04:30:10.381Z","user":{"userId":"8953e100-f943-4113-8c0e-3cc3e8d2f170","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Angela H","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it.
