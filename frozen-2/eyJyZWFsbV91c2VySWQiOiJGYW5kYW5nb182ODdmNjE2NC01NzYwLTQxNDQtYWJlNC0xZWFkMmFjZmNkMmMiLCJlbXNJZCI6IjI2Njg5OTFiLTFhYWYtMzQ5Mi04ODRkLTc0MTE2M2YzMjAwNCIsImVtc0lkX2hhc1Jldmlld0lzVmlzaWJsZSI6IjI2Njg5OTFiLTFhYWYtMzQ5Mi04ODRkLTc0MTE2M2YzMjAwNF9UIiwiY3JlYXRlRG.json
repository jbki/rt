Well, I was wrong. Lightening struck twice here. Disney did an absolutely beautiful job telling this story and focusing on what it means to grow up, protect the ones you love, and have compassion. Great message, great songs, hilarious and heartfelt. Olaf had me laughing so hard I needed to catch my breath. Definitely a must see for all ages.","displayName":"Lizzy S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1791927628/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T05:57:03.846Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T05:57:07.106Z","user":{"userId":"878961431","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lizzy S","accountLink":"/user/id/878961431"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Omg I cried!

The soundtrack, in my opinion, is better than the original. Animation: beautiful. I teared up a little bit (spoilers) when Olaf disappeared. However, I do feel like the plot was a little \"iffy\". It seemed like they were trying to find some kind of plot to make a sequel, because some things just felt a little rush and answers to problems seemed to come too easily to the characters. And during Kristoff's song, I felt they made the scene too childish for a heartfelt song. It just kinda rubbed me the wrong way in the theater while watching it. I get it's a \"children's\" movie, but that wasn't the song to try to make the movie funny. But the messages in the story about dealing with hard things, family, and complex feelings are nicely put out. There were many funny moments in the film as well, and some fun callbacks to the original. Frozen 2 beats out its original with songs, animation, and humor, but the original has a better storyline that makes more sense. I'd happily watch Frozen 2 again and again. Time to play the soundtrack on my Spotify over and over.","displayName":"Marina C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/158138175405686/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T05:51:33.363Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T05:51:39.084Z","user":{"userId":"978400098","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marina C","accountLink":"/user/id/978400098"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Better than the first!! I couldn't stop smiling when I left the theater and I truly felt like a kid again!! I laughed my head off, I cried, I gasped and I felt warm and fuzzy inside. This movie will take you on an emotional roller coaster and I can't wait to buy it on dvd!! Stunning animation and a script so cleverly written that the writers should clear a shelf for their impending awards. I won tickets to the premier on the 19th so I paid nothing. I would pay this time to go see it again while still in theaters. Once busy wasn't enough!! Oh and be prepared to fall in love with fire spirit. I did!!!! Bought a beanie baby on the way home!!!
