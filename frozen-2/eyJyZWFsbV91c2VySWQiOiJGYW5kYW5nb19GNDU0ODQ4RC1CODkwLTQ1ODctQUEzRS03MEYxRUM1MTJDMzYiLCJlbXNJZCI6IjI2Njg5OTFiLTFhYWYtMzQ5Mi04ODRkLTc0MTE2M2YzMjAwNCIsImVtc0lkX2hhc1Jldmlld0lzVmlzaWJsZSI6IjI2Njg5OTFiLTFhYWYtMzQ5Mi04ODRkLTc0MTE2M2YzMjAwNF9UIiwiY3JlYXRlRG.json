For this reason I would steer clear of IMAX and see it in its intended Scope aspect ratio. So many scenes depend on the scope lens to portray lonesomeness of the characters and the filmmakers use ever inch of the frame that to see it in another format would be a loss to the viewer. Story wise the film is strong too. It dives deeper into the mythology of Christian Anderson's \"Snow Queen\" without abandoning the characters, music and comedic timing of the first film. All and all an amazing beautiful film!","displayName":"Matthew B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T23:07:46.802Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T23:07:58.049Z","user":{"userId":"977993258","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew B","accountLink":"/user/id/977993258"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great movie, me, my wife and both kids all thought it was better than the first. great story, funny, had it all.","displayName":"dustin","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T23:06:13.759Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T23:06:13.759Z","user":{"userId":"F2104768-944A-471F-AC01-1B439EA1A6A8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"dustin","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"LOVED IT.
