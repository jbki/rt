Oh, they're there, but from one scene to the next, I felt like must have missed 5-10 minutes of a scene. There's no transition and little exposition from one scene to another, which brings me to... 2) Disney feature animation are musicals. They've been so for (quite literally) a century. So the fact that music plays a major role in the film isn't exactly a surprise. However, while the musical numbers in Lion King, Aladdin, Tangled, tie seamlessly into and work with the plot, all I want to do is phone home when the Frozen 2 songs start up. It's not as bad as an opera in which even a simple \"no\" has to be sung for X-amount of beats, but the songs feel OBTRUSIVE rather than LUBRICATING the experience, if that makes any sense. I felt as if I were being forced to sit through the songs here whereas in other Disney features (even the really heavy musicals like Beauty and the Beast), the musical numbers flowed organically with the rest of the experience.","displayName":"Dan G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T04:31:42.234Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T04:31:46.375Z","user":{"userId":"977140282","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dan G","accountLink":"/user/id/977140282"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a good sequel to the first Frozen.","displayName":"Porsha  J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T04:25:20.815Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T04:25:20.815Z","user":{"userId":"3BF9BF40-6053-4B02-9AAF-032C3400BE83","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Porsha  J","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Was great!
