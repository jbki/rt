I would caution those taking young children though.  This movie was much, much darker than the original.  I took my 2.5 year old (this was her first movie) and there were parts where she did get scared.  I think this was geared more towards child fans of the original at their current age (i.e. 6 years older).  So, I would recommend this, but be cautioned it's not a happy go lucky tale.","displayName":"Mike","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-10T11:22:33.409Z","updateDate":"2019-12-10T11:22:33.409Z","user":{"userId":"ec6d5148-8be7-41fd-b406-a2a4a1d700d0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mike","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was very easy to follow the plot line.
