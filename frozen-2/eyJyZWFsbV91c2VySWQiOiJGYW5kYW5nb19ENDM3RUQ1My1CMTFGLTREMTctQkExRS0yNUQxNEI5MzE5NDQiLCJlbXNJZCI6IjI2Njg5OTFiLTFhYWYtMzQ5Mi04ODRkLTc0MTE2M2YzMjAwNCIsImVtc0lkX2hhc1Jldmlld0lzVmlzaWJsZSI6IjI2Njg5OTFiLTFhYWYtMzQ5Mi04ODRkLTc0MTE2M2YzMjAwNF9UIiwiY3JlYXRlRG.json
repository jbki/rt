Olaf still manages to steal the show as everyone's favorite sentient snowman, now with a little extra growing pains. Kristoff even gets a song, although he's stuck on the sidelines for most of the movie. A fun kids movie but nothing showstopping.","displayName":"Melanie G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10215060135763048/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-14T01:32:33.830Z","updateDate":"2019-12-14T01:32:43.724Z","user":{"userId":"978223949","realm":"RT","displayName":"Melanie G","accountLink":"/user/id/978223949"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Ending was just ok...","displayName":"Elizabeth","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-14T01:29:17.117Z","updateDate":"2019-12-14T01:29:17.117Z","user":{"userId":"84FCF98A-B71E-4EE8-99D3-E9136D7FF8D0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Elizabeth","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Our family loved it!
