Comparing it to Frozen, it is not up to that level. For a movie called frozen 2, there was too much Autumn, and not enough snow. I only heard one outstanding song. The rest were so so. I am starting to believe that when Disney has the well known actors sing the songs, their voices cannot compare to the earlier movies where not so well known actors sung the songs, such as Beauty and The Beast. I do give it thumbs up for the cinematography, especially during the second half of the movie.","displayName":"Billy S B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T17:06:08.389Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T17:06:20.143Z","user":{"userId":"900949479","realm":"RT","displayName":"Billy S B","accountLink":"/user/id/900949479"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"}]}
