I'd missed your lovable characters and monster ballads. While you weren't Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen sequel bad, at times you bordered on a made for DVD movie. This was the first Disney movie without a single memorable song. Olaf was cute with his existential crisis. Sven was great. Elsa Jaded and Anna was Anna. But aside from an 80s power ballad music video scene, parents will love watching their kids watch Frozen 2 without the mutual enjoyment We've come to expect in every Disney movie.  It just isn't there this time.","displayName":"Nicholas A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1475719402/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T05:11:42.886Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T05:11:46.750Z","user":{"userId":"839020993","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nicholas A","accountLink":"/user/id/839020993"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Visuals were stunning.
