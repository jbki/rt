The characters were good, although they were going through same struggles of \"finding self\" and \"not getting shut out\", so there was some staleness there. Olaf has some really funny scenes that causes actual audible laughter. And the 80's music video scene with Kristoff was quite sarcastically intelligent, in my opinion. I felt there were some holes in the overall storyline, as well as playing out the obvious that left me wishing for more. I would say it was a goodnight out with the family, but it lacked the pioneering entertainment value that the first Frozen had.","displayName":"Jade W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/691403392/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T14:13:25.042Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T14:13:29.310Z","user":{"userId":"961062447","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jade W","accountLink":"/user/id/961062447"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The Cga was fabulous.

On a whole I found the movie to be dark the ending didn’t leave you with a light step but left you wondering if you saw a child’s animation or not. Overall the animation was beautiful the colors rich and storyline engaging. There was a lot of music which I don’t mind if it helps move the story along which it really didn’t they were more just songs tailored to each character. I did like that Disney tried to have the story mature with the aging original audience and attempted to put in some great mental health practices. I wish that they would have clued us into that during some of the trailers.
