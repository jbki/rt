They answered a lot of the questions I had from the first one! Good flashbacks and references to the first movie. The sister bond, the characters and emotion is mainly why I loved the first movie. This one really capitialized on that! Olaf was hilarious, the star of the comedy! And I loved the music! Could have done without Olaf's song, but I was singing during Elsa's Into the Unknown. They put a lot of thought into this. A bit confusing sometimes, but I managed to piece it all together at the end. Good surprises and plot twists. Great action! It was as good as the trailers and tv spots portrayed. :)","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T18:22:20.264Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T18:22:20.264Z","user":{"userId":"260014011","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260014011"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved that it picks up from the first film. Some questions has been cleared up from the first film as well. Musical Score was amazing can’t wait to get the soundtrack. Can’t wait for this film to come out to home video. Cast was amazing as always and some new animation styles was a nice touch to not only the musical score, but the action sequences as well. Overall I would see this film multiple times just to catch any Disney Easter eggs and more mysteries to the magical world of Frozen.","displayName":"Jazzer","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T18:21:06.664Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T18:21:06.664Z","user":{"userId":"B0F1EDA1-BFF2-4B11-BC8A-5ADF57A2C823","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jazzer","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved loved, the continuation of the story.
