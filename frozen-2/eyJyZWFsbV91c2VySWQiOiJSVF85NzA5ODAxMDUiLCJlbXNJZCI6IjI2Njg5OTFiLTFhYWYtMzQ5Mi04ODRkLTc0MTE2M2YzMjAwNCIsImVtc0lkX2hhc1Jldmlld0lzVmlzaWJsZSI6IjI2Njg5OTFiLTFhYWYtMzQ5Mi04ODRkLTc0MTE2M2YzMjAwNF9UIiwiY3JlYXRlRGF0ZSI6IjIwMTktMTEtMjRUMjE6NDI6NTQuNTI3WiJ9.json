Dams can prove to be an excellent source of clean energy and dams also provide water in the summertime, especially in a state like mine that has  experienced years of drought. There was also a lot of weird spiritualism in this movie. It was fun but not as good as the first Frozen.","displayName":"Ro S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T21:39:25.924Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T21:39:26.899Z","user":{"userId":"977692788","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ro S","accountLink":"/user/id/977692788"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved the music.
