It's more of the same with a retread of the same cast without anything really new. I would have liked a stronger emphasis the villain (if you can even call \"it\" that), and some new heroes; or really anything to give Frozen 2 the kick-start it needed. It's passes the time, but it's nothing I'd enjoy rewatching.
