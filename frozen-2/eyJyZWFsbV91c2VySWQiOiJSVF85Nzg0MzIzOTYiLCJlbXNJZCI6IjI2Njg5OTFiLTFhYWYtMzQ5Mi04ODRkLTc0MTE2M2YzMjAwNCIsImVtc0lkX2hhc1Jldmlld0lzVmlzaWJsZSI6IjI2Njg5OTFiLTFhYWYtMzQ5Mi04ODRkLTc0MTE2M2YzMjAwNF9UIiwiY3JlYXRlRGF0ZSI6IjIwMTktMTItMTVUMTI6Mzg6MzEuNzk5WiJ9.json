Autumnal vibe to it added an aspect of mise-en-scene and beauty that Frozen I lacked. Although the storyline was predictable to some degree, it was done just well enough to pull off a fresh take on the \"white kingdom takes on natives\" trope. The songs were well written, although not as catchy as Frozen I, still remained stuck in my head days after.","displayName":"Sherry Y","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T09:42:46.124Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T09:42:46.124Z","user":{"userId":"978432198","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sherry Y","accountLink":"/user/id/978432198"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie.
