There is a sense of humor in the movie that adults can enjoy.  The movie jumps right into the story keeping the pace fast.  Characters stay true to who they are.

So that says everything!  I personally loved it because I liked getting to know the characters better and seeing them work together as a family. Most Disney sequels are horrendous but they obviously took the time to get the music right and the story and humorous moments just right to compete with the legacy of Frozen. Definitely a must see!!!","displayName":"Kylee S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T20:17:26.093Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T20:17:30.066Z","user":{"userId":"978402673","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kylee S","accountLink":"/user/id/978402673"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great story good for all ages","displayName":"Angel G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T20:16:44.002Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T20:16:44.002Z","user":{"userId":"5CE38694-40F1-4862-BCDB-08F007BBF0B8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Angel G","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved everything about this new movie songs animation and the story was beautiful","displayName":"Lilu","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T20:16:03.225Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T20:16:03.225Z","user":{"userId":"2BB69EF5-7E76-4354-8FB9-DD4A03C3601D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Lilu","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great Movie in 3D.
