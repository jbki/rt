They may have been able to salvage the poor writing for a happy ending but that did not happen. The movie was more of a hystorical fiction tale of white Europeans destroying the way of life of indigenous people rather than an original thought or plot.  Making the Grandfather a murderer....Really Disney? None of the songs were catchy, Laughable moments were null.
