I was disappointed in this movie. The things that made the first one so special were non-existent in the sequel. The film completely over extended itself and suffered in the process. It also borrowed heavily from several other films (Lord of the Rings, The Fifth Element, and I definitely got a Superman cave of solitude vibe from a place that Elsa went) it’s too bad, I really wanted to love it, but all I feel is let down. There are so many things that could have been done better.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T06:09:00.773Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T06:09:10.171Z","user":{"userId":"260081963","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260081963"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I liked the movie.
