Many play off it being bad for just being \"A Children's Film\" , but that doesn't mean films for children can't be enjoyed by a more mature audience. The songs were forgettable, and walking out of the theatre my fellow watchers thought we had a stroke. Jonathan Groff's singing was slightly enjoyable, but the whole boyband reindeer group was a literal drug trip. Olaf's sudden remarks that were played out to be \"hilarious\" made me feel as if he was trying way too hard. After Olaf got \"Thanos snapped\" I thought that it would be the ending of his terrible remarks and awful humor. Instead it brought Ana's darkness is dark moment, which then led up to her trying to destroy her home and birthplace Arendelle. Why did the group leave Kristoff in the beginning with Ryder, who I think is a better love interest for Kristoff then Ana ever will be. Elsa leaving Arendelle for the spirit woods was a mistake because it doesn't show her overcoming her fright of ruling Arendelle. Ana and her naive self would be an awful leader for Arendelle and would probably lead to be the downfall of Arendelle. Frozen 3 Arendelle is a dictatorship,or Frozen 3 Arendelle is communist, the only absolute ending of the Frozen series.","displayName":"Bob G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T01:26:24.861Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T01:26:44.832Z","user":{"userId":"978415023","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bob G","accountLink":"/user/id/978415023"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great story.
