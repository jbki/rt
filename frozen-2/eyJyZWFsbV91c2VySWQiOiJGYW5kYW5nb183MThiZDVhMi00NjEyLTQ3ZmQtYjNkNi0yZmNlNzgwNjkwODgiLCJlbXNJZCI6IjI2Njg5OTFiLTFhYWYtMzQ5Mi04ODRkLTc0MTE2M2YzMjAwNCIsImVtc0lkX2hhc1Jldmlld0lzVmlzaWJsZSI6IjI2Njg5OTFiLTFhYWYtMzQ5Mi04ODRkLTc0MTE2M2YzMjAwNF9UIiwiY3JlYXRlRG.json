It also provides more insight on Elsa's powers and a more happy ending to the isolated feelings she always had as a person with a powerful magic. Honestly, the only draw and highlight of this movie is Elsa because the singer Idrina's voice is so powerful and epic that any song she sings, leaves you breathless while everyone else was along for the ride and their songs seemed just thrown in, to complete a soundtrack. everyone had a song number which, I felt was unnecessary and a bit too much. I felt the character of Elsa was the reason why Frozen was a hit because, the iconic voice of Idrina made the song powerful and epic. the new songs into the unknown and the better show yourself show another range of Idrina's powerful voice and the songs are powerful and emotional. Unfortunately, the other songs in the films are just forgettable and some characters seem a bit more likeable in this version since, they do actually attempt to give some of them, some maturity which provided some depth to the characters that weren't really developed on the first one. I only wished that they would have spaced out some of the songs and cut some of them out, because it seemed like every few minutes, someone had to to sing and there seemed no reason behind it except, that Disney wanted to bank on more songs for the movie. The only songs that seemed to have some actual real meaning to them was Elsa's songs and even Anna's songs which showed more growth for the characters.","displayName":"Eslyn R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T01:00:49.111Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T01:00:49.111Z","user":{"userId":"1328E3CC-B423-4E08-B6A1-66A3FF0D4671","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Eslyn R","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great follow up to the original story!","displayName":"Eric","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T01:00:35.847Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T01:00:35.847Z","user":{"userId":"DABCD3D2-6D53-45F3-8698-66C55D708612","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Eric","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"}]}
