I really liked the first movie and the short films in the franchise but I absolutely loved this second movie for a lot of various reasons. Based on the trailers and the darker tone it had really caught my interest right away and it delivered after viewing it in the theatre. The storyline was pretty solid, music was once again good like the first one and actually for the first time I tiered up at a couple of them because of how emotional they were. Cast did a heck of a job on each of their characters! Will definitely see it again and buy it on Blu-Ray when it becomes available","displayName":"Taylor B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001401103727/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T06:45:38.139Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T06:45:48.158Z","user":{"userId":"929573808","realm":"RT","displayName":"Taylor B","accountLink":"/user/id/929573808"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved that loaf had a more active role with the scenes.","displayName":"Tiffanie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T06:44:10.221Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T06:44:10.221Z","user":{"userId":"70ee740d-9fd9-42f9-8909-19e856152cd8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tiffanie","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The kids loved it..So did I.","displayName":"Wendy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T06:43:51.370Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T06:43:51.370Z","user":{"userId":"79c3f1ee-ac31-4eeb-bd8f-fbe7842e44ff","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Wendy","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"better than I thought.","displayName":"Jill","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T06:40:48.543Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T18:07:08.867Z","user":{"userId":"83BF01A2-8CC7-4C07-92A0-B45BB5DE08B6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jill","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely great movie...","displayName":"Zimeng Y","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T06:37:19.938Z","updateDate":"2019-12-13T19:16:21.568Z","user":{"userId":"829FFB15-AF75-4F00-9E71-B79C510444D8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Zimeng Y","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing....better than the first!","displayName":"ALONZO T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T06:36:55.565Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T04:33:13.152Z","user":{"userId":"163F4304-D80F-4361-8DEE-A99223B5956B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"ALONZO T","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Beautifully designed but the story seemed thrown together.
