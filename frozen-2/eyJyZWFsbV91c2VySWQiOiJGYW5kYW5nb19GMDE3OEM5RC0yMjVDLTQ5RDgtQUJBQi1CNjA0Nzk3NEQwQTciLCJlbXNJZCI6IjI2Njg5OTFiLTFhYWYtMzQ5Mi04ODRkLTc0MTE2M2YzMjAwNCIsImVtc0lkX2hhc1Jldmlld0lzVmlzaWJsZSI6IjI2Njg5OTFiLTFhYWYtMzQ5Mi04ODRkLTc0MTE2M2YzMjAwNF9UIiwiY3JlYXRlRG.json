It had a great storyline, full of adventure, beautiful scenes and lots of anticipation (Sitting on the edge of the seat scenes)     However,  I like the first one better.   The first one was far more light-hearted, fun, charming  and cute with some adventure.   I felt true Disney magic in the first. Let it go is a classic song..  a feel good song!  The songs in the first were better, much more catchy and easy to sing a long.   The second was a little dark and gloomy or a bit too serious.   I missed the witty, funny and feisty Ana.  Her role in the second was far too serious this time.     I also didn't like the Kristoff and Sven song.  It was cheesy.     As an adult, I was waiting for the adult humor as well.    Again, I liked it, it just need a bit more humor and charm to it.","displayName":"Joanne B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/746261288/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T03:20:12.078Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T03:22:18.988Z","user":{"userId":"931435511","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joanne B","accountLink":"/user/id/931435511"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome sequel to an already great Disney movie.","displayName":"Kervins","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T03:19:41.533Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T03:19:41.533Z","user":{"userId":"602C6519-F7A3-4B8F-878D-60893B164ADD","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kervins","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"too many bizarre songs .And there was no real story. or climax","displayName":"Syed M Sarim A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T03:14:48.947Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T03:14:48.947Z","user":{"userId":"8ade11ba-3bdc-42d9-b1cd-9714843e569d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Syed M Sarim A","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved the way it ended with Anna being the hero!","displayName":"Frozen fan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T03:12:18.575Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T03:12:18.575Z","user":{"userId":"6BD451F1-7C6D-42A8-9448-25D755CE9A43","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Frozen fan","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Where it's predecessor I liked, I loved Frozen II, it raised the stakes thematically and musically.
