Searching one's past in not always a linear journey sometimes knowledge comes in bursts and not as a steady flow. Maybe there was one song too many towards the start, but many musicals start this way: I don't think this is enough to rate the movie other than \"must see.\" Oh, by the way, the animation was amazing.
