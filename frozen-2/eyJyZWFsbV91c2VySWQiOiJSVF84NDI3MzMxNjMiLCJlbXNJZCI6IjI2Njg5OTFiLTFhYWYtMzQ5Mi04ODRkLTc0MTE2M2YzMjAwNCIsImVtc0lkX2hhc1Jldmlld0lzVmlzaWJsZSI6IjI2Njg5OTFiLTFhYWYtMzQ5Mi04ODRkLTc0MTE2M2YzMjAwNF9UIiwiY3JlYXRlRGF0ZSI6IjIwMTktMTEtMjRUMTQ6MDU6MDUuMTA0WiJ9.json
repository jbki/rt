The movie really gets you when tragedy hits Elsa and Olaf, but Anna shows how grief can still be overcome to do what needs to be done. \nWe loved the movie!!","displayName":"Facebook U","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T13:54:41.713Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T13:54:41.713Z","user":{"userId":"f095d595-1302-42af-93cb-b65b82b8721f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Facebook U","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Fun for the whole family.","displayName":"Scott R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T13:53:56.598Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T13:53:56.598Z","user":{"userId":"96fc1ea6-2b56-44ec-aeab-1cbeb7d64ff3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Scott R","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"}]}
