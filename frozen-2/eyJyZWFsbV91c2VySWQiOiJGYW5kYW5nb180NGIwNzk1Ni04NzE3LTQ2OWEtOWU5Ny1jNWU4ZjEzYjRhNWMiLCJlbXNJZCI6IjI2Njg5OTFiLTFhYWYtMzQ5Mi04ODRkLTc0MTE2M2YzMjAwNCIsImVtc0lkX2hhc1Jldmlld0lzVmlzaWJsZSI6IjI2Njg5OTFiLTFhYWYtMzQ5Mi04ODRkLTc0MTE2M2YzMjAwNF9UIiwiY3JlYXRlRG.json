Frozen 2 was mysterious, suspensful, magical, compelling, had a excellent plot, even a little bit dark And i could not think of a better ending for the sisters. The only real issue I had with the movie is to much singing and they even quoted a meme, seriously!? There where 4-5 good songs out of the seven based on my opinion.","displayName":"Rachael E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2490612234484404/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T04:57:32.211Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T04:57:49.231Z","user":{"userId":"978405023","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rachael E","accountLink":"/user/id/978405023"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing movie.
