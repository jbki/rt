Definitely geared towards older kids, plot got a bit complicated for little kids.  Standard Disney animation movie, lots of singing, someone dies, crew comes to rescue to save everyone.  I guess they had to make a Frozen sequel, I would have too for the money!  If you have children under 6, go, if older, wait.","displayName":"cary i","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T16:47:13.151Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T16:47:16.829Z","user":{"userId":"978036923","realm":"RT","displayName":"cary i","accountLink":"/user/id/978036923"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"I was disappointed  \nI liked seeing the parents and hearing a back story, but the movie was too dark and the music not impressed.","displayName":"Wanda B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T16:34:38.327Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T16:34:38.327Z","user":{"userId":"c72a454e-ee0c-46a2-a56b-17138537c320","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Wanda B","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I thought this film was better than the first one for a few reasons: First, the worldbuilding was vastly improved so that magic (in general) makes a lot more sense now rather than the first film's \"ordinary Norway + random ice girl.\" It just feels a lot more cohesive now to have magical entities everywhere. And second: the film focuses on Elsa this time around--last film she was also the most interesting character, but last film it focused on almost everyone BUT Elsa so it's great to have the focus in the right place this time.\n\nAs for some minor nitpicks the twist isn't exactly surprising and they could have cut 3 entire songs out of the film, but since it was more driven and lore-filled than the original I definitely preferred it. Olaf's humor was surprisingly on point as well, he could have very easily degraded into a \"Mater\"-like character.","displayName":"Carlotta 4","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T16:18:09.823Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T16:18:21.027Z","user":{"userId":"904384280","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carlotta 4","accountLink":"/user/id/904384280"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"As adults watching Frozen II we found it to be very entertaining with good story line & messaging.
