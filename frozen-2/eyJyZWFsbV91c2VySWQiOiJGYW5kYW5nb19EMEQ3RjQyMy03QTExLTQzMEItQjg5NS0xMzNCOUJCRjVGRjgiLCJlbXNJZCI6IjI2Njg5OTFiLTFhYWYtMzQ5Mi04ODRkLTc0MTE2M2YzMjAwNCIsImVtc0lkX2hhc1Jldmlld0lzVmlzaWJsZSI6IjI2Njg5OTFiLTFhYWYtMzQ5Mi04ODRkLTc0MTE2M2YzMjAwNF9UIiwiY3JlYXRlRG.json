Going into seeing it I had soo many expectations and things i wanted to see happen!  However upon seeing it again I realized that I can’t be upset that the story took a different direction and ended up loving it with this new outlook! I am also completely addicted to the songs! Into the unknown and show yourself is sooo good! And that sound that appears through the movie “ahh ahhh ahh ahhh” (sorry I tried) is stuck in my head and I love it ! Great sequel!!!  And very funny- Olaf crushes it!","displayName":"Mike C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T07:03:39.173Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T07:03:39.173Z","user":{"userId":"F3CD81A5-C5D9-4867-988F-FCBEC14F8ACC","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mike C","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was geared towards and older crowd for kids.","displayName":"Kacey S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T07:02:47.362Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T07:02:47.362Z","user":{"userId":"5b180155-0a15-4988-b2c0-a279b02ef1f9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kacey S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Would definitely pay to watch this movie again","displayName":"Cheldine","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T06:55:12.243Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T06:55:12.243Z","user":{"userId":"94BED129-CB1F-4AE8-B744-6666B7D95435","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Cheldine","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I was a fan of the first Frozen, but never really was obsessed with it until recently.
