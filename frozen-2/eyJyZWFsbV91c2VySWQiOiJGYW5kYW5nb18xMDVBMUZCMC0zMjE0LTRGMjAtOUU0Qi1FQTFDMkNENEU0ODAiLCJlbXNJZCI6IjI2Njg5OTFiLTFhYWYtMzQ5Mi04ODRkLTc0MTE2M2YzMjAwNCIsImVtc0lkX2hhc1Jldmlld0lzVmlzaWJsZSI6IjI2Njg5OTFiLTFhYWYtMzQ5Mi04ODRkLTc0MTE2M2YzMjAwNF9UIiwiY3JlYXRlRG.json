So recommended for anybody, go see it and take your kids if you are a parent. It is even better than the first one in my opinion. It was amazing with GORGEOUS jaw dropping animation, lovely music and catchy songs throughout and not to forget the amazing heartfelt storyline with the right balance of adventure, action, comedy and emotion. Very lovable characters. Disney animation did it again. They have been on a roll and is clearly having another reneissance since the release of fantastic animation movies one after another since 2010 with Tangled, Wreck-it Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6, Zootopia, Moana, Ralph Breaks the Internet and now Frozen 2. The last time Disney had this kind of reneissance was in 1990s during my childhood with the release of The Little Mermaid, Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, Pocahontas, Hercules, Mulan and Tarzan. Frozen 2 was simply breathtaking. Saw it in IMAX and it worths every single penny. My grade: A+. ❄️☃️","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T22:38:58.264Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T22:38:58.264Z","user":{"userId":"189232174","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/189232174"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"reserved lounge seats and they were stadium seats","displayName":"Mellody fox","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T22:34:01.390Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T22:34:01.390Z","user":{"userId":"34E511BA-77A7-4172-8283-A8DA62C568AA","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mellody fox","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it \nBetter bring some tissue with you \nMe And my 3 year enjoyed, so did all my nieces they all cried!!","displayName":"Jenny&lailah","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T22:33:15.184Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T22:36:01.236Z","user":{"userId":"3de898e8-7140-49a7-b35a-bcbebe0bf979","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jenny&lailah","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great story following the first.
