The film itself isn't bad, it passes the time well and is entertaining but everything about it is so forgettable including the songs.  The most frustrating part is the complete lack of respect for the plot of the first film.  The parent's backstory is explained in Frozen 2 and it makes no sense within the context of the first film.  The parents' motivations are completely flipped causing huge plot holes created in the first film.","displayName":"lance r","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T00:11:14.873Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T00:11:25.402Z","user":{"userId":"974735714","realm":"RT","displayName":"lance r","accountLink":"/user/id/974735714"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"}]}
