I first purchased tickets through the app. my checking account was charged but no tickets were awarded.  the clerk at the desk confirmed this.  I had to buy additional tickets to get in after arriving to the theater.  there will be more to follow.  it is Christmas Eve so I won't waste anymore of my time ranting.","displayName":"Bryan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T23:28:01.079Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T23:28:01.079Z","user":{"userId":"36F8C0F6-B1E7-4596-8C51-92EF5AB3EA89","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bryan","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love it. it was a beautiful movie. you get a sense of the past and they connect to their parents. absolutely  wonderful!!!","displayName":"Azra","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T23:16:03.844Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T23:16:03.844Z","user":{"userId":"F7078B7D-8B03-40B2-B971-CDFF8FA71EE1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Azra","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The songs and the story are good.","displayName":"Laura S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T23:01:20.726Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T23:01:20.726Z","user":{"userId":"09517373-82DF-49B1-A0DD-12C880A220E5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Laura S","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was amazing!!!!!!","displayName":"Tenisha","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:56:23.770Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:56:23.770Z","user":{"userId":"2C82ED90-D11A-470F-969E-FA0930910D03","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tenisha","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"good plot, but I feel like a lot of the songs take away from the movie","displayName":"Renny","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T22:03:49.654Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T22:03:49.654Z","user":{"userId":"A8CB2E0B-FDF6-4332-82CD-AC70EF42C92C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Renny","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"it was wonderful good for the family","displayName":"Devon Vernon","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T21:51:10.804Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T21:51:10.804Z","user":{"userId":"2282A073-3B3B-4288-80C6-A5BB4502E0C9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Devon Vernon","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The story was great.
