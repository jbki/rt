Too much singing and none of the songs were good, it was very broadwayish. It didnt improve the movie from our perspective. Probably wont buy it on DVD.

Frozen 2 was contrived, at best.  A convoluted B-side to a long-ago super hit.  The script's way-overdone pagan foundation spotlighted and explained Elsa's worsened-over-time dysfunctional life with even more vanity glimpses at her narcissim and personality disorder.  So many would be throughly entertained to know the real work that motivated and inspired the intricacies of this script, Jennifer Lee and Allison Schroeder!  Lastly, the music did not move.  Not one of the songs is, nor will be, a memorable hit to match the fame of \"Let it Go\" in Frozen 1.  The most comical... Kristoff's solo was clearly inspired by Air Supply, circa 1983.
