Didn't have the catchy songs  that were so memorable in part I.   I'm sure parents everywhere appreciate that there's no song that will be on repeat for the next five years. Didn't like that Elsa was \"searching her whole life\" for a female voice calling out to her --kids don't need to see that and probably don't understand the concept.  Glad though that they didn't make her character openly lesbian.  \nWe all really enjoyed this movie!","displayName":"Pinkiesup","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-04T11:23:30.193Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T11:35:17.205Z","user":{"userId":"d90267d4-460f-4b8b-8ebb-2b1fd05788e0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Pinkiesup","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"It wasn’t as good as the first musically.
