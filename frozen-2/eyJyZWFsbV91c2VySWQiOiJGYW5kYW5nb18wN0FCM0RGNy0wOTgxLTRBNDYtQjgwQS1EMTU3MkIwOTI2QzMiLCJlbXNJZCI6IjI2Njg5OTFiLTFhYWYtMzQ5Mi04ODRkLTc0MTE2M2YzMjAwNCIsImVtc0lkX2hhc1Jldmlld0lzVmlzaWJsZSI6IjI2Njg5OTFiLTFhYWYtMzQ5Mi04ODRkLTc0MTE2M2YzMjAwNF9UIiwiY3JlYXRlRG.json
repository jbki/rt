It just fell completely flat for me. The songs were immediately forgettable (literally--I couldn't remember one lyric after leaving). As one reviewer said, the plot was simultaneously confusing and full of holes while still somehow managing to be totally predicable. The characters also acted out-of-character. Some of the scenes and at least one musical number felt more like a parody to me than like I was supposed to take them seriously. My kids, who were die-hard fans of the first movie, were also thoroughly unimpressed. Animation was good, that's about the only positive thing I can say.","displayName":"Katie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-06T18:40:23.126Z","updateDate":"2019-12-06T18:40:23.126Z","user":{"userId":"58339285-adb2-47f7-bbf8-033fb4f722c3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Katie","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"very enjoyable. almost as good as the original.
