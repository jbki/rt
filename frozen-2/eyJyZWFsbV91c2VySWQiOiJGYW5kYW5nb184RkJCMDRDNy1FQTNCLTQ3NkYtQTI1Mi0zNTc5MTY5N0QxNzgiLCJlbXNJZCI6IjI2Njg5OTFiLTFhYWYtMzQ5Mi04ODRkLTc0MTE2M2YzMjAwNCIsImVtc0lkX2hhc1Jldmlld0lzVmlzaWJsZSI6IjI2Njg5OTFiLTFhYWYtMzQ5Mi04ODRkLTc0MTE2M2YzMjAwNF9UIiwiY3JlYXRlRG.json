Visually great. The pagan worship and vague mission (toward the middle of film) lost me a bit. I thought it rather predictable otherwise. Love those characters though. I enjoyed seeing the characters that were previously seen only in gallery paintings. Music was good. Nothing can compare to music of the first one though. Id say -good job. Not great job.
