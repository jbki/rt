Being honest, you cannot compare the two movies, given to the fact that they couldn't be any more different: while the first installment is Disney at its finest, in other words, a beautiful, easy-to-understand film full of catchy songs, Frozen II surpasses its predecessor when one talks about deepness and complexity, which are shown through a fantastic story-telling style that lets you see the characters in a so much more intimate way, letting you see their growth and even feel part of their personal arc.\nFrozen II will remind you that even when we don't want things to change, life eventually will and it's OK to be scared, we only must live one step at a time. And if that's not the most beautiful message from this mind-blowing franchise, I don't know what is.","displayName":"Rosali M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T00:43:58.591Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T00:44:13.116Z","user":{"userId":"978023711","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rosali M","accountLink":"/user/id/978023711"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Frozen 2 is My Second Favorite Movie Of 2019 Story is Amazing Animation is Beautiful Character is Unforgettable Song is Great Elsa is My Favorite Female Character Of All Time Give This Movie 10/10 Epic Brilliant Masterpieces","displayName":"Nick H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/164869444700719/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T00:42:20.335Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T00:42:29.270Z","user":{"userId":"978298218","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nick H","accountLink":"/user/id/978298218"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The story line was Great, the musical part was way better composed on the First movie.","displayName":"Harley","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T00:33:58.327Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T00:33:58.327Z","user":{"userId":"68C915ED-A40A-4974-8C3A-C40E505FC899","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Harley","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"}]}
