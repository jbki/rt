A lot of the time Disney sequels don't always live up to it's predecessor, but Frozen 2 was really amazing. the songs were generally pretty good. they didn't bore me and they weren't the typical generic sing along songs. I absolutely loved the mysterious aspect of the movie. once again Disney has outdone the animation for this movie. it was so amazingly well done that it looked almost real. frozen 2 is a great film to see on a weekend with friends or to relax and enjoy the story, singing and animation.","displayName":"Nathan H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T00:54:09.248Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T00:54:09.248Z","user":{"userId":"978406122","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nathan H","accountLink":"/user/id/978406122"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"}]}
