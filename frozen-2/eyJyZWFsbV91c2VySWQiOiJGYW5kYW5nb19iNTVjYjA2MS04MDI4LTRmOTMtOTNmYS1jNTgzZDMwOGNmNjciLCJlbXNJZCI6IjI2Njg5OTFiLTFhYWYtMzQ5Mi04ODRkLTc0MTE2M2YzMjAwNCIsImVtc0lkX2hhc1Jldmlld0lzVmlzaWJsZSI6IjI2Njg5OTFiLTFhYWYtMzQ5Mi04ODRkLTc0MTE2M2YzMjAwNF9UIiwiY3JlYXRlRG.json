I just knew it was going to be as great as the first one! Unfortunately, this wasn't the case for either me or my husband. Olaf is still funny. Elsa and Ana and Christoph and Sven are all the same. But the story is just not well-done. There are gaping holes in it and not a super coherent string of events. There's no explanation for why certain events take place or reasoning behind 90% of it. I've come to expect more from Disney than this and yet they also made the newest Dumbo and Finding Dorie so this shouldn't come as a huge shock. With all the hype though and all the time they took to make it, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have put as much effort into the story as they did the graphics. Kids will love it because like I said, Olaf is still funny, but the songs are pretty boring and no one will be going around singing any of them. It was forgetful basically. Don‚Äôt rush off to see it like we did.
