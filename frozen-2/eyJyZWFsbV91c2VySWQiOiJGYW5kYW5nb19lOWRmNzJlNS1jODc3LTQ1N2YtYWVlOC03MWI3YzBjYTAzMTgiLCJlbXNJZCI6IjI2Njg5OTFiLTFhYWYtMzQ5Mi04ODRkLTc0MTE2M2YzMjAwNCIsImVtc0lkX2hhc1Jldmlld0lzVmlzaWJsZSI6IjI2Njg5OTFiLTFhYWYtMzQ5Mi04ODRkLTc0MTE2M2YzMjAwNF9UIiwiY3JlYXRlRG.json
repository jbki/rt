I did not feel like I had missed something by seeing them out of order as it was able to stand on its own and have its own great storyline you could follow. I brought my 2 nieces and more close family to share the experience and I was glad we did as it was a fun event. Nothing was too scary or sad for children to watch at 4 years old. Imagery was wonderful and great plot and story that brought in the first installment","displayName":"Sarah T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T08:26:28.657Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T08:26:28.657Z","user":{"userId":"2de3d137-08e7-47c3-9012-9fcd33063849","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sarah T","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was an awesome movie.
