Much more of a cohesive story. (A few things made me more confused than before, but hey.)    The villain was kind of predictable and Disney seemed to be trying to get 'woke points' with their storyline.   The songs were almost entirely great. Loved a lot of them. And they toned down Olaf so he wasn't so....
