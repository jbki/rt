Disney didn't include an unnecessary villain. This is a movie in which finding your way and growing up are enough. It has deeper themes of stepping out and finding how to be complete in yourself. Remember that the elementary aged kids who cut their teeth on the original movie are now tweens and teensâ€”the right age for these themes. Kids at the age are seeking out their identify. Many are finding that striking out onto their own unique path is scary, and they hold onto things making sense one day. (Olaf's song nails it.)  This movie stands on its own. It gives nods to the original, but like the characters...moves on and finds is own \"place.\"  The songs fit the story and help the characters voice feelings and thoughts without clunky monologues. Thank you Disney for giving us another Princess movie in which the girls don't need to be rescued by Prince Charming and don't need romantic love for a happy ever after. While the movie doesn't set up for a third movie, it will be interesting to see if they mine further character development for Elsa and Anna in a third installment....","displayName":"Caroline R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10212827825723600/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T22:33:24.876Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T22:34:29.543Z","user":{"userId":"976924162","realm":"RT","displayName":"Caroline R","accountLink":"/user/id/976924162"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"songs aren't as good as the first one but good story line.","displayName":"Keona","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T22:31:26.751Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T22:31:26.751Z","user":{"userId":"45A84E1A-A48F-44A0-915C-0FD358938F19","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Keona","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Took two boys (6 and 8) to see it in 3D and they loved it.

Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel and the ensemble cast are great. The animation is visually stunning and the action sequences are perfectly executed. The songs are fantastic! Into the Unknown and Show Yourself is a crowd-pleaser. However, Frozen II does have a problem with its story as it is confusing at some points in the film. It is also a bit bland, as there is no villain and makes it a little less entertaining than its predecessor (3.5 stars).","displayName":"Kyri V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T22:26:27.562Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T05:24:04.018Z","user":{"userId":"977953848","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kyri V","accountLink":"/user/id/977953848"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Nice twist on the original.
