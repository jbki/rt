Though this movie is full of haunting stuff and a real lot of singing, I can still keep myself engaged. Elsa became much prettier (She's the reason I'm in the theaters), I've always liked Elsa, also for the fact that she's troubled and anxious, but potrayed better in the first film.\nOlaf became the Jar Jar Binks in this scenario, but at least he doesn't quite bother the scene, it helps with his development and shows that he's comfortable being around the people.","displayName":"Alif R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/606169610152960/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T18:29:14.844Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T18:29:27.764Z","user":{"userId":"978412741","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alif R","accountLink":"/user/id/978412741"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great film.
