Sadly, this was one of the few highlights for me, along with Olaf, of course! Hes just the cutest and the giggles and adult laughs were the proof that hes a star. I didnt enjoy the story line nearly as much as in the first Frozen. Not a single tear, barely one memorable song... I clearly prefer the first one. In fact, we came home straight to watch the first one afterwards and all felt right again.","displayName":"Karen","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T04:32:25.245Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T04:32:25.245Z","user":{"userId":"ad3487fd-8873-48f0-b513-3380dc554bc0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Karen","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The movie was good.
