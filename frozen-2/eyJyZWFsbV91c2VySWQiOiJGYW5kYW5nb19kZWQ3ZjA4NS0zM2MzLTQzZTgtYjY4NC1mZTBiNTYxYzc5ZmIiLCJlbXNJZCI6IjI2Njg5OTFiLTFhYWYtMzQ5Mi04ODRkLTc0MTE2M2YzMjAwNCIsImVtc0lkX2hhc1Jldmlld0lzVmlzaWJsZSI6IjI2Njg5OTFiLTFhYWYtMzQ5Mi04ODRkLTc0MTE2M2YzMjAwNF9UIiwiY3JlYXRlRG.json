Was kind of dreading going to see it, but it's what the family decided on. Loved it. I enjoyed it more than the original to be honest. The music wasn't as immediately stuck in my head. I remember humming the Summer song and Let it go song from the first one. Don't remember a line from any song in this one. Did like the power ballad for the guy, but couldn't tell you what it was called. Worth seeing for sure. And on the big screen. Really impressive huge visuals that won't be as grand on the small screen.","displayName":"Stephen B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T23:49:51.695Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T23:49:56.606Z","user":{"userId":"978490829","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stephen B","accountLink":"/user/id/978490829"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"it was a very cute movie!","displayName":"Joyce","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T23:44:32.497Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T23:45:21.050Z","user":{"userId":"9CE21B6E-7DE0-49D4-A1D7-703C1A336BB6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joyce","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"even better than the first!","displayName":"Katy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T23:33:01.665Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T23:33:01.665Z","user":{"userId":"F090094B-0E72-4F07-A10C-7534CA68E438","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Katy","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie was amazing!
