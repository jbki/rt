It can't quite top the first but it gets close. The animation and acting is top notch. I don't think anybody expects any less in that regard. The most of the film the story is great and doesn't slow down once it gets going. The first two acts are incredible and beat the original film for me. The third act is where this movie stumbles. The climax feels a bit to quick with some strange character choices. It's almost as if they cut a small chunk out of the film. It doesn't ruin the movie but it does leave you not being fully satisfied. The songs are as great as ever and will be stuck in your head for months. Even with the third act being a bit off, Frozen 2 delivers a great sequel that will leave fans pleased.","displayName":"Isaiah L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1679743282/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T20:35:05.103Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T20:35:13.503Z","user":{"userId":"921194303","realm":"RT","displayName":"Isaiah L","accountLink":"/user/id/921194303"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"you stole my money.
