It was different from the first Frozen in a great way. The characters grew up and faced more complex challenges, but were incredibly loveable the whole journey. Fell in love with their new looks!

However everything else feels like it could have been written in about two months. Nothing feels illogical, but it also doesn't feel perfectly thought through. Also, the film is not even somewhat daring, as everything you know will and won't happen plays out as you expect. I'd basically say it all, but I don't like to get into spoilers in my reviews, even though they are really just obvious outcomes that if you saw the first ten minutes, you would have already guessed.","displayName":"Robert L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T20:29:25.626Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T20:29:32.695Z","user":{"userId":"976406583","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert L","accountLink":"/user/id/976406583"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I really enjoyed this film!","displayName":"Jay Jay","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T20:29:04.214Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T16:35:23.533Z","user":{"userId":"2F63F5D3-03AF-4CAA-A867-60AE19876B9A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jay Jay","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Storyline was slow and weak","displayName":"Amy Winchester","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T20:27:08.107Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T20:27:08.107Z","user":{"userId":"83B843EE-BAC5-4552-B625-24030C0AE3F2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Amy Winchester","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Not much in the way of story line.
