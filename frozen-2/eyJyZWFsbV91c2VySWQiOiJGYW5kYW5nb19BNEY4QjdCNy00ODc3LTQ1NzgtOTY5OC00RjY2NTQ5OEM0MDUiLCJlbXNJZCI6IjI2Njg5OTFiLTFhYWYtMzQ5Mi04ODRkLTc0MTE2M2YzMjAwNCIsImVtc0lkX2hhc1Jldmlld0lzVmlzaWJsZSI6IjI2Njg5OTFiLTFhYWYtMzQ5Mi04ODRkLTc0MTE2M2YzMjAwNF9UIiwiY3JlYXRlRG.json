Both of them had seen the original Frozen on video, but not in the theatre.  Our granddaughter loved the film, which worked at both a kids' and adult level--she was so thrilled that she literally danced in the aisles during the film's lengthy credits.  The themes of the film are decidedly adult:  It is important to learn the truth, and \"do the next right thing.\"  For the kids, the movie was an adventure to turn on the lights and lift the clouds by going to a seemingly magical island--think Dora the Explorer with amazing graphics.  For adults, On the surface, there were no real \"villians\" in real time; the voyage involved understanding the past and making things right, which was surprising only because of the immediacy of those themes in present-day America.  It's Disney and it's G-rated, so you know the ending.  There are some scary moments for the little ones--my grandson wanted to sit on my lap, so be prepared.","displayName":"Richard P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000083163496/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T20:31:30.140Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T20:31:48.795Z","user":{"userId":"915098798","realm":"RT","displayName":"Richard P","accountLink":"/user/id/915098798"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"So good!!

Songs weren't nearly as catchy (except for that \"mysterious\" tune that Elsa hears). Overall, a fine story but the screenplay was abysmal. Sure, it's a kids' movie, but the script is SO dumbed down. Incredibly simplistic. Somehow every character knows exactly what they need to do. \n\nJennifer Lee is the most lucky person in Hollywood. Little talent and a billion dollars in the bank. We should all be so bad.\n\nKristoff's \"80's-music-video\" and Olaf's existential crises were great gags for adults, so why was the rest of the movie so puerile? Disappointing nothing-was-lost endings are Disney's forte, but this might be the worst of the worst.","displayName":"Christopher K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T20:19:02.513Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T20:19:08.391Z","user":{"userId":"977875644","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christopher K","accountLink":"/user/id/977875644"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It was a very good movie  my 4 year old granddaughter was mesmerized","displayName":"Chris A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T20:18:40.748Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T20:18:40.748Z","user":{"userId":"74DDC573-CA7F-4DA2-B626-679ED41B8105","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chris A","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"thought it was kind of sexist didn't like how one of the sisters left Kristoff without even saying goodbye rude wouldn't want my son to date a woman like that","displayName":"Buchanan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T20:18:16.733Z","updateDate":"2019-12-06T14:12:32.738Z","user":{"userId":"69997DEA-BF06-41A8-A6C2-516BFBBD96F3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Buchanan","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it.
