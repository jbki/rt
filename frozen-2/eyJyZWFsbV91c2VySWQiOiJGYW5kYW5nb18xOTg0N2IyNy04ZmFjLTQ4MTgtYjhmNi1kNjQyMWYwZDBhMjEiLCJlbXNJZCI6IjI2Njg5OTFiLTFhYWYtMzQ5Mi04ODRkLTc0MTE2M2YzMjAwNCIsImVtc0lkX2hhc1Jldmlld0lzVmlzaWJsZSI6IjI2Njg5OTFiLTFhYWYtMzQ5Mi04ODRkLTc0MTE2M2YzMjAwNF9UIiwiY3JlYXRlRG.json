The story was so intense and explained alot that the first one didn't. I cried more than I wanted to , but that's not a bad thing. The movie has some dark times at times, bit for good reason. The music was great and the laughs were better. I genuinely like Frozen 2 more than the first.

I waited eagerly for this. But it just made me want to rewatch the first one. For one, all the songs sounded the same, the one song that they wanted to be the next \"let it go\" sounded similar but also forced and misplaced. Singing happened every 2 minutes it seemed like and it feels like you don't get into the story much before they start singing again. Even though the movie is about the two sisters, it felt like there wasn't much of them. Weird, right? I found myself pretty bored and thinking \"I waited this whole time for this?\" and \"come on, it has to get better\". But from the first few minutes, I knew it wasn't going to be good, the dialogue was just...horrible. There were some small small moments I liked, like with the water horse but it just didn't capture my heart. It just felt cheesy like the two sisters embracing after only being separated for 1 minute. I've been told this movie makes people cry, it kinda teared me up at the end but I cry at puppy video on youtube so... I really wish this movie had been better. it was beautifully done but just seemed weak.","displayName":"Jehx V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T04:19:21.867Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T04:19:34.957Z","user":{"userId":"977018422","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jehx V","accountLink":"/user/id/977018422"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Outstanding, 2 kids and 2 adults and we all LOVED it, maybe more than the first!!","displayName":"TNGirl2468","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T04:18:50.072Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T04:18:51.861Z","user":{"userId":"a8b9ee57-be7b-41ac-8519-0ad9c5783f6b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"TNGirl2468","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"My first time ever seeing a Disney movie in over 24 years and I must say!
