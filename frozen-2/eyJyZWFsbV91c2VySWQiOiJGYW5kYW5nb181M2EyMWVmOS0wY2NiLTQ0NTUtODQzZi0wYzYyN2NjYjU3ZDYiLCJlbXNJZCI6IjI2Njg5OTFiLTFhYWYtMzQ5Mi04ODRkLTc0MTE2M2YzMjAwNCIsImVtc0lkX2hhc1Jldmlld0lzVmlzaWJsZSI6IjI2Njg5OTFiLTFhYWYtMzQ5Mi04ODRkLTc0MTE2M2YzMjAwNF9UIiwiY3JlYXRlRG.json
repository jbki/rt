WAY too much singing.  Almost the entire movie is singing.  The songs are not as catchy.. also the lyrics to many of them are very strange.  Anna's song in the cave is especially weird, depressing and using langu most children probably don't even understand.  It's a very strange movie and they tried way too hard to make it more entertaining than the first, but is was really pretty boring and predictable.","displayName":"Alex","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T04:49:06.160Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T04:49:06.160Z","user":{"userId":"c9e56ffb-588d-447c-a571-bfd039cd895b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Alex","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A fun sequel to Frozen which explains the origins of Elsa's ice powers and a look at Elsa and Anna's parents.
