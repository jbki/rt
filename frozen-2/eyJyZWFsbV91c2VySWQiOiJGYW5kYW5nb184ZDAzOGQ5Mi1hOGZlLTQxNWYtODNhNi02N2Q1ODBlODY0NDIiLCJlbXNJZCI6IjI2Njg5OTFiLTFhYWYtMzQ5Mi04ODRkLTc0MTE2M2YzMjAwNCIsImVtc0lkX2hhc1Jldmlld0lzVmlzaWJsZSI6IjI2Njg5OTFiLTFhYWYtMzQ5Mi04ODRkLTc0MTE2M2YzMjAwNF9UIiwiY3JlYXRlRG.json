I think the whole entertain parent mantra isn’t working anymore as a lot of the storyline goes over the heads of children. But it was visually beautiful and I love the incorporation of the native people.","displayName":"Alexis E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T00:41:46.159Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T00:41:46.159Z","user":{"userId":"AA768FCE-B645-493B-BD7C-5B15A82CC5C2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Alexis E","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Really enjoyed the movie.

I was so touched by one of Anna's songs. I even heard more than a few moms sniffling during that song and also laughing right along with me throughout the lighter moments of the movie. I greatly disliked Olaf in the first film, but his character in this sequel and his message for kids to not be scared of the things they don't understand have absolutely won me over. This is a beautiful and heartfelt film I would enjoy watching again.","displayName":"Tami H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T00:39:19.944Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T00:39:32.301Z","user":{"userId":"976991572","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tami H","accountLink":"/user/id/976991572"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely loved Frozen 2!!!!
