Remember, this is a Disney movie meant for children.  It explores adult themes in a way children can relate to.  So to all the critics who go in depth with criticisms about why it's not that great, the only true critic who matter of a movie like this is CHILDREN and all the children I know absolutely love it.  The child in me agrees!  \n\nFurthermore, I loved the songs.  If fact, there are more memorable songs out of this movie.  The last one only had 2 songs; \"Let it go\" and \"Do you want to build a snowman.\"  I would argue this one has at least 5 awesome songs, songs that only get better the more you listen to them.  Personally, my favorite song is \"Show Yourself\" rather than the feature song, \"Into the Unknown.\"  Idina Menzel's vocal performance on this song is even better than \"Let it go.\"  I hope \"Show Yourself\" is nominated for an Oscar.","displayName":"Sky G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T17:50:48.270Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T17:53:16.589Z","user":{"userId":"978405712","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sky G","accountLink":"/user/id/978405712"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Everyone come together .
