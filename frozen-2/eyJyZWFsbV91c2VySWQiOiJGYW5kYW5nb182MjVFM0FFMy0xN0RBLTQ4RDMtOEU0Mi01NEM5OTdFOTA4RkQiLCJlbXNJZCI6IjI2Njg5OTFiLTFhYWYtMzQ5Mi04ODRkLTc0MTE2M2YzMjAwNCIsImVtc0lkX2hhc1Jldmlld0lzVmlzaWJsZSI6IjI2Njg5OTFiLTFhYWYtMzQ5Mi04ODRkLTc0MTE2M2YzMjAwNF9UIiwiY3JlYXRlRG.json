So good! I loved the complex story line & characters. The songs were beautiful. Elsa complex strong through pain & tamed a wild frozen üêé horse surfing crazy waves & she even drowns to find the truth of her family lie. Good lessons for kids about how to stay grounded in such a complex & changing world. I definitely would watch this movie again. It's a perfect Thanksgiving family movie. Go see it. You'll be glad u did.
