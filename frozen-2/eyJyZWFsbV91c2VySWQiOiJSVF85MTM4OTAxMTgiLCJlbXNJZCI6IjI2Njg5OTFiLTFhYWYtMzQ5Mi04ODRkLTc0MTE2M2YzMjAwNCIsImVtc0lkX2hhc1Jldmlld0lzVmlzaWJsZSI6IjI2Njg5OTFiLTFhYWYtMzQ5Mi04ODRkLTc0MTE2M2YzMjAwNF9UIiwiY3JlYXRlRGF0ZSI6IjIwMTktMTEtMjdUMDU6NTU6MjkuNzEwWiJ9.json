I'm always concerned of the plot & everything. I understood that Elsa & along with her sister & friends on quest to discover to truth about her powers to an enchanted forest. I figured there are elements of the Earth. Olaf my favorite character sure was pretty funny in this & all the stuff he pulled throughout the plot. \"Into The Unknown\" is the song I like best of Idina Menzel. Good music & it is more fantasy than the 1st.

No matter how good it would end up being. With \"Frozen II,\" however, this notion doesn't even really come into play, for things don't particularly measure up to the standards of Disney animated films in general, let alone the standards of a sequel to one of their biggest and most rabidly worshipped successes. Nothing really happens. No one really learns anything they didn't already know in the first film. No one really changes, for better or worse. There aren't even any material consequences for the characters to deal with at the end of the film -- just logistical ones. The songs struggle mightily to find anything interesting to do within the key that they're written in, ultimately leaving next to none of the actual pieces of music at the level of memorability that some of the predecessor's songs sat at (\"Do You Want To Build A Snowman,\" \"Let It Go,\" etc.) It's not a botch job by any stretch, but it is a definite departure in quality from the 2013 hit (which I wasn't even crazy about to begin with).","displayName":"Robert R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1183085978/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T05:49:13.812Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T05:49:15.615Z","user":{"userId":"831846724","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert R","accountLink":"/user/id/831846724"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It‚Äôs a good kids movie.

This movie did not capture the imagination like Frozen did, but it was entertaining. My 17 year old son and I both thought there were too many songs in this movie, where my wife and 11 year old daughter thought there were not. I got \"wife-splained\" that this was a \"musical\". IMO Frozen was a movie with lots of music, not a musical......so we differ in opinions there as well. Regarding the music....nothing NEARLY as catchy as the first movie soundtrack either. I recall singing \"Love is an Open Door\", \"Summer\" and \"Do You Want to Build a Snowman\" continually in the car and at home with my kids. I do not think there will be a single song in this soundtrack with that kind of impact. Overall the movie was entertaining although I had the basic plot figured out before it happened....unlike the twist at the end of Frozen 1. Was it worth the money? Yes, it was a good family night out. However, I do not think this one will be remembered in ANY way like the first one.","displayName":"Keith","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T05:42:58.530Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T05:42:58.530Z","user":{"userId":"9176e399-73c0-45db-83f5-f390f4adba65","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Keith","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Really good!! it's just Awesome! elsa is really really beautiful!!
