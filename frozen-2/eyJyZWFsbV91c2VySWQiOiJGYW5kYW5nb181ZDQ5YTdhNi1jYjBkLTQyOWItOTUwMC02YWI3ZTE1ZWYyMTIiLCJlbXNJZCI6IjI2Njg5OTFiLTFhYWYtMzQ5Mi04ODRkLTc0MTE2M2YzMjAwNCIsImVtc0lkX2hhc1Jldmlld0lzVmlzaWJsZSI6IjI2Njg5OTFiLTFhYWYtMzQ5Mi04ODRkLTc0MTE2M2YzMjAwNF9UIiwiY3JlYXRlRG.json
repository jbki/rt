I just thought some of the songs were unnecessary or added at weird times during the movie.

While the music dominated the first movie the characters and story were the highlight of this one. A much more mature story telling. The music was very good but no single song really stood out, although the boy band music video style of Christoph's solo is definitely unforgettable. I laughed throughout that entire song.","displayName":"Steven F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T01:31:53.167Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T01:31:53.167Z","user":{"userId":"69a6dd8f-6276-44f0-93c2-6a5d7d457f2a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Steven F","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a perfect sequel to the first Frozen.
