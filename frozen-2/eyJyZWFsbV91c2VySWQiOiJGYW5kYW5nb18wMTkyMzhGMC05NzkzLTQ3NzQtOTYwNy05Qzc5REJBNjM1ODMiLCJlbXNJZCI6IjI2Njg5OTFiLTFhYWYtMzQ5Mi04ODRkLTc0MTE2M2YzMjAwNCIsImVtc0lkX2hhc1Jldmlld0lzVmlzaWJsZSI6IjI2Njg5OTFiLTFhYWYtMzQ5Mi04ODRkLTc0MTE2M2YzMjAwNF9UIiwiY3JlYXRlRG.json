Anna, Elsa, Kristoff, Olaf and Sven travel to an ancient enchanted forest in order to save their kingdom. A colorful adventure full of action sequences, delightful songs, a convincing character development and extremely amusing moments. The animation and the effects are breathtaking and it is guaranteed to have some nominations in the upcoming awards season. 'Into the Unknown' and 'Show Yourself' are my highlights!","displayName":"Johann M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10206416292986888/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T00:36:51.811Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T00:36:51.811Z","user":{"userId":"822101374","realm":"RT","displayName":"Johann M","accountLink":"/user/id/822101374"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"}]}
