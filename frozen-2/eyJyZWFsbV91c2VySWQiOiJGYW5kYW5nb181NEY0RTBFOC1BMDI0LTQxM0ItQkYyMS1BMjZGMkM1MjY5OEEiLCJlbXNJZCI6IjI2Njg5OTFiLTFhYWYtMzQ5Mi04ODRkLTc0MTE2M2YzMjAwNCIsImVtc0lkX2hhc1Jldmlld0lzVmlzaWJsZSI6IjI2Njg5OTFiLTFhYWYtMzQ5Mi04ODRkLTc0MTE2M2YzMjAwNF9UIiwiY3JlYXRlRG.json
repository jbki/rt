The story itself is simple and may be too simple and has some logic issue, however, it is too good on an emotional level. *Spoiler Alert* For instance, the first time I heard the song Show Yourself, I was a little disappointed. But when the song came out in the movie, I cried so hard. It's a mix of \"God, that's her mother singing\", \"God, it's always herself\", and \"Elsa finally gets to be herself!\"emotions. Elsa's feeling could be read and related to on many levels: Whether you have a sense of \"outsider\" or \"not belonging to here\", or you feel you are different (in many ways). \nI love other Characters too! (Not Hans) and I love how this movie doesn't have any big villain (one of the professional reviews hated this point, I don't see why)\nAnd I love the ending. Be true to yourself, Elsa is a free spirit and she sometimes needs some space, she doesn't need to be a Queen. :)","displayName":" ","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/522255181835699/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T18:02:41.755Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T18:02:48.521Z","user":{"userId":"978411091","realm":"RT","displayName":" ","accountLink":"/user/id/978411091"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Beginning was slow & boring but half-way through it got better","displayName":"Leigh","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T18:00:03.738Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T18:00:03.738Z","user":{"userId":"d49af8cd-7455-4746-b59b-c1cb596d065d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Leigh","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"i lovedddd it.  the new songs are AMAZING my kids loved it as well ❤❤❤","displayName":"Janice","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T17:59:54.042Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T17:59:54.042Z","user":{"userId":"B387EB27-5EA3-4502-BA6A-9D41AC72129B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Janice","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"There was a little too much singing this time, but I love this movie!!
