Without spoiling it for anyone who hasn't seen it Frozen II answers questions but also raises new questions. I only hope that the questions that are new can be answered in a 3rd Frozen Movie. The songs are all catchy and amazing, heres hoping for more adventures from Frozen.\n\nSPOILER ALERT:\nI think a lot of people also want to see the wedding and find out if their parents are 100% dead or alive as it only ever hints towards they might be dead but don't exactly confirm it and what happens to Elsa now that she is the protector of the forest, who is she protecting the forest from? Theres so many story lines for a 3rd as Hans could kidnap Anna to stop the wedding to Kristoff.","displayName":"Stacey R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10215530261911522/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T22:40:37.469Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T22:41:46.775Z","user":{"userId":"978418787","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stacey R","accountLink":"/user/id/978418787"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"}]}
