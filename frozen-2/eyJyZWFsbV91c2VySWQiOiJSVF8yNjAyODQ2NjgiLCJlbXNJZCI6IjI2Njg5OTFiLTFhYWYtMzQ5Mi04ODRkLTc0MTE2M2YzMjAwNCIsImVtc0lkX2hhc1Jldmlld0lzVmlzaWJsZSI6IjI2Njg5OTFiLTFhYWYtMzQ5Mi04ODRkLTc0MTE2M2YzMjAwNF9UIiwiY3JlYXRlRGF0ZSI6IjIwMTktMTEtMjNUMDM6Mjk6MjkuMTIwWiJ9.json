The songs were good but the quantity of songs felt excessive. I liked more of the songs in this film that the first film. It would go from one song to the next with few breaks. I liked the music score by Christphe Beck. I felt like there were more memorable songs in this film for me than the first film. This was one of the best films I have seen in 3-D in a very long time. Every shot was a visual spectacle. I did feel like the story was the weakest aspect to this film. It took a long time to lead up to and it was unconventional in its villain not being living but being an ancestor. This is a good standalone film. You did not have to see the first film to understand the second film. This is a post credit scene. It took too long to set up stuff in this film. There was not enough exposition some times to explain what was happening. The Autumn leaves looked impressive, snow flakes, snow powers, water powers. It was interesting how the the villain was something the grandfather set up by betraying native people. I liked the new fire lizard creature that reminds me of Pascal the chameleon in Tangled.
