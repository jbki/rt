I personally always liked the movie and enjoyed its classic Disney style. Like many animated sequels, \"Frozen II\" isn't quite as good as the first, but that doesn't mean there aren't things to like about it. I think the movie's greatest asset is the gorgeous animation. The whole thing is very visually appealing. I also thought the songs were solid, though I don't think any of them are quite as memorable as \"Let it Go\" was or even some of the other songs in the first. Despite beautiful animation and solid music, the movie struggles with its story. I liked the themes that were presented but there is a lack of focus on what the movie truly wants to be about. I also just wasn't as grabbed by the story as I was with the first. I think this movie is visually stunning and a decent conclusion for the characters, but because of its messy story, it isn't quite as fun or memorable as the first.","displayName":"Yash B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000592764041/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T23:09:51.911Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T23:09:51.911Z","user":{"userId":"915900746","realm":"RT","displayName":"Yash B","accountLink":"/user/id/915900746"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great story \na heartfelt family movie\nboth kids and adults enjoyed it.","displayName":"Leticia","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T23:07:42.151Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T23:07:42.151Z","user":{"userId":"1ABF1978-C8C2-462C-90A7-380F9B5F5744","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Leticia","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"}]}
