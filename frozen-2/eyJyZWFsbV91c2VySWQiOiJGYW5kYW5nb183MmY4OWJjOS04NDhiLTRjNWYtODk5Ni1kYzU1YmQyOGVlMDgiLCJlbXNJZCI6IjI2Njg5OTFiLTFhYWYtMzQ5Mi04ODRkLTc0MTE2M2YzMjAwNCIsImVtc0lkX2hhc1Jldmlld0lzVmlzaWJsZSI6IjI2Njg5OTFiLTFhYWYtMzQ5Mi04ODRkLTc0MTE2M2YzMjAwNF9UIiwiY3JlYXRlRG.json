Many of it did not make sense at all.\n\nThe whole demonizing of dams was unnecessary.  The movie completely glossed over the benefits of a dam and ignored the reasons why it was originally built.  The premise that a dam could kill crops due to lack of water might be plausible, but there was no evidence that it did.  Regardless, destroying the dam was pointless because they could have just modified the water-flow.\n\nThe fog was supposed to keep people in...but for some reason the girls parents escaped?  In the first movie, the parents had to seek out help to understand Elsa's condition, but in the second it said that the mother was a magical person who knew the whole time.  Anna had a white streak in her hair in the first movie, but not in the second.  The dam was supposed to destroy Arandale...but it didn't.  When Elsa pushed the water away, it never went anywhere else...it just kinda disappeared.  The voice calling Elsa was said to be her mother...who was still dead?  Then Elsa said that the person she was looking for was herself?\n\nThe movie kinda felt like they went out of their way to make a racist attack on white people in general, and successful white people specifically.  It is also pretty racist to always paint darker skinned people as magical earth people.\n\nThe movie also seemed to present men as useless...unless they were needed to step in and save the day.  After men saved the day, they were expected to just stand in the background and pretend like they were useless the entire time.  I get it that the movie is not meant for boys, but doesn't lying to girls about men being useless accessories just doom girls to grow up to be lonely feminist cat-ladies?  \n\nThe songs were ok, but not as good as the first.  The movie totally milked from the first movie and could not stand on its own if the first movie never existed.","displayName":"Andrew G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T05:10:16.471Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T05:10:16.471Z","user":{"userId":"da580a95-b51d-414c-a4c5-d9f2db358bc5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Andrew G","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I only thought it was ok compared to the original.
