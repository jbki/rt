Great music, great message, great performances. I can’t even imagine what it would have meant to me to see Disney movies with female characters like these - with skills and talents, leaders and problem solvers - instead of ones that give up their voice or freedom to have a man like them. It’s so inspiring and wonderful.","displayName":"Anna V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T06:20:26.495Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T06:20:26.495Z","user":{"userId":"AA1E06F7-7808-4836-92BC-D88DAF5033D7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Anna V","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"The storyline was great but they broke out into song every scene.

I am a man. I couldn't identify with anyone in this movie... My girlfriend was with me in the movie theater. That's the only reason why I stayed until the end.
