The most notable were the titles at the end.  We were disappointed by the movie.  Story was neither kid friendly or adult friendly.  Too many forgettable songs.

It had charm, humor, action, emotion, and an equally amazing soundtrack. It makes callbacks to the first without depending on it to much and develops the characters throughout the film. The spotlight is on Elsa way more than the first and seeing her powers and what she can do was breathtaking.","displayName":"Corey","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T14:14:38.414Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T14:14:38.414Z","user":{"userId":"ae8ad7b0-ea33-4ff9-b0ae-ca7fcb8aa12b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Corey","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The story, the gorgeous scenery, the soundtrack - it exceeded my expectations!","displayName":"Mary T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T14:13:24.067Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T14:13:24.067Z","user":{"userId":"df495b91-e862-43ce-b2b8-a685b4113156","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mary T","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"it was a great movie!

Elsa's powers seem weaker and the timing feels off.  Why are these events happening now?
