Overall, the movie was much more tolerable to watch than it's predecessor. However let's go over some concerns of people. It has been said of this movie that the music doesn't stand out, and the song are forgettable. This is true for a few of the songs, however for the majority of songs in the movie are still on the front of my mind a week after the movie. It has also been said that the movie cannot capture the showstopping feel of it's predecessor. Again, this is partially true. The movie is much more predictable, which takes away a lot of the feeling of astonishment. Despite this, the movie still manages to be absolutely showstopping at several points.","displayName":"Josiah A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T12:27:51.559Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T12:27:51.559Z","user":{"userId":"978419416","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josiah A","accountLink":"/user/id/978419416"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"}]}
