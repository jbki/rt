It was much less Disney movie, and more Broadway, with the songs being written into the story.  There are other issues as well, but a thorough review would take a lot of time.","displayName":"Chris","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T05:31:35.865Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T05:31:35.865Z","user":{"userId":"659A5800-615D-45AF-A286-4C6507B3015F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Chris","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Just do the next right thing when you're lost.
