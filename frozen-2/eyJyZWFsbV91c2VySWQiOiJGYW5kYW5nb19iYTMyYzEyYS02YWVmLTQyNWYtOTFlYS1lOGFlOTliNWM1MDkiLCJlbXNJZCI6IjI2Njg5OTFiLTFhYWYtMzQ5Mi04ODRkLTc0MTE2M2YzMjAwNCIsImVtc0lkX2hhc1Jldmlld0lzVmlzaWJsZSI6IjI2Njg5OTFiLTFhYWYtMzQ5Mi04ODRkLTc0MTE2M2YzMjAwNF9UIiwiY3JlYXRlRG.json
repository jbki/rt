I cant complain it was a damn good movie. It reminded me of a final fantasy video game. A bunch of useless friends and heroes except for the main character. And guess what they didnt shy away from the fact that it was the white man's fault. 8 outta 10 a solid DISNEY movie all around.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-22T18:44:42.841Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T18:44:42.841Z","user":{"userId":"969489189","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/969489189"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"omg.

It addresses more mature concepts and develops the characters through believable and emotional situations. The visuals are absolutely incredible and the music feels less childish than the first movie.

Disney took on a nearly impossible task trying to catch lightening in a bottle for a second time, and it didn't live up. The story is hard to follow and I found myself being annoyed by the same beloved characters from the first Frozen (for instance: Anna is obnoxious, Elsa is annoyingly drifty and ADD [\"Squirrel!\"], Kristoff seems dumb, etc). They tried to make too many self-referential lines to link to the first Frozen (believe me, people remember the first movie) and pushed a convoluted, unclear, esoteric message. PS - the songs weren't nearly as catchy or fun (I appreciated Kristoff's 80s love song, but I'm not sure it was needed?). Overall: Glad I saw it but I left feeling disappointed and scratching my head.","displayName":"Berry P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T14:29:00.774Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T14:29:03.324Z","user":{"userId":"978464945","realm":"RT","displayName":"Berry P","accountLink":"/user/id/978464945"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"}]}
