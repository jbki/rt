Elsa longs to find out what the secret voice that is calling her, but doesn't want to risk her family she fought to hard for in the first film. Yet she wants to know who she is and what her purpose in life is. This movie symbolizes the journey humans go on to find who they really are and letting go of stereotypes and expectations people may have of us. Elsa was meant to go beyond her kingdom and this shows us how she lets go of her fear and dives into her world.","displayName":"Amber P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1476930073/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T15:25:05.847Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T15:25:14.870Z","user":{"userId":"787312229","realm":"RT","displayName":"Amber P","accountLink":"/user/id/787312229"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A fun and enjoy experience!","displayName":"Pete","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T15:10:23.586Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T15:10:23.586Z","user":{"userId":"176704E0-6AA8-44D6-9B6E-80D47551AAA8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Pete","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Not as good as first one.
