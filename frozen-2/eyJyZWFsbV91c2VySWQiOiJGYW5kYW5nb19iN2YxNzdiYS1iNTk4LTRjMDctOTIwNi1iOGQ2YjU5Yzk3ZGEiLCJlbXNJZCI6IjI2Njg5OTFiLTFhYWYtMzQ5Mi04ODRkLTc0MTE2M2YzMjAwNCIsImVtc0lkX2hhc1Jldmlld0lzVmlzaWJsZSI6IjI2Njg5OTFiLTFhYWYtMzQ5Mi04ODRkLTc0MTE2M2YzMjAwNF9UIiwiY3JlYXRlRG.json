Almost every single Disney Movie sequel was produced by a different film studio (DisneyToon Studios) who gave us some terrible direct to video Disney Sequels such as Return of Jafar, Little Mermaid 2, and Fox and the Hound II. As of now only 4 Disney films have been given sequels made by Walt Disney Animation (Rescuers Down Under, Winnie the Pooh, Ralph Breaks the Internet, and Frozen II) Each Sequel is without a doubt better than the direct to video films, but as of right now This is the best of that bunch. Frozen II has a script and story that is much better than the first and actually gives heart and depth to a lot of our characters. Kristen Bell and the Wickedly Talented Idina Menzel give astounding vocal performances, and Josh Gad even made me cry. Though only time will tell how the songs fair to the public, I believe Frozen II is a sequel that could've been much worse, (and probably should have been) but it goes above and beyond and I don't think anyone will be Letting Go anytime soon.","displayName":"Price P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/729981657440332/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T18:44:40.710Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T18:44:44.950Z","user":{"userId":"978156659","realm":"RT","displayName":"Price P","accountLink":"/user/id/978156659"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"}]}
