Although the songs were more complex than in the first movie, they were not fun and I highly doubt any children will be singing any of them. What's worse, the entirety of the movie felt like a music video compilation. This is especially noted in Kristoff's song (hands down the worst one) which was jarring, unnecessary, and felt like it was forced in as an afterthought. I will say that I was impressed with the elevation, especially whenever it came to the water horse. All in all, the entire family was disappointed when we left.","displayName":"Leroy B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-13T04:32:44.780Z","updateDate":"2019-12-13T04:33:02.376Z","user":{"userId":"978243768","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leroy B","accountLink":"/user/id/978243768"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Frozen II certainly had high expectations as the sequel to Disney's 2014 juggernaut. Thankfully, it did not disappoint. As an arguably more mature film, Frozen II explores themes of relationship insecurities, growing up, facing the unknown, and finding ways out of hopeless situations. Most importantly, it reveals that often times you are the source of your own greatness. An excellent musical score coupled with a plotline about the untold history of Arendelle ties this film together, channeling its power into another Disney success.\n\n*Spoilers may follow in this section*\nInterestingly, Elsa's story in Frozen II is very similar to the 1997 film, The Fifth Element. In both films, a female character with extreme power is tasked with joining the elements to prevent catastrophe. Although the stories are incredibly different, it is exciting to see this idea portrayed in a fashion appropriate for children.","displayName":"Mandy S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002617450967/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-13T04:23:37.679Z","updateDate":"2019-12-13T04:23:46.124Z","user":{"userId":"973250586","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mandy S","accountLink":"/user/id/973250586"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved it, better then the first.
