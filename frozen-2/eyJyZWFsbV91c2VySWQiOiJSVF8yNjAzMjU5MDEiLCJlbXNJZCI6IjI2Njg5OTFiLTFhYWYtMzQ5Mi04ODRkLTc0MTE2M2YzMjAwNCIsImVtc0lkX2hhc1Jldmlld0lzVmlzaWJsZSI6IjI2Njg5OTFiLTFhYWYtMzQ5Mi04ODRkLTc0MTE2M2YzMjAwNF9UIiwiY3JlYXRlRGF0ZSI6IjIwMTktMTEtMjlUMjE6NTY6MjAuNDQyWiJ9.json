Rather, it seemed driven by the studio, which clamored to capitalize on the original's success.","displayName":"Mark C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T21:27:09.104Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T21:27:18.859Z","user":{"userId":"978376243","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark C","accountLink":"/user/id/978376243"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"}]}
