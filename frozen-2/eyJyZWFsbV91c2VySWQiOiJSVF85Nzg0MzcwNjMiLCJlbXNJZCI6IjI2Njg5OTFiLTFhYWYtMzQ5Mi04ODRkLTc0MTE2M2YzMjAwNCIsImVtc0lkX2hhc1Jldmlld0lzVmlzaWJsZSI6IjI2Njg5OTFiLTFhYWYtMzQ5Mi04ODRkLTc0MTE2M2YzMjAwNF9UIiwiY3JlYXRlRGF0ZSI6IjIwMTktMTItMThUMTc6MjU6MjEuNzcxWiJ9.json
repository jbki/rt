Me personalty I think that the movies plot was not that interesting and did not have me on the edge of my seat. The movie lacked a antagonist which wouldn't be that much of a problem if the plot was more interesting but sadly it wasn't. The good in the movie is that the jokes are used appropriately and wasn't over board. The main characters were also good throughout the movie in a way as none of them made the movie worse. This movie is great to see with your kid and they will most likely love it and say it's great. This movie is obviously made for kids and I say it's a good kids movie.","displayName":"Carter D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-18T16:02:12.764Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T16:02:14.850Z","user":{"userId":"978397192","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carter D","accountLink":"/user/id/978397192"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Incredible animation with catchy music and great voice work.","displayName":"Matthew M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-18T15:49:58.780Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T15:50:01.033Z","user":{"userId":"978250612","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew M","accountLink":"/user/id/978250612"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Pretty good.
