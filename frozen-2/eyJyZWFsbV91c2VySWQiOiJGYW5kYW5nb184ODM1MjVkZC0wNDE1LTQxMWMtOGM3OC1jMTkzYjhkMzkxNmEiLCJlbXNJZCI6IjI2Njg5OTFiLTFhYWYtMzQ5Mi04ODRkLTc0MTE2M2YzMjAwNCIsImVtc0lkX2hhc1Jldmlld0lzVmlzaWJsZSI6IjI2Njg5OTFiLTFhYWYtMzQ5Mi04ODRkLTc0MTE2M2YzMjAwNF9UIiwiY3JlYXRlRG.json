Good lessons, some are not immediately evident (like some questions should not be asked). On the \"meh\" side it's fairly obvious where the plot is going, and there's very little actual suspense. The biggest \"if\" is dealing with Kristof, whose character (and music) really shines.","displayName":"Steve B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T11:32:08.405Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T11:32:08.405Z","user":{"userId":"44b34926-6f0d-4056-a136-846507b870e2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Steve B","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great story and great music.","displayName":"Jay","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T11:31:28.723Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T11:31:28.723Z","user":{"userId":"0076036b-29bd-4dfe-bc55-5bc031896ad2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jay","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!!!
