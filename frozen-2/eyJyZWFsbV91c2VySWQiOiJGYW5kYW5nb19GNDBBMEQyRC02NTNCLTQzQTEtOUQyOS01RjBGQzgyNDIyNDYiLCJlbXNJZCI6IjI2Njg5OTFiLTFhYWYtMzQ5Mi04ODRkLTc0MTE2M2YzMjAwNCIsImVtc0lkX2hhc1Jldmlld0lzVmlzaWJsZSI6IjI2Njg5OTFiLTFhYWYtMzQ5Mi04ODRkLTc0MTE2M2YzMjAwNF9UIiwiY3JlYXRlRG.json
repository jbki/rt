While the story, dialogue, and tunes are lackluster; the animation is beautiful. Visually there are some magical moments. It’s a shame those moments lack life and heart. Olaf is still very funny and good and carries the film. On the bright side for parents, no child will endlessly sing any song from this film. Sadly, there is not a song catchy enough to want to sing along with. I’m afraid this film feels only slightly better than your average corporate mandated sequel that is released directly to DVD. Little kids will love it because they recognize the characters, but adults will recognize that three songs and fluff takes place before a story starts. They could have titled it Frozen: The search for lots of exposition.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T03:38:45.265Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T03:38:45.265Z","user":{"userId":"260013089","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260013089"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie well worth it......the kids loved it!!!!","displayName":"chris","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T03:34:43.041Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T03:34:43.041Z","user":{"userId":"8E786501-E868-4999-BE82-1EF3B3AE13FF","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"chris","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"fulfilling story superior overall soundtrack very cinematic and moving at times.","displayName":"Benjamin P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T03:25:37.452Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T03:25:37.452Z","user":{"userId":"6A3EE315-CAD9-42EB-A11F-CF33973B5653","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Benjamin P","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Not too crazy about the convenience fee.","displayName":"Alex","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T03:16:26.048Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T03:16:26.048Z","user":{"userId":"A935E7AD-8F52-402C-AD0E-09A1FA85410C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Alex","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"better songs than the first movie","displayName":"NicIvy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T03:14:56.631Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T03:14:56.631Z","user":{"userId":"62C28C6A-6A6A-41C5-9E78-D6B0441660F4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"NicIvy","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"My children loved the movie!
