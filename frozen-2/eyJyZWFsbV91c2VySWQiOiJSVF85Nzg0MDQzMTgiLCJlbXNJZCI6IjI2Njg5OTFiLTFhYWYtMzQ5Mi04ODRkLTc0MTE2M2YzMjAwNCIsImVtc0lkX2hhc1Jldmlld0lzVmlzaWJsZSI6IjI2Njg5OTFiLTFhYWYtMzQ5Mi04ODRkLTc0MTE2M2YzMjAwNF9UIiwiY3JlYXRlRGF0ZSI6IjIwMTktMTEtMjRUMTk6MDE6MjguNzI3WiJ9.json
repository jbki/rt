Rather than try to replicate the extraordinary repression and loneliness from the first movie, they wisely chose to forge ahead and cover new ground.\nIt is a bit ironic that the main song is titled \"Into The Unknown\" when the core characters are so familiar and no really major new ones get introduced. But the physical and emotional landscapes do get expanded on significantly.\nAs with the original, I like how certain key plot twists caught me by surprise yet felt authentic and satisfying in retrospect. That caliber of writing puts this fantasy franchise well above most others in my book.","displayName":"Jeff A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T18:53:27.193Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T19:22:53.409Z","user":{"userId":"954185443","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeff A","accountLink":"/user/id/954185443"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie and story line.
