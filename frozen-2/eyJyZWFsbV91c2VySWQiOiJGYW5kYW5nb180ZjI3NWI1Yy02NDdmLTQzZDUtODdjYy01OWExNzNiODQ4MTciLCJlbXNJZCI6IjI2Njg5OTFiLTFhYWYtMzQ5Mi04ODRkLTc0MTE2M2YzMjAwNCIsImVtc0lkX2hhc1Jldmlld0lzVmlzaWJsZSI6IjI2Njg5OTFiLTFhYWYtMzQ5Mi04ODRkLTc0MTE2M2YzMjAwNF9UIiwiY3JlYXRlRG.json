The production value is much better but the story is very bad. Characters don't develop and fall in the same loop over and over during the overly long run time (it felt like a 4 hour movie).","displayName":"Valarie M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T18:07:03.635Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T18:07:07.485Z","user":{"userId":"978494656","realm":"RT","displayName":"Valarie M","accountLink":"/user/id/978494656"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"wonderful music great story!","displayName":"Michelle","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T17:53:03.674Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T17:53:03.674Z","user":{"userId":"57eafa71-d08c-4478-8028-07ebfdee3be1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michelle","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"No plot to the movie","displayName":"Ron J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T16:37:48.515Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T16:37:57.902Z","user":{"userId":"978494544","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ron J","accountLink":"/user/id/978494544"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"3.5 Star Review: (No Spoilers here) Set about 3 years after the events of the first film, Frozen II brings audiences back to Arendelle where mysterious elemental forces of Earth, Air, Fire and Water attack the city under Elsa's rule. All the while, Elsa begins to hear a mysterious call from a far away land. While she initially does everything she can to block it out, she eventually succumbs to its power and sets out on an adventure to find out where its coming from and if it holds the key to saving the city from the elementals.\nAll the main characters and cast return for the sequel with Anna and Kristoff still playing their usual selves while in a committed relationship and Olaf philosophically (and comically) ponders his existence in the universe. Frozen II is a more mature film than the first and benefits from crisp pacing to advance the story forward and in a logical way. Elsa's character is perhaps the most fascinating as she seemingly completes her own story arc by fully accepting who she is and finding her place in the world. It's this journey of self discovery that successfully appeals to audiences as we all strive to find our own place in this world as well. The plot revolving around her character arc supports that growth even if it is sometimes predictable with recycled themes. Nonetheless, Frozen II serves as a solid sequel that is sure to be fun for the whole family. Beautiful animation, an excellent soundtrack and Elsa's character arc all contribute to make Frozen II an entertaining film that nicely continues the adventures of Elsa and her friends.","displayName":"Adrian D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1530878404/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-31T16:29:40.434Z","updateDate":"2019-12-31T16:30:04.313Z","user":{"userId":"905421310","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adrian D","accountLink":"/user/id/905421310"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great story line.
