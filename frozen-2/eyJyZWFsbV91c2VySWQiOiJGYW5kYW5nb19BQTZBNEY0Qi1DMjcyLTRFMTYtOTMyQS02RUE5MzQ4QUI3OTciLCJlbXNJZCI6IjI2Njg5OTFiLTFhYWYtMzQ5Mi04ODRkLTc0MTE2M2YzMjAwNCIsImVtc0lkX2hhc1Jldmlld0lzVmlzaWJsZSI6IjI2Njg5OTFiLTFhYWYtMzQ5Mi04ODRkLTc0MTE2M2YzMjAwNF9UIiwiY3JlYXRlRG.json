Apart from that, there is no memorable or noteworthy song in the movie. Sure, something will probably get some praise, like its predecessor in that awful let it go song that holds exactly zero candles to the amazing songs of Disney's classics from Little Mermaid, Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, etc. They are taking no risks anymore and everything feels so flat and predictable. Now, about the story itself - it hurts both itself and the first one. The parents' deaths having no meaning was one of the stronger points of the first one. That bad things happen. Nope, not anymore. Now they died on some ridiculous quest very poorly conveyed with water memory and some clear theft of the 5th element concept. As if the first one didn't lock Anna as the princess nobody cares about, the sequel only further locks in Elsa as the character all kids want to be and celebrate. Sure, give her the ability to run on water, a fancy water horse, new dress, and new kingdom. Anna gets... the shaft again. Except they're both queens now apparently. Hey whatever. It was never a Disney tale I cared for. Having seen the sequel only plummets this story into the depths of mediocrity for me. It would have been much better if Elsa actually died in her little sacrifice of zero sacrifices. Instead, let's just pile on the powers and make her completely unstoppable. Unless you consider her powers  successfully preventing me from being willing to see or hear any further on the Frozen world.","displayName":"Greg M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T19:25:16.605Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T19:25:27.622Z","user":{"userId":"977938066","realm":"RT","displayName":"Greg M","accountLink":"/user/id/977938066"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Not much of an hold your attention plot","displayName":"Deb","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T19:03:43.141Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T19:03:43.141Z","user":{"userId":"eaaef11c-37c4-4d3f-81a0-d85354ff6e2d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Deb","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My granbabes loved it.","displayName":"Deborah S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T18:58:59.565Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T18:58:59.565Z","user":{"userId":"4480acce-8afd-4ec5-a70e-f7d9ae540eff","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Deborah S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Different than the original, but very entertaining and enjoyable","displayName":"Eric M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T18:49:56.734Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T18:49:56.734Z","user":{"userId":"C2460AFE-749C-4182-AE4E-9A6BA790935F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Eric M","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Disney movie yet.

I personally think that the soundtrack is just as great too. The each character’s development is good. A lot of people are upset by how Anna was portrayed, but I think that as a whole if she didn’t go through the things that she did it would not of given her dimension. The difficulty she goes through is something that we all go through at one time in our life or another. For the sake that this is a movie she does not have a lot of time between scenes where she can just be helpless and deal with the issue, she mainly has to put her big girl panties on and “get over it” really quick. I think that it was written like that shows that we can continue to grieve for situations in our life and do what we have to, to be able to move on as well. The movie it’s self seems more adult than a children’s movie, but the humor was still there and I definitely see it again.","displayName":"Michelle","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T18:17:04.989Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T18:17:04.989Z","user":{"userId":"AB7E1F27-1788-43FE-9C99-2303C66A0790","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michelle","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"}]}
