I thought it was really original and cool how they circled it back to Frozen 1. And I am mainly here to let people know that this movie has it all and I think everyone can hold an appreciation for it. The music is catchy and fun, the aspect of sisterly love is refreshing and sweet, and I didn't find it cheesy, like some animated films can be. I saw another reviewer say that the movie was sad by quoting the song Anna sings entitled, \"The Next Right Thing,\" but I think this person gave some incorrect info by letting this one, sad song ruin the whole movie for them. If you watch the movie in its entirety, you will understand what this song actually means, so please take reviews with a grain of salt. I went on a tangent, I know, so if you made it this far, I really hope you will see it for yourself. It is worth the hour and a half or so. :)","displayName":"Kayla W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T01:39:10.709Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T01:39:15.683Z","user":{"userId":"978407499","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kayla W","accountLink":"/user/id/978407499"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie frozen 2 was magical","displayName":"sean","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T01:38:07.320Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T01:38:07.320Z","user":{"userId":"83927134-5F8D-41EF-8FD6-D8DDACBF2EFE","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"sean","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great story line and great songs!!!!","displayName":"Gilbert","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T01:36:27.440Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T01:36:27.440Z","user":{"userId":"6896D7BB-1CD6-4223-A61B-CDFDF1FB2563","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Gilbert","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Confusing plot and too many songs!!!!","displayName":"John W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T01:35:51.662Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T01:35:51.662Z","user":{"userId":"1827350e-3f1a-4a52-9b54-9833e7273e30","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"John W","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"everything was great","displayName":"Jordan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T01:34:54.225Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T01:34:54.225Z","user":{"userId":"5373C3BA-5035-4A64-A663-0EAD50F4472A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jordan","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"}]}
