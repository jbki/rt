However, I did not want a sequal, but since it is Disney, I saw it coming.\n\nThis movie suffers from a few things...\n\n1. WAY to many song.\n\n2. Kind of weird story arc.\n\n3. It is a kind of weird movie.\n\nThere are some redeeming qualities however...\n\n1. Jason Ritter (played Dipper in Gravity Falls)\n\n2. Pretty sweet animation\n\nThis movie was sort of a mess.","displayName":"Sawyer H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T06:24:45.393Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T06:24:48.459Z","user":{"userId":"978456809","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sawyer H","accountLink":"/user/id/978456809"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"The plot was silly.
