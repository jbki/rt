It's beautiful and colorful, but the story line was bad!  They stole the Earth Wind Water Fire idea from the movie \"The Last Airbender.\"  \nThe songs were not good and not uplifting or fun!  There will not be a fun sing a long to this soundtrack!  Kristof's song was just awful!  It was a flashback to the 1970's with double screens and weird angles!  One shot was of Kristof and the deer surrounding him, it looked just like the Queen ll album, SO STUPID!  That song should have been left out of the film!  It didn't have the same theme and was unusual and weird!   \nThe story is disjoined and random, there are too many details and too much they are trying to add and fit in! Too much saying \"Elsa!\" Too much Olaf! Too MUCH! \nNot a good film!  I loved the first film! I don't recommend wasting your time or money seeing this film.  Maybe when it comes out in DVD or streaming!","displayName":"Heidi  D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T19:59:37.231Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T20:03:53.133Z","user":{"userId":"975083016","realm":"RT","displayName":"Heidi  D","accountLink":"/user/id/975083016"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Frozen 2 delivered with stunning animation, hilarious comedy (Olaf was a standout) and great tunes. With all the pressure to top the original, it was no small feat to deliver a story that was as authentic, and epic in scope to please fans. Lots of symbolism woven in for the state of the world as well.  In this way it works on multiple levels for all ages. WELL DONE! The music was really memorable with many songs still stuck in my head.","displayName":"Ali W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10203839628493680/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T19:58:24.365Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T19:58:29.934Z","user":{"userId":"978402650","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ali W","accountLink":"/user/id/978402650"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"}]}
