The plot is kind of samey, with Elsa trying to find her place, coupled with another plot of what happened to their parents.  Kids love the movie, but you may end up leaving the theatre with more questions about the plot holes.","displayName":"Light h","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T04:00:12.389Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T04:00:19.885Z","user":{"userId":"900791835","realm":"RT","displayName":"Light h","accountLink":"/user/id/900791835"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Kids and I loved it!
