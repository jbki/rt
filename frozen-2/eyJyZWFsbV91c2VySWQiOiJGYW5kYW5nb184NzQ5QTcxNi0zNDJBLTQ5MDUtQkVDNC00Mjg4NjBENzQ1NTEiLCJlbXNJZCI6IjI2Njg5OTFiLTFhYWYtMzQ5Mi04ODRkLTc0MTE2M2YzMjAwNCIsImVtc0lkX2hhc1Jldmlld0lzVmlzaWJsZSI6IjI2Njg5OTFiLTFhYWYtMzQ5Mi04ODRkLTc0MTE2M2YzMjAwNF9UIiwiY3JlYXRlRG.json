Olaf was hilarious, Kristoff and Sven were classic and the Ying and Yang of Anna and Elsa kept the movie interesting throughout.

The story and characters develop even further as they face the truth of their family's past while also realizing what needs to happen for the future. Elsa's desire to be free, which began in the first film, continues as she comes to terms with who she is and what she truly wants for herself. Kristoff's song was great and reflects his fears and concerns while always seeming to be the third wheel amongst the sisters. This is a great story and I'm excited to see where it goes next!","displayName":"Candace H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1236308500/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T17:03:17.645Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T17:03:28.763Z","user":{"userId":"917293170","realm":"RT","displayName":"Candace H","accountLink":"/user/id/917293170"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome movie! A lot of sequels are just about some random adventure, but this one builds on the history of the family/lands, and the kids and I loved it.
