This could be because I don't expect people to be singing \"Into the Unknown\" as much as \"Let it Go\" but no I actually really enjoyed the music and I think it's because not just one song had a message but a couple of them did. Although, I will admit there are 2 songs that could have been cut out because they kind of just brought the film to a halt. The score, once again done by Christophe Beck, was even a tiny bit better in this movie. The animation in this film, in my opinion, surpasses that of the first. There were so many shots in this film that were just gorgeous to look at and I wanted to see more of them. As much as I'm praising there are somethings that still bugged me about this movie like inconsistences in the film that bugged me, one thing is even in the trailer. This movie definitely took what was good about the first movie and tried to make that same magic again and sometimes it worked like with the songs but in other, it didn't such as, with the plot twists. There are two \"plot twists\" if you can call them that because most people over the age of twelve can figure them out, in this movie and I get why we had them but at the same time they weren't as good as with Hans from the first. Once again, the voice cast in this is incredible from everybody and I love how they actually gave them character growth. In the end, Frozen 2 is a great family movie and a good follow up to the first. If you enjoyed the first one, you'll probably like this one. I give Frozen 2 a 8/10.","displayName":"Jessica  K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T01:41:05.510Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T01:41:10.590Z","user":{"userId":"974648796","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jessica  K","accountLink":"/user/id/974648796"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent movie that my kids really enjoyed.","displayName":"Robert","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T01:39:01.688Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T23:57:21.002Z","user":{"userId":"28D0AB13-94C1-443E-A2B9-A715F0EE060E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Robert","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"couldn't believe the sequel was better than the original, each of the main characters has a standout song which is amazing.
