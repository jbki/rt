I didn't care a whole lot for the sequel because of the uncomfortable closeness between sisters taking front and center over everything else, even pushing Christof to the side in favor of sisterly love. Olaf wasn't funny at all - all of his comedic moments reeked of desperation on Disney's part, and none of them were funny. I hope that their next Princess movie is original and has more effort and love put into it, instead of just feeling like a cash grab.","displayName":"Carl K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000916127780/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T19:50:25.809Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T19:50:30.262Z","user":{"userId":"906973733","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carl K","accountLink":"/user/id/906973733"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie has real deep meanings and it's both heart breaking and touching. Best Disney movie, cannot understand why such a low score from the critics. To me this one did far better than the first movie. Should be scoring at least a 95+!! I watched it twice in theatre and pre-ordered the BlueRay. If there is one thing that did not make it a 100% would be the Lost In the Wood Song, I get the joke that they wanted it to be an 80s KTV form but it just didnt fit in with all the other songs. My favourite 2 songs are Show Yourself and The Next Right Thing. I cried with these 2 because they are just too touching, revailing the familial love and courage that is beyond time and memories. I was both shocked and greatly thankful to be born in this time period to be able to grow with these movies together!
