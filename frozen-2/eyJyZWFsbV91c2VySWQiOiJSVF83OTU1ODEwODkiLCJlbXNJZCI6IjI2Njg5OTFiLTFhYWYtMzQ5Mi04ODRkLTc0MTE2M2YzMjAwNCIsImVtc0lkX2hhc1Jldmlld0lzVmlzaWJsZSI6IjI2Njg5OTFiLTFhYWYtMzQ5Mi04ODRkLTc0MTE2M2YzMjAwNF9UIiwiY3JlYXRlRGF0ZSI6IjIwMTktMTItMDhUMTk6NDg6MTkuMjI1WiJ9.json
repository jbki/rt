I missed the fun moments like the duets with Elsa and Anna, Anna and Hans, etc. and there were few laughs this time. There were several real downer moments trying to tug at the heart strings that didn’t quite work for me. I remember leaving the theater after seeing the first Frozen thinking “Wow! That was perfection, and something I have never seen before” with an upbeat and invigorated feeling, something uncommon when being dragged by my kids to yet another animated film. This film is still leaps and bounds better in CGI and sound than what I grew up on, but a lot of the older Disney fare (Beauty & the Beast, Little Mermaid, etc..) had more memorable characters and storylines. Overall, the kiddos will love it, and most parents will be amused by Frozen 2.
