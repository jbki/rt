I love how progressive Disney was with this movie's characters. With Elsa and Anna taking independent leading lady roles and Kristoff having the courage to express his emotions about love in a forest. It is such a good role model for kids. I love it! \n\nEnding was slightly disappointing because the build was too good. Nevertheless still highly enjoyable.","displayName":"Hermes P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T17:45:29.381Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T17:45:30.999Z","user":{"userId":"978393551","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hermes P","accountLink":"/user/id/978393551"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Frozen 2 had beautiful visuals it perfectly balanced, story lines and songs, with a good mixture of humor.
