Some of the effects harken back to Fantasia. The music is fabulous and the vocals by Bell and Menzel are some of their best performances. The script is terrific. but some of the jokes are way above the level of the many little costumed 5- or 6-year olds in attendance. Don't miss this, even if you don't have a little girl to bring with you.
