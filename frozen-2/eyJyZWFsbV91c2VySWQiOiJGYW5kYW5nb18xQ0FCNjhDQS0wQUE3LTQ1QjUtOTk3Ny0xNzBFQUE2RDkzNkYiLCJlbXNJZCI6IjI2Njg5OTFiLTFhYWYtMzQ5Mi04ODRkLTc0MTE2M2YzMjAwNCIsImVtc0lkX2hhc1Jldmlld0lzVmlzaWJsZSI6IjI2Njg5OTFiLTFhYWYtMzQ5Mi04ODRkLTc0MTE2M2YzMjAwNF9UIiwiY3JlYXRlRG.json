They could have cut that whole scene out. plus movie had a good mix of scary/gloomy and funny and this movie just seemed more gloomy instead of funny. Most of the songs were sad and not catchy at all. it wasn't terrible but I just had higher hopes since the first one was so great.","displayName":"Alishia","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T21:33:58.489Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T21:33:58.489Z","user":{"userId":"7F8B4C10-9F9E-429C-A218-8CBDE586BEFC","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Alishia","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"An excellent sequel to Frozen!
