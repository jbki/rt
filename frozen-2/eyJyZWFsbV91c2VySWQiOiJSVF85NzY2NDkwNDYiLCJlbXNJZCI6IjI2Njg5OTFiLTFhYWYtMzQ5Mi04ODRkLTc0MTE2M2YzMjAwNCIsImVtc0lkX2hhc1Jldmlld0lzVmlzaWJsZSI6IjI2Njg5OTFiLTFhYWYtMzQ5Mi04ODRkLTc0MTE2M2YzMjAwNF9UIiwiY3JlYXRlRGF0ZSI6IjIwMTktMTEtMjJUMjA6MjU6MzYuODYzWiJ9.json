I feel that critics and reviewers on YouTube really underrated this film badly. It had great drama, The bond between the sisters is more stronger then the first film, the world building is interesting, the plot could be more better but this didn't ruin the experience for me and the songs and animation is epic.","displayName":"Tony C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3160887617317276/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T20:19:08.845Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T00:31:41.656Z","user":{"userId":"978401056","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tony C","accountLink":"/user/id/978401056"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I like the movie and worked well in some degree. The story, itself is a bit confusing and having to example to my daughter some of the plot points was a bit challenging.  Also, the ending was a bit lackluster as I was hoping for some big throw down. Regardless, Lost in the Woods is my favorite song and it was a good movie. Don't think it will live up to the hype as the first movie, but as a testimony to continue to make great movies.","displayName":"Allen M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/528761534/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T20:18:50.685Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T20:18:55.553Z","user":{"userId":"884368614","realm":"RT","displayName":"Allen M","accountLink":"/user/id/884368614"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Such a beautiful story line.","displayName":"Rachelle","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T20:18:43.902Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T20:18:43.902Z","user":{"userId":"d4f0be87-4f41-41f4-9c28-f71444e7ac9b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rachelle","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Was good for being a sequel little sad but was overall a must see if you loved the first one.","displayName":"Gabriel Casas C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T20:18:14.370Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T20:18:14.370Z","user":{"userId":"C1774BE2-F6ED-41A0-98D8-84765D065A8A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Gabriel Casas C","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"If you are a Disney fan, a Frozen fan, or both this is a must see.
