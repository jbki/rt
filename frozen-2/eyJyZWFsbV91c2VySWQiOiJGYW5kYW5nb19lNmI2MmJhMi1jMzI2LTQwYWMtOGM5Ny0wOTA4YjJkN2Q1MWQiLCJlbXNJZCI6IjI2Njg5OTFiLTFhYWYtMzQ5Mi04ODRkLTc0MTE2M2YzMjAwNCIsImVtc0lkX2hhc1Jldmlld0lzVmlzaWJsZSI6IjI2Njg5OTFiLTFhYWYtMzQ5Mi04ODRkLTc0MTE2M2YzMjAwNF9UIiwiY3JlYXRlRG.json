The story also has obvious flaws that are quite big if you start questioning it. There is also no surprise in the devellopement as the clues are laid out to obviously. A spoiler-free exemple: \" Olaf, people die if they jump down a cliff. Nobody should do that.\" Well guess what happen later in the movie? Yeah... it's that obvious. And Kristoff song made me cringe and want to leave. Overral, me and my gf didn't have the best of times. But then again, its harmless and Im not the target demographic of such movies.","displayName":"Philippe C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10159434516751164/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T11:58:31.484Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T11:58:38.955Z","user":{"userId":"978406701","realm":"RT","displayName":"Philippe C","accountLink":"/user/id/978406701"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved it as well as my 7 year old and 5 year old and the humor was on their level as well.
