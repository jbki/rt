People who dismiss this film as just another corporate-mandated sequel cash-in are going to miss out on something very special, just like those who wrote off Blade Runner 2049 or (many Moons ago) The Empire Strikes Back. If you enjoyed Frozen and haven't seen this sequel, you're effectively missing out on half of a great story.","displayName":"Cas A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T00:37:07.987Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T00:40:19.853Z","user":{"userId":"978431669","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cas A","accountLink":"/user/id/978431669"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It is sentimental...
