Whilst the original film was full of flaws, its memorable characters, timeless but relevant story, big themes and brilliant songs ensured that it captured the imaginations of millions of viewers all over the globe. Was Frozen II able to replicate the magic of the film whose success was a happy accident? Well, Yes and No. The story is a bit of a mess, but the characters, visuals and songs remain strong and the big important themes ensure that it enjoys a substantial fraction of the original's resonance.\"\n\nFor my full review, click here...\n\nhttps://fairytalefanboy.blogspot.com/2019/12/frozen-ii-review.html","displayName":"FairyTale F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-14T22:18:30.428Z","updateDate":"2019-12-14T22:18:30.428Z","user":{"userId":"978431471","realm":"RT","displayName":"FairyTale F","accountLink":"/user/id/978431471"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Love love it :) my whole family enjoy it so much :)","displayName":"chad","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-14T22:13:21.541Z","updateDate":"2019-12-14T22:14:35.495Z","user":{"userId":"1191E926-C989-4521-83CF-CA24361E2D2F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"chad","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great story, full of emotion and memorable songs.","displayName":"Michael","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-14T22:02:38.125Z","updateDate":"2019-12-14T22:02:38.125Z","user":{"userId":"4FEAC7BC-CE2A-4075-B1B4-1E793443ACA5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved this movie!
