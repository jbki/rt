Since its release, it has broken records, even overcoming the \"Hunger Games\" for the most ticket sales in the Thanksgiving Week. \n\nThe Film is absolutely beautiful, enveloped in immersive music and vivid animations. Personally, I believe that the animations in this sequel is much more picturesque than in the first, and the psychedelic colours provide you with a breathtaking experience that you will not forget. The execution of scenes in the film are sensational, and even though they are just animations, it allows you to empathise with the people there, resulting in a much more enjoyable watch. In theatres, you can feel the grief and sorrow of the characters and especially the desperation of Elsa. They did an excellent job here. \n\nIn addition to this, it has a stunning storyline. It follows the tale of the much loved group of friends. We get a feel that Elsa does not feel like she belongs in Arendelle, and emphasises on Elsa's growing confidence, self belief and self worth as she finds more clues about who she is. It also focuses on Anna on how she overcomes her sadness, and grows into a character that is stronger mentally, which allows her to grow enough confidence to do the \"next right thing\". This is an extremely great motif for 2019, which tackles many major problems such as fighting for girl empowerment and helping young people believe in who they are. Another motif that Frozen II focuses on is memories. The overall theme of Frozen is that you have to acknowledge the sins of the past to undo the damage they've done, but dwelling too far in the past will leave you stuck in. \n\nThe movie is set 3 years after the masterpiece of Frozen 1, and in the beginning of the movie, we are given a song of how some things never change, but throughout the play we can see the world metamorphose, and the increasing maturity of the characters. The play tackles many motifs perfectly, however, I believe that Frozen II's audience is intended for much more older generations than it's predecessor, with many motifs found in the film to be hard to understand for younger children, and therefore less fun for a family day out.","displayName":"Animex C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T11:53:50.069Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T12:03:22.864Z","user":{"userId":"978414028","realm":"RT","displayName":"Animex C","accountLink":"/user/id/978414028"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Animation was gorgeous, story was ridiculous.\nVery disappointing.","displayName":"Kristy S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T11:50:44.765Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T11:50:44.765Z","user":{"userId":"b9e3ad1d-6160-4e89-be53-3de3d13ed85e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kristy S","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Visually beautiful!
