While some songs where good, it felt like they were trying to hit another bullseye like they did with \"Let it Go\". \n\nDespite the songs taking over the film, I liked this sequel and hope that if there ever is a third film; they can figure out how to make another good story accompanied with just the right amount of songs. The score on the other hand, was something I enjoyed too.","displayName":"Hap L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T10:34:08.287Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T10:34:14.068Z","user":{"userId":"978447485","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hap L","accountLink":"/user/id/978447485"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Ok, far weaker than Frozen I but the songs are so captivating.  The plot is mild and dull, I was really expecting a villain for the sisters to face against and in the end they split up, Elsa essentially became what Anna was and in order to free her, Anna has to break a dam, literally the dam is the villain of this movie.  I would say Grandfather since he built it, but he passed away a longgggggg time ago so literally the wall was the issue.  So like if the wall was the issue this whole time, why didn't the spirit call and sing to her more regularly, why wait until shes in control of her magic?  Bit too convenient.  Also, when you have things to lose or you sacrifice something for the greater good, that sends a message that everything has a cost.  Their kingdoms cost was the dam, but now that its destroyed, the kingdom should have been destroyed and they can always rebuild, but nope, Elsa swoops in and saves the kingdom like wtf LOL","displayName":"Tri N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/554095790/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T10:15:45.468Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T10:15:47.521Z","user":{"userId":"795081187","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tri N","accountLink":"/user/id/795081187"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"A great musical video with very poor plot.","displayName":"Martin C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T09:35:27.113Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T09:35:30.220Z","user":{"userId":"977160925","realm":"RT","displayName":"Martin C","accountLink":"/user/id/977160925"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Frozen 2 was a spectacular adventurous and thrilling sequel to the hit 2013 Oscar winning blockbuster!
