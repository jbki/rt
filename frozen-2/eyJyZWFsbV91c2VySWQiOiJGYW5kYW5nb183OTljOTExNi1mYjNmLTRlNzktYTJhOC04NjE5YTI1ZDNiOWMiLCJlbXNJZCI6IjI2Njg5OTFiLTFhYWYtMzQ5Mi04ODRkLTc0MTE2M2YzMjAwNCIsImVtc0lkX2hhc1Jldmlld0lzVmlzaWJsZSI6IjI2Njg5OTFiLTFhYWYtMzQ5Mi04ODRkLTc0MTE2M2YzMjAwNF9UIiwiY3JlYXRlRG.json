This story was very different from the first, but very memorable. Two great songs have stuck with me including the whisper! My 4 year old daughter has continuously decided to play pretend Elsa and sing her memorable song, Into the Unknown! It was dark but beautiful in its simplistic way and Disney has touched the hearts yet again and relate to those children or others who have lost someone so close to them or go through confusing periods of what love and explored what growing apart could feel like. All in all, the touched some deep feelings and it was absolutely beautiful!","displayName":"Haley","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T04:11:09.327Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T04:14:40.434Z","user":{"userId":"46e64185-dd30-404f-b9ed-9f81d5116d1d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Haley","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"We love it.
