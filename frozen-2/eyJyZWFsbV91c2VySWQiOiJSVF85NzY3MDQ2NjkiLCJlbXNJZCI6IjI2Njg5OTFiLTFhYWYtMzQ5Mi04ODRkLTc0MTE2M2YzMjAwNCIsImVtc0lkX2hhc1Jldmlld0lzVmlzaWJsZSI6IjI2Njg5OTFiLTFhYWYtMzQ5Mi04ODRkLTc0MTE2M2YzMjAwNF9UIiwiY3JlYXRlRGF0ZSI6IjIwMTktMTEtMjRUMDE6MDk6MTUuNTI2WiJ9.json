It instead trys a fantasy/Nordic adventure approach that is more than welcome. As soon as the plot starts rolling, it's a great time full of laughs and spectacle. Be warned, there are some pretty dark themes, especially in the third act that might shock viewers, especially kids. In addition, the soundtrack is much better than the first with the exception of Let it Go still taking the reigns as best Frozen song.","displayName":"Geoffrey J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10208315302958740/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T01:06:55.511Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T01:07:04.236Z","user":{"userId":"976946637","realm":"RT","displayName":"Geoffrey J","accountLink":"/user/id/976946637"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The songs sucked and the movie lacked a plot or real story line!
