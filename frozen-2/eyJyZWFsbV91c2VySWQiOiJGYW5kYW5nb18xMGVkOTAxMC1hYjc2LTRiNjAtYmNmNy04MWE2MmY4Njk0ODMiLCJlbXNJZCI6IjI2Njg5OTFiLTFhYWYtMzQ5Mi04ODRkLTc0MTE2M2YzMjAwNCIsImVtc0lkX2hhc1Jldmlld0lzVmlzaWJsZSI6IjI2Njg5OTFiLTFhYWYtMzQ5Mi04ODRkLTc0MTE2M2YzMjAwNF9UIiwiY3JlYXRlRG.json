The plot was confusing, the music was misplaced for the most part, and it seemed to be trying to mimic the first movie while still keeping its originality. Not a good mixture. The songs were not as catchy either. Often times the problem with sequels is they take a special trait that the main character possesses in the first movie and create a world in which the trait is no longer as special in the sequel. This movie is sadly not an exception to this. The animation, however, is well done, and the quality of the singing itself is amazing.","displayName":"Jordan V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T04:41:02.940Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T04:41:02.940Z","user":{"userId":"978411870","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jordan V","accountLink":"/user/id/978411870"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Frozen 2 begins with a spark, and we all believed that spark would start a fire, but the truth is that Frozen 2 barely has enough material to make a storyline, and you are left with a disappointing film, one that could've been dazzling. If Olaf had not been carefully crafted into the film, with his witty humor and charming personality, this movie would've been a complete failure, but thanks to certain moments with this certain snowman, the film manages to entertain the little ones, even if Frozen 2 never comes close to its predecessors glory.","displayName":"Rodrigo F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T04:37:08.659Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T04:37:27.223Z","user":{"userId":"978386763","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rodrigo F","accountLink":"/user/id/978386763"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a great movie for both adults and kids.","displayName":"movie viewer.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T04:35:48.451Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T04:35:48.451Z","user":{"userId":"CD1E1F4C-FB48-4496-A4CF-4D966A94D6F2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"movie viewer.","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Even better than the first one!
