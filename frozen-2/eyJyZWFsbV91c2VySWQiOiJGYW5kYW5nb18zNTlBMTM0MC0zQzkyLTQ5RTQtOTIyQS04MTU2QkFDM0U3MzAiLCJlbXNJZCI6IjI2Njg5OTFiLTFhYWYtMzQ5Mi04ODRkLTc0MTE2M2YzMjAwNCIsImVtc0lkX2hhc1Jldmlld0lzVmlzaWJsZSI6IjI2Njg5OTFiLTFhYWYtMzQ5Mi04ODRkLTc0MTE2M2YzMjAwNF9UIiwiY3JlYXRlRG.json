I kind of thought there was going to be more actively involved, to say the least?  The trailers made this movie look more action like than a regular Disney film.  The real problem is the characters. Kristoff was so not included in this film and even though I like Jonathon Groff (as King George III in Hamilton) Kristoff's little proposal plan was useless and a bit annoying.  He wouldn't be in the film and the movie will probably stay the same.  That reindeer guy and Kristoff had more chemistry than Anna and Kristoff.  Anna was annoying also.  Yes, she's clumsy and naive but her overthinking when Krisstoff said something was annoying.  Olaf was Olaf.  Funny at times.  Elsa. Many people that Elsa would get a girlfriend in this film.  Spoiler alert she didn't Disney doesn't have the balls to do that.  I thought it was going to be that one tribe girl. Like the other film, Elsa was being a bit selfish too. She just likes to cast others out I guess.  The songs were okay, but I hoped Anna had a little song other than the Depression one.  I mean- For the First Time in Forever was a good song.  It showed her voice well.  Why couldn't they make a song for her like that? We will never know.  Anyways, the Queen reference was amazing.  The only thing truly entertaining was my friend next to me.  And the fact that my other friend invited 10 other people.  That was- interesting.","displayName":"Brianna M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-01T20:39:03.793Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T20:39:08.238Z","user":{"userId":"978414624","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brianna M","accountLink":"/user/id/978414624"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Frozen 2 was great, kept me and the kids entertained.","displayName":"Daniel23","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T20:34:14.732Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T20:34:14.732Z","user":{"userId":"D92D38EB-62A4-4C86-98DD-036998555DD4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Daniel23","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Really good movie that does a really good job expanding the Frozen universe.
