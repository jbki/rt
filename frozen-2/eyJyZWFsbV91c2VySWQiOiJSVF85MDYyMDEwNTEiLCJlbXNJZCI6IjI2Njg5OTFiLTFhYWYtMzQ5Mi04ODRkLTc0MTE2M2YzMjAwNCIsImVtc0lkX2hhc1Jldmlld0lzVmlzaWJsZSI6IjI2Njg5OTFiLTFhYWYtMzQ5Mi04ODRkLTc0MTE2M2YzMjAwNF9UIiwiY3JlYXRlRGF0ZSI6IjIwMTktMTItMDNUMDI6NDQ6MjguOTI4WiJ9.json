Huge disappointment, especially with the bar set high from the first film. A real snoozer of a film. Literally I started dozing off shortly into the film. Sadly they tried in vain to capture a meaningful and catchy tune to no avail. Pass on seeing.

I'm also not a huge fan of a lot of the story choices and much of the humor didn't work for me. That being said the animation is gorgeous, the songs and music are great, and the characters are still enjoyable. Anna and Elsa still have a great relationship together and I liked their interactions. 6/10","displayName":"Parker F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T02:00:59.679Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T02:29:12.122Z","user":{"userId":"978306708","realm":"RT","displayName":"Parker F","accountLink":"/user/id/978306708"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I don't know if it reaches the high points of the original but Frozen II is a consistently great movie.
