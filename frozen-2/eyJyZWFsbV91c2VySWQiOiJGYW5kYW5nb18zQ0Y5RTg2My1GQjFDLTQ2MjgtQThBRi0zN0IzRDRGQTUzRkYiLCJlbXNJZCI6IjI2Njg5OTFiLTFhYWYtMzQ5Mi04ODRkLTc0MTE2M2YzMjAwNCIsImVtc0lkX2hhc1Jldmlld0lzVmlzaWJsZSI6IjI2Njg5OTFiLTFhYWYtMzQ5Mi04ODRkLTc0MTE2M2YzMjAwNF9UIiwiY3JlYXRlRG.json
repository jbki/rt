It was happy and sad at the same time but other then that I've been wanting to watch it over and over and over again. I love the music that was in it, it gives little details on what's about to happen next and where it can be at. Some of you may be thinking how do you know what's going to happen, the answer is you have to read between the lines, in other words think ahead and try to figure out what is gonna happen either it's gonna be good or bad.","displayName":"Queen","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T20:06:56.183Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T20:06:56.183Z","user":{"userId":"6789fc89-00fa-4c5e-8bcc-7e010b7be4ec","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Queen","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Confusing plot at times that contradicts a lot of the character development from the first one, but the animation and music was solid.","displayName":"Peter W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T20:03:30.413Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T20:03:30.413Z","user":{"userId":"CB25C985-5093-4117-BFFD-C9B5A80C8DF4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Peter W","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Magical!
