The songs that were fantastic literally made me cry but the other songs felt like filler songs and I was sort of waiting for them to end. Both Anna and Elsa have great stories and growth throughout the film. Would definitely watch again many times.","displayName":"Leah G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000362861082/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T14:23:16.207Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T14:23:26.467Z","user":{"userId":"910771378","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leah G","accountLink":"/user/id/910771378"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I loved that scenery","displayName":"nancy k","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T14:18:44.941Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T14:18:44.941Z","user":{"userId":"77130194-cbff-4b07-bc1a-ae881b27e957","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"nancy k","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great message about preserving and love","displayName":"Barbara","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T14:17:50.519Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T14:17:50.519Z","user":{"userId":"8e582f8f-e073-4488-b2d2-5e2b5ff49187","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Barbara","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Very good movie for the family","displayName":"oscar c","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T14:12:40.331Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T14:12:40.331Z","user":{"userId":"57fd4c9a-0851-4840-8361-ade978ce51bf","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"oscar c","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The storyline for Frozen 2 was amazing and just as good, if not better, than the first Frozen.  Both Elsa and Anna are more confident in this movie given that Elsa has had ample time to figure out her powers, and it's great to see how loving her kingdom is toward her.  However, the songs in this movie are more about deep emotions and are less \"fun\" than the first movie.  There's probably only one song (that Elsa sings) that could truly come close to the \"Let It Go\" song from the first movie and that may be a stretch as well.  Christophe has a stand alone song that left me thinking how did this guy ever grow up on his own. Essentially, take out all of the songs from this movie, and it would be perfect.","displayName":"Rachel T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T14:00:10.313Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T14:00:10.313Z","user":{"userId":"be5f0c91-a8b0-4d55-9452-e26530fa2fa8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rachel T","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Was better than the first one","displayName":"Enrique J Rosales Villarr","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T14:00:02.939Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T14:00:02.939Z","user":{"userId":"FCAD3888-4295-4264-943A-AA48CDC7DCBB","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Enrique J Rosales Villarr","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Top 3 of year.

Story is okay and music is decent.  Simply put there is no way to duplicate the “originalness” but as sequels to kids movies go this was one of the better.  My daughter enjoyed but didn’t walk out singing the songs like last time and biggest thing she talked about was a trailer for another movie before this one started.","displayName":"Facebook U","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T13:43:52.697Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T03:01:06.262Z","user":{"userId":"51B7C2CA-32A4-4A6C-9D23-DA523B246A7E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Facebook U","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"I seriously do not understand the ratings this disappointment is getting.
