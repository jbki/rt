The movie was visually beautiful but the rest of the movie was a disaster!  An overwrought and convuluted plot line that's so bad Olaf's recap of the original movie is one of the best scenes in the whole movie.  And the music sucks!  I defy you to find any little kid singing ANYTHING from this dud like they did with \"Let It Go\".  The song writers seemed to be too obsessed with advancing the sketchy plot line then writing actual lyrics.  And my grandchildren actually laughed out loud during Kristoff's \"big number\".  If you have kids who are clamouring to see this, my advice is wait until it released on video this spring.  They're not missing amything.","displayName":"Patrice","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T01:13:46.511Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T01:13:47.453Z","user":{"userId":"c4063988-f5ff-49bb-ab07-edbb300ffbf1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Patrice","accountLink":null},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Cute movie.

The music is quite good but there is no Let It Go, still the lyrics are powerful.  The songs are more adult in nature.
