Lots going on though and I'm pretty sure my kids (3 and 5) had absolutely no idea what was going on from start to finish. \n\nAs a mum I cried several times. Lots of referencing to their mother and being that she is dead and they miss her, I cried a lot!! \n\nKristoff has a song! Was a bit odd if I'm honest and out of keeping with Disney songs. More like REO speedwagon wrote it in the late 80's era of power love ballads written by rock bands! It was funny though.\n\nIt felt more like a musical production than an animation for children and as a musics family, I found it something my own mother wouldn't mind watching. It was very different to Frozen I'd say.\n\nI had to explain a few things to my 5 year old for her to understand it. The way it kept switching from the past to present and the explanation of why things were happening or had happened in the past could easily be lost on little children. Frozen was a lot easier to follow. Girl born with powers, can't control it, hurts her sister, saves her with love - that's it. With Frozen ll there is a heck of a lot more than that to understand.\n\nAll my 5 year old took from it was ‘Elsa's mum saved Elsas dad and Elsa nearly drowned but the horse saved her' that's it! \n\nI'm not sure I like the way Disney is going at the moment. Toy story 4 was a shambles and freaky!! \n\nIf they are going to make films for adults then there should be a divide somewhere. I loved it as an adult who loved the first movie. But not sure it's for little kids which is a shame because they are the fans!","displayName":"Jemma P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1032510503754583/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T18:02:45.109Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T18:02:54.687Z","user":{"userId":"978402483","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jemma P","accountLink":"/user/id/978402483"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It was ok, sound track is not as catchy with the tunes, a lot of comical moments.","displayName":"Erin","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T18:01:18.824Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T18:01:18.824Z","user":{"userId":"F9096C88-45E9-49CF-B26D-5E8870A7E7C8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Erin","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Loved it!

It's still enjoyable and the animation is gorgeous, but the plot was a little all over the place and seemed to graze over darker plot points without really doing anything with them. I also had a problem with the lack of a true villain like Hans who I really enjoyed last movie. I still recommend though, as it is not boring and actually quite funny too!","displayName":"Juliette A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T17:58:49.847Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T17:58:55.449Z","user":{"userId":"977826542","realm":"RT","displayName":"Juliette A","accountLink":"/user/id/977826542"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Frozen II is a really good sequel that has grown up with its audience.  There are plenty of songs like the first movie, but maybe not as memorable.  The \"Let It Go\" song this time is called \"Into the Unknown\", which is also sung by Elsa (but late in the film).  It won't be as big of a hit fortunately for us parents.  Both my daughters (10 and 6 years old) loved it and prefer this movie over watching the first one.  If you liked the first movie, then you won't be disappointed with this better-late-than-never sequel.","displayName":"David C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T17:58:07.276Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T17:58:17.784Z","user":{"userId":"961537161","realm":"RT","displayName":"David C","accountLink":"/user/id/961537161"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie does a great job at keeping up with it's audience who watched the first frozen movie!
