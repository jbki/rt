The score is very refreshing and the characters have grown with the story. It is definitely a more entertaining watch for adults. It has a more serious note than the first one, but I think it helps children build their emotional intelligence. \n\nDefinitely a MUST SEE!

Does not hold a candle to the first one. The whole thing seemed forced to me. I hate to admit it but I fell asleep a couple of times.  Im VERY surprised at all of the positive reviews.  People talk about it being visually beautiful.  I go see a movie for the story it tells, not the scenery. If its beautiful too, then thats a bonus. The music was so slow!  Nothing I could see myself singing along to. I still get tears welling up to this day when I hear Let it go (which is slow but also powerful!). I kept waiting to hear a song like that.  Never happened. I give it 3 stars because my kids liked it.  The bright spot was Olaf who was still as charming as ever.","displayName":"Kristen","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T10:30:25.094Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T10:30:25.094Z","user":{"userId":"147f82b0-2920-42d3-adc0-f45dfef4baaf","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kristen","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"}]}
