I also prefer the song Anna sings in the cave to “Into the Unknown”. I will say both my 8 and 10 year old kiddos sat through the whole movie. No bathroom breaks, no requests for more snacks, just pure joy.","displayName":"Melissa T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-09T03:44:24.720Z","updateDate":"2019-12-09T03:44:24.720Z","user":{"userId":"577DA861-8417-4B76-9FAC-E86A9ED01728","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Melissa T","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Kids loved it.

I wish certain things had been explained a little better, but I loved the dive into the lore of the movie's magic. Anna also had an expanded role which showed off the strength of her character, the love between the two sisters is still strong and potent as ever, and the endgames for the characters were logical and satisfying (without going the trendy edgy route of separating the two of them completely). Very good movie.","displayName":"Maria K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-09T03:03:35.572Z","updateDate":"2019-12-09T03:03:35.572Z","user":{"userId":"977413436","realm":"RT","displayName":"Maria K","accountLink":"/user/id/977413436"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 09, 2019"}]}
