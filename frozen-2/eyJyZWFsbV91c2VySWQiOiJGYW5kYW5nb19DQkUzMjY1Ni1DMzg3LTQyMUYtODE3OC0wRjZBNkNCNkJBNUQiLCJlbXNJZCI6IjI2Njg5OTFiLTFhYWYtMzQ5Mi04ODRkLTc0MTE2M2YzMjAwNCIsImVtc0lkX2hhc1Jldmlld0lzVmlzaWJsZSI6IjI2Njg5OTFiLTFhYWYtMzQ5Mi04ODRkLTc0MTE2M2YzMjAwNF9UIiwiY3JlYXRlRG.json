A little squirmy but that was expected. Some parts of the movie were a little slow for the little ones but 100% entertaining for the adults. The Frozen storyline is the best story of sibling love. The songs arent as good as the first movie but Into The Unknown is great, as well as the solo by Kristoff.  This was definitely a good sequel and we cant wait to add this one to the video library.","displayName":"Pam H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T00:31:33.178Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T00:31:33.178Z","user":{"userId":"1d46fb5f-846c-4be6-b0d6-2c355ec6df77","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Pam H","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Better and funnier than I ever thought it could be!","displayName":"Carol","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T00:30:59.857Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T00:30:59.857Z","user":{"userId":"75ac299a-1453-4f30-8bd0-069a3e277933","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Carol","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A beautiful movie!!! absolutely loved it!!!
