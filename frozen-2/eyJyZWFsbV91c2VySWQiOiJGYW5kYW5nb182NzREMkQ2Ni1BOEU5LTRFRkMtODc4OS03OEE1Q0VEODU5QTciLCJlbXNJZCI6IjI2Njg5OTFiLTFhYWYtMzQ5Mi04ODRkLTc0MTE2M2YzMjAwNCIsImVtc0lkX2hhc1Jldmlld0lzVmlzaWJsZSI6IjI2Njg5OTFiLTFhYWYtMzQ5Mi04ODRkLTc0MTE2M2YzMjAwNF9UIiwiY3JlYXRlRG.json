They made a successful princess sequel! This movie was amazing. It had a great story line that was easy for children to follow but yet had plenty of depth to keep an adult's interest. My 2-year-old daughter saw this for the first time in Bucharest, Romania. It was her first 3D movie and first IMAX movie (with Romanian subtitles). She kept the glasses on the entire show! We just got back to the states and went to see it for a second time. This time she never even took a bathroom break. She just sat on the edge of her seat until the credits began to roll which is when she got up (same as the first time) and began to dance to the music. We loved the songs. Especially the fact that each character has their own powerful song. This movie doesn't just have 1 good song...there are several. Frozen 2 was full of positive messages about female empowerment, growing up and even stereotyping. It is not only a great sequel, but possibly better than the original.","displayName":"Carissa O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-10T00:35:01.676Z","updateDate":"2019-12-10T00:35:01.676Z","user":{"userId":"b4c0940b-ce1e-4596-96f2-c333fd7513e0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Carissa O","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Is it just me or do they sing a lot more?
