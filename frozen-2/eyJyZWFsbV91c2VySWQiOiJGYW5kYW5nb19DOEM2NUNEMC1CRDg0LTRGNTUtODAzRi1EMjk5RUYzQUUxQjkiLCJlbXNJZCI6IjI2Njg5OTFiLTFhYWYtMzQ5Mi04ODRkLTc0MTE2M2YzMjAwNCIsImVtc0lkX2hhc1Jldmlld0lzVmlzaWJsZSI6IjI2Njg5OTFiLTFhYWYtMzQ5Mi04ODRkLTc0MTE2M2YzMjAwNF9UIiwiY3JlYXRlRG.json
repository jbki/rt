Don't get she/I wrong, Frozen 2 was a good movie that tied in with the first, it did seem to lack the luster like the first movie especially with really no \"hit\" scene and song like \"Let It Go\".   My daughter and I liked Olaf's \"When I am Older\", Sven's \"Lost in the Woods\" and Panic! At the Disco's closing  \"Into the Unknown\".  Face it: Disney will make money from this but most of its capital is because of the Frozen following from the first movie.","displayName":"J A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1008852239/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T22:21:24.410Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T22:21:31.084Z","user":{"userId":"978402858","realm":"RT","displayName":"J A","accountLink":"/user/id/978402858"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"i loved it. it was magical and enchanting.","displayName":"Denetria Serrato","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T22:21:22.819Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T22:21:22.819Z","user":{"userId":"95199E98-E5DB-4433-AB2B-28318610E601","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Denetria Serrato","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"I’m a Disney loyalist, an AP for years, and I am embarrassed.

Now the first Frozen, I actually thought was good. No where near as good as The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast as some fans were claiming, but still good. The trailers for this movie were intriguing and I had heard that this one would mature with this audience. That being said, I have some things to say about that. \n\nLike usual, the visuals are astounding. Disney and Pixar have really outdone themselves with the quality of their animation. The voice work once again is amazing. There's a few humorous moments in the movie that genuinely made me laugh. There was a good mystery in the story which made it watchable. However, that's about it in terms of good stuff for the movie, the rest of the film has some good stuff too, but it's nothing special. \n\nIn terms of this movie maturing with its audience, I don't really see that here. This movie in fact, really has no reason to exist beyond the fact that Disney wants to make another quick billion bucks. No one could've imagined how successful the first Frozen was going to be, so here we are 6 years later with another one with a lot less good qualities than the first. For a kids movie, this movies plot was quite jumbled and confusing at times. The song sequences are okay in this movie, but nothing on par with Let It Go from the first one. As annoying as that song was hearing it on the radio over and over and over and over and over again, the sequence itself was amazing. Gustavs entire arc in this movie is failed attempts at proposing to Anna, who's just not paying attention. Also, his song sequence is easily the worst in the film. Also...Olaf...yes he's cute and charming and has a funny scene but beyond that, I find him very annoying. So if you like the annoying little snowman, then you'll have a good time watching the movie. As I said before, this movie really doesn't mature with its audience at all. It's practically the same movie only with a different central plot. Nothing about this movie differentiates itself with the first one. The whole films existence as a whole just feels unwarranted and unearned. The ending of the movie tries to make it seem like the characters are going in another direction, but it really doesn't change ANYTHING. Now look, this movie didn't anger me or insult me like the second angry birds and pets movies did this summer. But in terms of animation, this film is nothing like Toy Story 4 or How To Train Your Dragon 3. \n\nI know kids will adore this film and that's perfectly fine. I just think that Disney really missed the mark with this one and couldn't justify its existence other than making money. Just like they did with all three of their remakes this year. I'm going to give Frozen 2, a C+","displayName":"Kyle A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T22:16:13.444Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T12:31:47.820Z","user":{"userId":"977683833","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kyle A","accountLink":"/user/id/977683833"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great movie and great story line wish they would have made both movies coexist a little more and maybe they would have found there parents","displayName":"dan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T22:15:13.441Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T22:15:13.441Z","user":{"userId":"B48EBBFE-8C26-4769-A9BF-D9BE56C0907D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"dan","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I'm sure there are going to be people that don't think this movie lived up to 6 year wait, but I'm definitely not one of those people.
