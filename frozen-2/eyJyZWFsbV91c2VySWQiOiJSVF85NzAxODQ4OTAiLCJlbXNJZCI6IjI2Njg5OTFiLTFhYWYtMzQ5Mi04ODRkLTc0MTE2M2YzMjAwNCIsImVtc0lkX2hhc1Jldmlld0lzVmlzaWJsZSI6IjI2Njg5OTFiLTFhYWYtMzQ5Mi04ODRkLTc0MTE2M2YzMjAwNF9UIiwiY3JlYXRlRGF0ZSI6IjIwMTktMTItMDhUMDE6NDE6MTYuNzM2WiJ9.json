Frozen 1 had terrific, inspired songs, catchy tunes, universal themes.  Frozen 2 had... songs that were loud and large (especially in imax) yet were boring and uninspiring.  I doubt they will sell very many soundtracks.\n\nThe story... well, this type of movie is mostly a vehicle for fantastic animation, so you don't expect too much plot, certainly nothing believable, yet there ought to be at least a modicum of consistency and logic to make the story flow smoothly. That was essentially lacking here; the baloney explanations about angry magic spirits were contrived.  \n\nIt seemed like the story writers were just making stuff up as they went along, trying to fit plot chapters to the big screen animation scenes rather than the other way around.  \"Let's have some huge, angry stone giants chasing them!  Think up a rationalization for that!\" and so forth.\n\nThe water spirit thing was downright silly.  It came in the shape of a horse that attacked Elsa in the water, trying to drown her, but Elsa escaped and ultimately tamed the horse with some kind of ice halter.  Or something.  From that point on, the horse or water spirit or whatever it was, was completely tame and friendly and allowed her to ride it all over the region.  I mean, why not just create an ice boat complete with sails and rudder, and pilot that across the ocean? Or just freeze the ocean. She's obviously powerful enough.\n\nThe fire spirit was... a newt?  Or a frog, or something.  After disastrously setting the forest on fire, it was tamed by Else who chased it and then... acted friendly toward it. The newt was cute, smiled and winked, and you know they were thinking about merchandise the entire time they were designing this thing.\n\nYeah, the rest of the story was just unbelievable and cringe-inducing at times.  But as I mentioned, the animation was fabulous.  It's advanced to the point where you wonder, why don't they just draw life-like humans instead of these huge-eyed doll-like beings?  The 360 degree camera angles, the zoom-in and zoom-out effects, and general attention to detail were exquisite.  Now if only they had added a great plot and music to match this state-of-the-art animation, it would have truly been a great movie on a par with the first one.","displayName":"Joe T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T00:58:55.678Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T00:59:02.918Z","user":{"userId":"977246644","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joe T","accountLink":"/user/id/977246644"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"}]}
