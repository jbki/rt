The whole feel of the movie was entirely magical, and as someone who's watched too many fairytales and fantastical movies it was a relief to see a movie that realized that it doesn't need a villain to drive a plot. Frozen 2 used changed and focused on how time moves everything to new places. Watching Elsa, who spent so much of her first movie afraid of herself, seek out who she is and what her purpose is was a satifying experience. Getting a change to see the relationships between each character and the level of emotion they held for each other made this movie for me. I got to watch characters I liked before grow into people I loved despite their flaws, because they were so real and good. Even Olaf became 3 dimentional, which was both suprising and gratifying. The pacing of the movie felt perfect, I wasn't bored at anytime, and the laughter and strife were perfectly balanced. It's a movie well worth watching and rewatching, which I most definetly plan to do.","displayName":"Farreh S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T23:13:25.486Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T23:13:25.486Z","user":{"userId":"978404626","realm":"RT","displayName":"Farreh S","accountLink":"/user/id/978404626"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Though the soundtrack wasn't as good as there first,  I thought this storyline was even better than the 1st.
