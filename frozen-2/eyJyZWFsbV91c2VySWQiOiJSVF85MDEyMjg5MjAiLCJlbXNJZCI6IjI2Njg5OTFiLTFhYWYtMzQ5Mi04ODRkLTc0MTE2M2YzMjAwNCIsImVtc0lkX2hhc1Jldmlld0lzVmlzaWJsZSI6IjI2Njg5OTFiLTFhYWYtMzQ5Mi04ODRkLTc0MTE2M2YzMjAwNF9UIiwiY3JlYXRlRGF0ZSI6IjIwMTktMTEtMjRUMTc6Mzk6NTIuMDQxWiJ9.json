Sequels rarely do, but the hype surrounding this movie gave me hope.  The plot was too dark, heavy and abstract, they tried desperately to capture the same magic of the song Let It Go, but missed the mark in a BIG way.  I found myself fighting to stay awake at times because the plot was erratic and hard to follow.  No way little kids have any idea what’s going on. I would recommend seeing it because it is Frozen, but you won’t come away singing any new songs or longing to see it again, and maybe- just maybe- that’s not a bad thing!","displayName":"Tom","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T17:38:19.750Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T17:38:19.750Z","user":{"userId":"DD248CF4-DA07-4771-BFBD-3BB2219CBA1C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tom","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Was good movie.\n1st frozen was better","displayName":"Ana","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T17:37:56.033Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T17:38:15.909Z","user":{"userId":"21abbd88-468c-4d20-b3c7-f3be5b5dcf4a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ana","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Better than the first movie, I'm blown away that it has gotten anything but 5 stars,  a lot of these \"professional critics\" do not know what they are talking about.
