The animation is incredible, the songs are fantastic, and the characters work very well together.

The exploration of the past and its truth really creates an exciting plot that is very original. Overall, Frozen II is even better than its predecessor and it is a very fun and imaginative film!

They are growing up the characters we fell in love with years ago and throughout the film even touched on growing up and change as a theme. They added such depth to the world of Frozen - going beyond simply giving Elsa and her parents a backstory and answers to where Elsa's powers came from. It does have a different feel than the original, definitely more mature and at times even slightly dark. I think a lot of people are disappointed because they go in expecting the same movie as the first; but I think they made this movie even more special because it can stand up on its own as great.","displayName":"Kayla N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1039504564/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T18:33:42.473Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T18:33:47.804Z","user":{"userId":"920709688","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kayla N","accountLink":"/user/id/920709688"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing graphics\nGreat movie over all and amaizng messgaes","displayName":"Taslin","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T18:33:25.513Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T18:33:25.513Z","user":{"userId":"db0ba1dc-93ba-48ec-84e9-23e44030e83c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Taslin","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"}]}
