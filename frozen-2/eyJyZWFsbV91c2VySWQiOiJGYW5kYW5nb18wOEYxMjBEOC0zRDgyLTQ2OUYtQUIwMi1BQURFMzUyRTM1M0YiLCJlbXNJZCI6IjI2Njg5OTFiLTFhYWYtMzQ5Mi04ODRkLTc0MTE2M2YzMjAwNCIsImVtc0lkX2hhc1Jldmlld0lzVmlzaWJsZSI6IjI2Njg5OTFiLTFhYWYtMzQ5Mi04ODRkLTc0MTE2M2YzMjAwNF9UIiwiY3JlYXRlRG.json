I like it, for sure, but it pales in comparison to other Disney animated films in almost every category. It's a film completely overshadowed by its soundtrack, and on its own is just a fairly typical Disney Princess story. But it's still entertaining, and I'll watch it if it's on. The sequel looks and sounds just as good as its predecessor but is largely inferior in most other categories. The story is convoluted, the writing is dull, the comedy is weak and the ending is shamelessly contrived. It's an attempt to have it both ways, making a sacrifice to gain a reward without actually having to lose anything to do so. It's clear that the story was the last thing on the developer's minds, as they needed to gets the music and set pieces sorted out first. As such, the plot is simply a device to get the leads from one song to the next. A lot of Anna and Elsa's interactions are just petty arguments, and the romance between Anna and Kristoff is marred with clumsy misunderstandings which the film passes off as ‘complications of love'. It feels like a sequel that was made because the first one was successful, not because there was a good reason to continue the story, and while it'll easily kill at the box office, that's all down to its predecessors legacy, not its objective quality.","displayName":"Wayne K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10205949674155460/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T01:07:03.992Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T01:07:06.092Z","user":{"userId":"970610344","realm":"RT","displayName":"Wayne K","accountLink":"/user/id/970610344"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a joyful amazing movie for all ages!","displayName":"Juan C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T01:05:23.821Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T04:09:42.323Z","user":{"userId":"63085FAC-8354-4342-9BEB-6A12EE6B2A64","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Juan C","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great Family Movie!!","displayName":"Papo","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T01:05:07.742Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T01:05:07.742Z","user":{"userId":"466FE218-C548-4303-B75B-9EB942CDCACE","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Papo","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"The music in this Frozen movie ranged from okay to down-right awful. Kristoff has a particularly 80s-esque music number that was painful to watch. \n\nOn the positive, the movie writers did a good job of building some mythology for the magic with which Elsa is born. I don't understand how the element of Fire some how became an animal side- kick,  but my daughter thought it was cute. \n\nOverall, though, my 3-year-old did not like the movie because,  \"Elsa's eyes went BOOM!\" I'm not sure what that means, but I have no reason to contradict her assessment.","displayName":"nscato","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T01:02:18.175Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T01:02:20.057Z","user":{"userId":"770af5cb-7664-4356-bf9e-309e1543f5a6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"nscato","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It was really great!

I have to say, though, that I didn't love it.    It was dark, both visually and thematically, compared to the first.   There were parts that seemed to drag a little.   Some of Olaf's jokes were not actually funny - I would expect more from the writers.   I also felt like there were some dots that needed connecting regarding the spirits in general and the 5th spirit and what it/she actually was.  What is Elsa's new purpose?   And how was her mother calling her with an audible voice?  Some loose ends that needed tying up.   There was also dynamic lacking between Christoph and Anna in the middle of the movie.  Again, lots of loose ends.  Overall, I just felt its was lacking in many areas.","displayName":"erika","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T00:56:33.264Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T00:56:33.264Z","user":{"userId":"4e8ec228-cb16-4fff-b819-ab0ee0fa10fb","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"erika","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The 2nd Frozen aged well with my daughter.
