Tonight though, we had a family outing and I didn't want to be left out.\nI am glad I went. This was an excellent movie. As my grandson Drew said, this version had a deeper story line than the first one.  Of course the music was also new,  but again, the music seemed richer and more entertaining.\nI was mesmerized by the animation. We have come along way since Bug's Bunny cartoons.  What a privilege to be able to take in all this technology, especially in 3D.\nBy the way, in my opinion Olaf was the star!  He is so adorable.\nPlease check out my movie review page at  reviewsbyjohnny.movie.blog","displayName":"John A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1539781579/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T05:19:26.644Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T05:19:32.067Z","user":{"userId":"876950577","realm":"RT","displayName":"John A","accountLink":"/user/id/876950577"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Laughed, cried and then laughed so hard I snorted!!!
