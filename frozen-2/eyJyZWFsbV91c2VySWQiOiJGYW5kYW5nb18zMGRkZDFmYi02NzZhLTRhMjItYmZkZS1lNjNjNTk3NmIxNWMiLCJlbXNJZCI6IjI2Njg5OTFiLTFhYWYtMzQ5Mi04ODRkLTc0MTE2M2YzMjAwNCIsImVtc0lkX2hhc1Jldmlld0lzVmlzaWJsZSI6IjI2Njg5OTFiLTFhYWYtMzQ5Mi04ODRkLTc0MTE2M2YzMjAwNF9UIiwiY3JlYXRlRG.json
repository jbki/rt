It was deeper too because it dealt with Elsa & Annas family history. I appreciated how the whole Elsa having a female companion was not at all how previews made it seem. Seeing it in D-Box was a lot of fun & made it exciting for all the children. I really enjoyed it along with my husband, our four and a half year old & 9 of her friends.

There's a rock power ballad with a chorus of reindeer, and it's NOT the best song in the movie, but it is worth the price of admission on it's own.
