All the characters you know and love are back and are on much more involved journey than last time. The plot is involved enough to keep an older crowd engaged, but still has all the classic trappings of a Disney movies for kids. (cute animals and all.) \n\nThe two things that cannot be praised enough are the positive portrayal of different types of characters and relationships for kids in some of these characters, and a sound track diverse and well composed enough to rival its predecessor.","displayName":"Joseph H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-18T18:42:21.432Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T18:42:23.719Z","user":{"userId":"978437152","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph H","accountLink":"/user/id/978437152"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A brilliant follow-up to an exceptional first outing. This movie had a lot to do to match up to its predecessor, it had to get the music and story spot on. Disney have done an excellent job here, creating a funny and charming sequel that feels more deserved than previous sequels that have been blatant cash grabs. They could easily have made a soft copy of the original but they instead ramp up the action and try a lot of new things. They definitely deserve some credit for that.\n \nHowever, this really is a tale of two halves. The first half is absolutely fantastic, Disney magic at its best, but the second half, whilst very good, is not quite as magical. The shift in quality is noticeable but not substantial.  Some of the story beats in the second half just felt really out of place.\n \nThe music is very good with enough catchy songs to keep the kids entertained. The title song is excellent but I doubt it will come close to capturing the imagination of its audience like Let It Go did, an admittedly almost impossible task.\n \nOverall you're left with a very good Disney Sequel that almost reaches the genius of the original. You won't be leaving it disappointed.","displayName":"Insta.
