It's so predictable that I joked about how the ending would go to my sister (I pretended I already watched the movie and was teasing her about spoilers) and got it 100% exactly right. I accidentally spoiled myself and my sister. \n\nIt's a downgrade from the original in my opinion and serves mostly for fan-service. Don't get me wrong, kids will still love it and it was still an enjoyable watch. It's just not as good as the movie that came before it.","displayName":"Gerald Y","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000162323216/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T15:48:04.528Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T15:48:10.146Z","user":{"userId":"917962743","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gerald Y","accountLink":"/user/id/917962743"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great Sequel.

Sequels are rarely as good as the original, and Frozen set a high bar. But this movie was absolutely incredible, even better than the first in my opinion. True, there is no song quite like Let It Go, but Show Yourself and Into The Unknown definately are of similar caliber. And The Next Right Thing resonated so deep I legitimately cried. All in all, this movie far exceeded my wildest hopes, and I'm very glad that I splurged on IMAX tickets","displayName":"Alayna","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T15:36:38.948Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T15:36:38.948Z","user":{"userId":"30239aa6-8c52-4902-8b62-4299a5295746","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Alayna","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Enjoyed the story and the humor.
