Sequels can often feel forced and like a money grab but this one felt like a great story line that answered a lot of questions from the first. It was a little intense and felt like it was geared toward all the little girls whom watched the first Frozen when they were 4 and are now a little more grown up and could handle the intensity. One of the little ones in our group (4yrs) could not handle the intensity and had to leave while another one was scared but stuck it out. The older girls (8ish) were really into it and loved it.","displayName":"Dodiza","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T04:35:52.118Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T04:35:52.118Z","user":{"userId":"ca3c0354-d645-4825-9ed9-f883d4bb391c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dodiza","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"LOVED the music, the big twist at the end, learning more about the parents (Guess they ARENT Tarzans parents after all!)

Frozen 1 had catchy songs and a good story line, unlike this one. I couldn't sing along to any of the songs and none will be added to my playlist.  I hated the plot, well if there was one. It was very confusing and i'm an teen. Don't know how a child could understand it. First movie should've been the last. Honestly this movie sucked. Frozen 3 should be illegal.","displayName":"Shelley","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T04:32:07.236Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T04:32:07.236Z","user":{"userId":"98baaefa-96ee-4840-aa7c-079344f147c9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Shelley","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The sisterhood was stronger and Elsa learned more about herself beautiful movie","displayName":"destinee","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T04:31:48.197Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T04:31:48.197Z","user":{"userId":"7a7faf6a-71c7-4e0c-acef-4777116d507c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"destinee","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"“Show yourself” was the highlight.","displayName":"Jessie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T04:30:48.199Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T04:30:48.199Z","user":{"userId":"A234AF57-F341-4268-B834-4B7622CD1691","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jessie","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent story line and animation.
