The original was new and perfect. Frozen 2 was a delight to watch as an adult.  There were a few corny moments, Kristoff's solo comes to mind.  Some of the themes will go right over your little one's head but that's the norm for Disney and your kids will still love it.  I love how the characters were further developed, especially Olaf who awarded us some great funny scenes.  Most of the music was amazing and the plot and screenplay are solid.  There's a lot to love and not much to complain about here!","displayName":"Wendy M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1278579761/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T11:54:05.296Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T11:54:13.953Z","user":{"userId":"978402048","realm":"RT","displayName":"Wendy M","accountLink":"/user/id/978402048"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I definitely believe it was better than the first movie. :) I loved it so much. :) My fave character is OLAF!!!","displayName":"Dennis T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/515577894/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T11:45:07.279Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T11:45:12.002Z","user":{"userId":"855230054","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dennis T","accountLink":"/user/id/855230054"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Visually stunning, music is wonderful, storyline amazing!!
