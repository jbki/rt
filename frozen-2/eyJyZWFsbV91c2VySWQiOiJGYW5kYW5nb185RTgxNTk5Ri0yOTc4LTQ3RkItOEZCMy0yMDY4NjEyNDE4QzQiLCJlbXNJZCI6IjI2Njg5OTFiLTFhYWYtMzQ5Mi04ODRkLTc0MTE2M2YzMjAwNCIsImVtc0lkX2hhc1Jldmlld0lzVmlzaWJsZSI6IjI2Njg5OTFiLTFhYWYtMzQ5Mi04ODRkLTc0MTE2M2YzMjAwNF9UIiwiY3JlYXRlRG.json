There was never a dull moment throughout the movie.  I loved how the colors of fall were combined with the colors of Frozen so well.  The message of respecting nature and one another as well as working together was amazing its so important for children to receive that message early in life.  The message of truth and history was also very important and put forth perfectly.  It was all around a wonderful movie!","displayName":"Luvvy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T18:46:52.246Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T18:46:52.246Z","user":{"userId":"53dd5979-2e91-4c53-8ddb-e18f197c5e74","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Luvvy","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"}]}
