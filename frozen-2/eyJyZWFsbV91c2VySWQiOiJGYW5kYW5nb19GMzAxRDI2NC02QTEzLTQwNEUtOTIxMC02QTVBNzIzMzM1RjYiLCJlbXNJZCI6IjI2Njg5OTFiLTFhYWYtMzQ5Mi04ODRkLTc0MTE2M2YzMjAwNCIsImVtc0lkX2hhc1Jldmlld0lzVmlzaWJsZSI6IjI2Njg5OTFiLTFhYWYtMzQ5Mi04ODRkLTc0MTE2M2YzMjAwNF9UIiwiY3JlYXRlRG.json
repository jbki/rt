I mean breathtaking literally, because you'll find your heart skipping a beat with every twist and turn. Even halfway through the film, it continues to take you by surprise. It's not a Disney princess movie at all. As Olaf very on-the-nosedly said, it's about transformation. At the end of the film, each character has changed and grown significantly. It's not perfect, but Frozen II is a harsh truth that we all should hear. Its aesthetic is sharp and striking but exactly fitting. As far as music goes, most of the songs are heart-wrenchers, but \"Lost in the Woods\" is my personal favourite. Altogether, Frozen II is a must-see if:\n1: you yearn for adventure\n2: you crave true emotion\n3: you're ready for something more.","displayName":"Anika W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T02:43:49.275Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T02:43:53.825Z","user":{"userId":"978403010","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anika W","accountLink":"/user/id/978403010"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"First movie for my daughter at 19 months.. first 45 minutes sat upright eyes glued.. she did better than I expected, the frozen addiction is certainly for real.
