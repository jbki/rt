It's definitely held up by it's reliably likeable main cast. Thematically it's a bit of a mashup of The Hobbit and The Fifth Element, but the result is it's own story, and it works really well. Possibly my main issue is that in this one the best song isn't also the emotionally most important one. But all in all it's a fun film for almost everyone, except maybe very young kids.","displayName":"Dylan G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100005228314679/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T10:04:16.471Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T10:04:22.633Z","user":{"userId":"946088666","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dylan G","accountLink":"/user/id/946088666"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Imagery was breathtaking.
