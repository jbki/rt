The boardroom was too distracted with Disney+ or something to keep this one on track. We adored the first Frozen and were so excited to see the sequel, but this was just plain awful.  I actually started to question whether or not Disney made this because it was so bad. Too many songs, plot was weak, and don't get me started on the water horse - where did that come from? Save your money and time and skip this one. Total snoozer.","displayName":"Jennifer P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10217635485533340/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T04:54:17.334Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T04:54:39.776Z","user":{"userId":"978409066","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jennifer P","accountLink":"/user/id/978409066"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very well done.
