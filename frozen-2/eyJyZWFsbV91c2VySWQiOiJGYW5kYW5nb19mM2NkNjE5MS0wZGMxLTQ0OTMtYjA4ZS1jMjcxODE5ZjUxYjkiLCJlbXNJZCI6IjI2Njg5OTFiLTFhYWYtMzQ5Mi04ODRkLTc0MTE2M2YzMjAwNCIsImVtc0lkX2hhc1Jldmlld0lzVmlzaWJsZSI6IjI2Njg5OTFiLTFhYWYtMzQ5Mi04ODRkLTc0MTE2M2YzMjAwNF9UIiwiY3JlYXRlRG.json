The film's plot is very similar to the one found in the last Airbender/AVATAR, however it fits with the awesomeness of Elsa's powers. The existance however, of Native Sub-Saharan African people in Arendelle (situated OFFICIALLY in Norway) makes no sense in the film and feels injected to please idiotic politics in kids movie. The action, however... does save us from paying attention to this nonsense and delivers epicness at it's finest","displayName":"Dylan Nicolas S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T19:27:48.099Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T17:27:24.391Z","user":{"userId":"978401661","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dylan Nicolas S","accountLink":"/user/id/978401661"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great movie for the kids and adults!","displayName":"Dan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T19:27:22.752Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T19:32:50.605Z","user":{"userId":"80BD1144-D737-43C7-B9A9-A7AEC87BE4F3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dan","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I have to say, I did not expect to enjoy this movie at all as someone who is really not a big fan of the first Frozen!
