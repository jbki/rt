It was dark, it expanded on the lore of this world. It took some inspirations from Avatar The Last Airbender, sure, but what in this world is original? There really wasn't a \"villain\" but instead focuses on more internal conflict, which is totally fine. In fact, the \"villain\" is the past. More specifically, the past mistakes the two main characters need to correct and move forward from. Much like today's youth. It was great. The music was wonderful. The themes were beautiful.
