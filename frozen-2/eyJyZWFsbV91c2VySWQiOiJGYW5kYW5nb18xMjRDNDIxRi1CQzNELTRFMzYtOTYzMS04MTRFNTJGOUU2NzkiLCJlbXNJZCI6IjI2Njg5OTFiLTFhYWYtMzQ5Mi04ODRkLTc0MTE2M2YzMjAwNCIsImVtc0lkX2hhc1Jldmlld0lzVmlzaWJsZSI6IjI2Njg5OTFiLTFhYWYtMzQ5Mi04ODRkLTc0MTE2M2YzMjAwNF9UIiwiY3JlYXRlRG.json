It wasnt as magical as the first. It felt like there were 3-5 different story lines they wanted to follow but realized the movie was 8 hours long if they kept everything so the smushed it all together any way. It would have been much better to cut certain new characters and certain scenes entirely. Into the Unknown was the best song and made the movie better, every other song felt forced. My kids (who were obsessed with the first movie since it came out) didnt even want me to download the soundtrack after we left the theater.","displayName":"Emily V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T00:33:07.337Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T00:33:07.337Z","user":{"userId":"6099fbbf-1393-4d0e-ab13-e7a0a6d84467","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Emily V","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great story with lots of excitement and twists!","displayName":"Laura M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T00:28:26.861Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T00:28:26.861Z","user":{"userId":"e757401b-eaab-4deb-b286-06ae1fcfd16a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Laura M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My 8 year old and 2 year old nieces loved it","displayName":"aunt Ginia","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T00:26:24.084Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T00:26:24.084Z","user":{"userId":"32E1975C-2CCE-4725-866A-A9E60D4913C5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"aunt Ginia","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Was a great a movie but hard to follow and Im an adult, my kids found it hard to follow as well.","displayName":"Beth","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T00:25:46.863Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T00:25:46.863Z","user":{"userId":"09c796e5-e121-4b58-bedb-c81e21982c5f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Beth","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Kids liked it but like us they got bored w all the singing.","displayName":"Ralph","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T00:24:29.077Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T00:24:29.077Z","user":{"userId":"3d38d00b-cad1-4f41-bc67-dd0995f8ceac","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ralph","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"}]}
