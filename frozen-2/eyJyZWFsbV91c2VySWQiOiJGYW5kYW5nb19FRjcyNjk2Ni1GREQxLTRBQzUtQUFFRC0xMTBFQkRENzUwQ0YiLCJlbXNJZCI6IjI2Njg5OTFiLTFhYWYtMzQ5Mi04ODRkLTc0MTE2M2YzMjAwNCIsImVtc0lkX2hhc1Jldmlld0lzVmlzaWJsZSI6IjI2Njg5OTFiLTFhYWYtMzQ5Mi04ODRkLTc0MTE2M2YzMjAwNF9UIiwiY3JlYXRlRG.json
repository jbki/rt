Frozen 2 is much the same, it has a few laughs and is charming enough, but isn't one of the best films of the year, nor one of Disneys better movies. But, it's much like the first, while being slightly better in my opinion, which I'm sure fans will appreciate. Plus, the music is much better this time round. If you liked the first, you'll like this too.","displayName":"Harry B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-11T09:50:08.901Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T09:50:12.440Z","user":{"userId":"977919658","realm":"RT","displayName":"Harry B","accountLink":"/user/id/977919658"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely wonderful.
