The movie will please the young target audience with excellent animation, character charm (especially Olaf, of course), and good music, even if it is not on par with the original. However, the plot was very thin and required significant retrofitting of the original movie's plot elements to create, and even with remodeling the events depicted in Frozen 1, there are enormous holes within this plot. When the adventure was established, the characters (especially Elsa) abandon their stated purpose. There is no central villain, other than, possibly, the girls' dead grandfather who of course poses no current threat. The story of the girls' lineage and especially of their mother makes no sense at all under the lightest of scrutiny. The acts of heroism end up working through coincidence rather than coherence. Yes, 7 year-olds will love it and I will end up seeing it multiple times. But this movie can't stand on its own and will be forgotten in time as most of the Disney animated sequels seem to be.","displayName":"David M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T02:25:19.066Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T02:25:27.889Z","user":{"userId":"978410235","realm":"RT","displayName":"David M","accountLink":"/user/id/978410235"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"on the same level as the first movie, although songs are not as catchy as the first","displayName":".","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T02:22:11.755Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T02:22:11.755Z","user":{"userId":"4475B4C7-4B83-4923-B674-8590AEEF1B1E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":".","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing movie!!
