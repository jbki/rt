Nonetheless, it maintains the charm from its predecessor and still is a much enjoyable ride into the unknown suited for kids and adults alike, particularly in the technical department where the visual effects are some of the best, if not the best, in animation, even in movie, history. I would watch this again just for the visuals.","displayName":"Brian T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T08:41:28.923Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T11:04:19.177Z","user":{"userId":"978401871","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian T","accountLink":"/user/id/978401871"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved loved LOVED this movie.
