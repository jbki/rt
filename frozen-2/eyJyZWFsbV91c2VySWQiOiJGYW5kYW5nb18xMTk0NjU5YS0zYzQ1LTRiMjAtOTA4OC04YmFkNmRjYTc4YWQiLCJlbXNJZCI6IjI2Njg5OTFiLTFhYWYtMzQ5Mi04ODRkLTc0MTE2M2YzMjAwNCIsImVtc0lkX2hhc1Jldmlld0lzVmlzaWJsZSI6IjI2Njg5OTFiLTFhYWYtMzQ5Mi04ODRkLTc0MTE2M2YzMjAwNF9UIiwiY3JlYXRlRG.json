Where did these people come from the past and how does it relate to the first part. While the songs where enjoyable, there was a point where I could not stand any more songs, just go on with the movie. I did enjoyed the jokes they threw in there, but other than that, it was dreading to watch. Sorry, but I was expecting much more and felt disappointed.","displayName":"Marielisa E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T15:33:55.002Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T15:33:55.002Z","user":{"userId":"65911993-c898-4f0c-b039-160caf6b9dd2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Marielisa E","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The movie was very sweet, the visuals wonderful, and the singing amazing.
