To make money that's what. The problem with trying to make up a sequel to a story you finished is that you have to ditch characters from the first movie that don't matter to the plot but no animation company is willing to do that because of loss of merchandising opportunities. A real shame.","displayName":"Courtney S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T01:28:08.043Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T01:28:08.043Z","user":{"userId":"978403106","realm":"RT","displayName":"Courtney S","accountLink":"/user/id/978403106"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"}]}
