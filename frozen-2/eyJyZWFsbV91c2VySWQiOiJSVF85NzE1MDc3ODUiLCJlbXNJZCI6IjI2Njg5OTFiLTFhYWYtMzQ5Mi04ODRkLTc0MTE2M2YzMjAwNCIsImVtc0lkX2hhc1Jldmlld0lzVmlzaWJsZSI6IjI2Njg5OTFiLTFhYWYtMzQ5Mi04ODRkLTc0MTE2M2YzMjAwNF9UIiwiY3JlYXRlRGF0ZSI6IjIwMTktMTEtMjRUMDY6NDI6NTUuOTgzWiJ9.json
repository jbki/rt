I was blown away by the scenes that were played along with the songs, and the rest of the story was a joy. I can see why critics are a little upset with the story, but I think they are ignoring the big picture: Disney has done it again with this astonishing sequel to the beloved Frozen franchise.","displayName":"a.prohductions","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T06:21:45.935Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T06:21:45.935Z","user":{"userId":"9CB93BD1-10D3-4C26-8F2C-513483D2D059","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"a.prohductions","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Truthfully, I'm not sure if the story made any sense. I'm very confused on the characters motivation in this movie.\n\nThere is really only two songs that knock it out in this movie, everything else felt like filler thrown in. But even when I watch the knockout song play out, the end to it and the beginning of it felt so disjointed in a narrative point of view.\n\nTo me, this movie read VERY direct to dvd sequel material. I'm not sure if this was as special as everyone makes it to be. But now that I think about it, maybe I didnt get the full picture of the story since when i went kids were dancing and running around and parents were taking pictures and videos of it the whole time and I couldnt focus. I'll definitely have to see it again without distractions. all in all, its fine. Not very memorable or special imho.","displayName":"Philip Stucky","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T06:21:11.174Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T06:21:11.174Z","user":{"userId":"8f36cf09-5130-4801-8e1f-7d10ad368d97","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Philip Stucky","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"}]}
