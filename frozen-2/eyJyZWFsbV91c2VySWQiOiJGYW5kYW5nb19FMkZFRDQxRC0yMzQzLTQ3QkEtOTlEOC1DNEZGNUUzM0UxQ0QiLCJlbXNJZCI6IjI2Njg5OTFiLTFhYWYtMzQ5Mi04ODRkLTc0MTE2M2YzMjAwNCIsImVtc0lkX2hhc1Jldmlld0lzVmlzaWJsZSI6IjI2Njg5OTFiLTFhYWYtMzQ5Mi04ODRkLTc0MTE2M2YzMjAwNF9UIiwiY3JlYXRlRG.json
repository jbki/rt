I've never had a movie make me this emotional in a really long time. So to the creators I say Bravo and keep doing what you're doing with movies to come. My daughter thought it was so interesting, as a three year, to be able to hold her attention is an incredible feat. I highly recommend this movie for the ypungsters.
