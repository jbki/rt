Absolutely no songs like Let it go or even Do you Want to Build a Snowman that kids (or anyone) will be singing, and although LIG got  overplayed still pretty epic and unforgettable whereas none of us can remember the songs in this movie which I find disappointing for Disney.","displayName":"Kori R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T05:06:46.021Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T05:06:46.021Z","user":{"userId":"849FE495-5B72-4827-BC23-3BB7AEEDA479","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kori R","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Soundtrack rocks!

It is great to kind of catch up with the characters and join them on another adventure, despite some random plot holes.  I still dont understand the purpose of the rock troll people - would have been nice if that link was explained...they seem to be throw away characters to me.  Music was good - but into the unknown blows all the other songs away. It is the theme song of the movie - it replays throughout.  My 2 1/2 year old son loved it - despite some scary scenes.  Id see it again, and Ive already been listening to soundtrack on repeat.","displayName":"Jenny","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T05:02:18.276Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T05:02:18.276Z","user":{"userId":"e7785d8a-5a30-48ea-aef2-2533fab9ffcb","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jenny","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I literally loved every scene I loved the way that they were able to continue the story.
