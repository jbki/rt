The songs were a little weak compared to the first one. This movies had a very deep lesson. It also dealt with many topics such as growing up, codependency, and trust. The plot in my opinion was a little weird but was still good. The movie also really focused on the development of each character: Olaf- growing up, Kristoff- love, Anna- Codependency, Elsa- finding herself. One last good point was that it was very funny.","displayName":"Gavin F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2314023102148700/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T22:33:35.648Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T22:33:48.762Z","user":{"userId":"978352677","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gavin F","accountLink":"/user/id/978352677"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"'Frozen II' features a more mature narrative, message, and general direction that rings a lot darker than its predecessor. But while relaying a good message to ages all around, the story itself isn't very engaging, flowing between scenes without too much narrative urgency or suspense.\n\nThat's mostly due to the cast of well-acted, but unappealing characters. Elsa mostly pushes past being the annoyingly meek (and ungrateful, come on, I would gladly sacrifice MORE THAN ONE sibling if I got cool ice powers) character of the first film, gratefully, evolving into a dangerously confident new person determined to get the answers her people needs. Everyone else sort of gets short-handed, though, particularly Anna, who gets entirely little to develop or do, especially as the sisters' relationship also annoyingly devolves into the same uncommunicative thread from the last film. Kids and bare-brained adults will probably like the movie, what with its many slapstick jokes—featuring Olaf, who's still just the worst, most annoying sidekick in any Disney movie—and cute, all-around bouncy tone, but the movie never really involved me in a meaningful way.\n\nA very meh soundtrack this time around doesn't help, even with the creative musical team returning for seconds. The score and primary theme themselves are actually pretty good, though, and much more memorable than the new songs, which go through the motions of their accompanying scenes without much catchiness or clever lyrics. The same could be said for the movie all around.","displayName":"Hector V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T22:32:47.941Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T22:32:47.941Z","user":{"userId":"977436384","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hector V","accountLink":"/user/id/977436384"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved every minute of it.
