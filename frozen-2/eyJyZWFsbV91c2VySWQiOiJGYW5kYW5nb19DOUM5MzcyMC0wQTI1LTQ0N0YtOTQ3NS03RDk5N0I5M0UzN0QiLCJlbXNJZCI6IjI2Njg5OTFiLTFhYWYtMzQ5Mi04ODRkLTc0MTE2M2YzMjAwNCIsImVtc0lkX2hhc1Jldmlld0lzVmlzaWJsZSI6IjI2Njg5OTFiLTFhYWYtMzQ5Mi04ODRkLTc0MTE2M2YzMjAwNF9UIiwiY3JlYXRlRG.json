Ok, I get it, girl power! And women dont need men. Gotcha. There was nothing at all heartwarming (no pun intended) about this second installment. I could see where they were tryyyyying to go there, but it never quite landed. Not the parts with the parents ship and then their spirits or whatever (?) up on the icy island, not the part where Elsa brings Olaf back, not the proposal. They didnt even explain how the girl saved the prince and then ended up marrying him one day. Who raised her in the meantime? How did no one know where she was from? Olaf cracks a few jokes but the majority of the movie feels like unmemorable song after unmemorable song, squashed together with no real interesting story. And again, Elsa has no love interest ... and now shes living in the frozen north away from her family. How touching.","displayName":"Bryana P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T17:51:17.803Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T17:51:17.803Z","user":{"userId":"bbe737d9-3c20-4e47-b2aa-e608bb042578","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bryana P","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"}]}
