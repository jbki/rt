We both LOVED Frozen II! This was a wonderful addition to the story. It was more in-depth and less sugary than the first one. It answered some questions left from the first movie and gave both Else and Anna quite the adventures. I love that this is less about romantic love and more about family and finding strength in yourself! We will definitely watch this again and again.","displayName":"Rachel","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T17:35:28.595Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T17:35:28.595Z","user":{"userId":"656ac8da-0232-47eb-8554-80620ccafa1b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rachel","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Might be better then the first one","displayName":"Erica Smith","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T17:35:02.365Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T17:35:02.365Z","user":{"userId":"4c703a2b-e688-486d-b38d-164e271819a5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Erica Smith","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The 80s montage was the best part!","displayName":"Tara M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T17:32:42.119Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T17:32:42.119Z","user":{"userId":"f118697c-1010-4bf9-baa5-e7fb617083f9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tara M","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Not as good as the first, in story line and the songs, but my daughter loved it!!","displayName":"TJ P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T17:30:41.123Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T17:30:41.123Z","user":{"userId":"693AAFD3-6E65-4597-990A-F10D32905C2D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"TJ P","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Stunning, Beautiful, strong, Magical","displayName":"Erick M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1045243392272501/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T17:30:08.794Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T17:30:14.520Z","user":{"userId":"976460244","realm":"RT","displayName":"Erick M","accountLink":"/user/id/976460244"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved it just as much as the first!
