The movie seems to be awkward to understand at times, what caught my attention was the line \"water has memory\".  What happen to the expective of water actually transforming.  It takes away, the meaning of innocent magestic FROZEN.","displayName":"Maria G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/132497621511142/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T06:26:50.248Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T20:58:27.400Z","user":{"userId":"978413685","realm":"RT","displayName":"Maria G","accountLink":"/user/id/978413685"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Not as good as the first but still fun family movie!!
