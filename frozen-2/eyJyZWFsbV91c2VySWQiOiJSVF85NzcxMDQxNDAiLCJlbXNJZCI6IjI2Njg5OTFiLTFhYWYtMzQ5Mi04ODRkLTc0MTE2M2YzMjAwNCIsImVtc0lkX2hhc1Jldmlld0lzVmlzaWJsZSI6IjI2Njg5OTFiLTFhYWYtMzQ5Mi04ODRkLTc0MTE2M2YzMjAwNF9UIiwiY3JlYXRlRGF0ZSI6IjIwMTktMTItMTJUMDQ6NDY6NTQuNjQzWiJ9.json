This movie gave a lot of effort to create those LOL moments with Olaf and the Awe moments with Elsa and Anna. Great job! Although the songs were on the weak side and the big ending with Panic At the Disco was very strange...","displayName":"Nathan N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001901288092/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T04:37:15.428Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T04:37:18.371Z","user":{"userId":"945421133","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nathan N","accountLink":"/user/id/945421133"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was way more mature than the first, but it is so good. Full grown adults got to genuinely laugh and cry in the theatre alongside kids. When Next Right Thing came on, I bawled because at the time I saw it, my future was uncertain and I really related to the song deeply. The animation was stunning, the music was beautiful, and the storyline was magical. \nIf youre worried about bringing your kids, I think its a good conversation starter about some more serious things. The movie is fun and beautifully animated but it will tug at your heart strings. If your child has faced loss of any kind, I actually think this movie can help them learn to grow and cope and heal. If your child hasnt faced loss, it may help them learn to communicate with others who have. Frozen 2 is a bit harder for them to watch, but theyll likely understand nonetheless and learn to show more compassion from it. \n10/10 would recommend to anyone and everyone.","displayName":"Shania","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T04:37:01.161Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T04:37:01.161Z","user":{"userId":"9f1e050c-ffdb-43fe-a3bb-00778dd1f144","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Shania","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"i liked it - great music , fun for all the family","displayName":"h fearn","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T04:35:37.548Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T04:35:37.548Z","user":{"userId":"54716867-46e6-4ca7-abbc-497048ccbcd0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"h fearn","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Definitely a movie that you want to take your kids to see.
