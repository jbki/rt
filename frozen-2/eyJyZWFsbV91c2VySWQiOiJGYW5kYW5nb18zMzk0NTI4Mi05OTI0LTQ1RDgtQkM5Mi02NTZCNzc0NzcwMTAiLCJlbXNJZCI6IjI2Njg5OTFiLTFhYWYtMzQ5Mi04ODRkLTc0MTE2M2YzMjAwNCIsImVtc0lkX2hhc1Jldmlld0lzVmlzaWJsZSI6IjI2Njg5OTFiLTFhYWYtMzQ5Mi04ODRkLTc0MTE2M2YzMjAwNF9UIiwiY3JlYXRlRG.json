It was fun and the pace went quick enough to hold both the attention of kids and adults alike. It wasn’t plagued with any moments that had you just wishing the story would progress or the movie would end. Josh Gad did his job of providing the comic humor and his character Olaf provided quite a good amount of laughs especially with his “one-man-show” recaps. I wouldn’t say it was as good as the first movie but it was definitely enjoyable. One downfall to the story is that it doesn’t give much closure in the death of Anne and Elsa’s parents or really explain WHY Elsa has powers. Overall a great movie that is definitely worth it to see!
