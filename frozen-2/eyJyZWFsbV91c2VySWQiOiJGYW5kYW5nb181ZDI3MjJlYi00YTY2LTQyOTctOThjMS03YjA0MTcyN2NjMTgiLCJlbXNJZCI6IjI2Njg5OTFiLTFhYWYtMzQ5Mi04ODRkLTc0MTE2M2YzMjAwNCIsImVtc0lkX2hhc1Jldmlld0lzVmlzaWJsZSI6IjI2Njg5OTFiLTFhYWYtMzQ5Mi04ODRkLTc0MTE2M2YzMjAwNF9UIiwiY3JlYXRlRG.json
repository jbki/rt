The whole family loved the epic nature of the film. There are a few gaps in the story where they took some big liberties in favor of moving the story along quickly that left us with a few questions.

Each brought to light very real emotions of love, grief, courage, and allowing yourself to express and explore these feelings. However, I didn't like the way they had Anna jumping to conclusions anytime Christoph would say something that could be taken wrong. That part felt a bit sexist, but that was NOT the tone for the whole movie.","displayName":"Rowan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T13:20:23.828Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T13:20:23.828Z","user":{"userId":"5d4d44aa-78f5-46db-a5b1-7d0ad13b977a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rowan","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The storyline was so good!
