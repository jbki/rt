Your idiot employee and system doesn't have a instant update you inform you're customers is something's changed so when i get to the theater everything seems ok, my QR code tickets don't alert them when i let the lady scam my phone, however when i astride to my seat, another family had just purchased the very same seats i took an hour to pick out a week earlier with with fresh paper tickets because your system didn't update to not only give me my credits back for my 6 purchased tickets, but it didn't tell me that my tickets were invalid now because is you're idiotic employee who credited 6 tickets without being told to credit 6 tickets. So you not only stole $36 dollars from me, but your made my family fun movies night into a living nightmare because we missed almost half the movie by being told to wait outside in thelobby while the theater employee figured everything out due to your screw up Fandango.
