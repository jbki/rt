The main point of the movie, however, is that Elsa is the bridge between the spirits representing the four elements. Because, Elsa's mom had two daughters, Elsa is also one side of the bridge, while her sister, Ana, is another. The movie concludes with nature saying thanks to Elsa.","displayName":"Alexander R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1433815096785368/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-09T11:01:09.407Z","updateDate":"2019-12-09T11:01:15.725Z","user":{"userId":"978419262","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alexander R","accountLink":"/user/id/978419262"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 09, 2019"}]}
