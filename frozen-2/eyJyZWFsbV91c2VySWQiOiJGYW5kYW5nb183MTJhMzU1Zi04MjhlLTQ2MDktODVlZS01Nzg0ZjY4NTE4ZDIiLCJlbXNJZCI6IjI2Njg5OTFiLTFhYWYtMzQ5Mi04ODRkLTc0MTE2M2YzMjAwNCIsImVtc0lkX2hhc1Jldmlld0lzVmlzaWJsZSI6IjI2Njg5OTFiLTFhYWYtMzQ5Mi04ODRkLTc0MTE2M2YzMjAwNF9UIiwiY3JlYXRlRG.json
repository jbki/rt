Not only that, but Elsa and Anna's mother being apart of the tribe of the forest? She looks nothing like an Indigenous person, and the little girl that was supposed to be her looked completely different. Broader nose, thicker lips and a round face, brown eyes, curly hair?? This feels like a poor attempt to cover up a character they decided to scrap, rather than an actual child version of their mother. It had gorgeous animation, and 3 very good songs, but besides that? This movie was a huge disappointment.","displayName":"Annie C.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T00:06:14.348Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T00:06:14.348Z","user":{"userId":"2e16a20e-dbb9-4672-bb7e-fc3f6cd42d1d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Annie C.","accountLink":null},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"}]}
