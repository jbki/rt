They must be Disney brainwashed people; you know, those adults that go to Disneyland without kids? The movie was terrible. The songs were forced and poorly written. Nobody is buying this soundtrack like they did for the first Frozen. Plot was thin at best. This was terrible. If I bought this as a $3.99 rental, I would still feel ripped off. By the way, did Olaf get trained by Jar Jar Binx for this film? He was exceptionally poorly written.","displayName":"Michael W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T05:04:33.176Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T05:09:10.207Z","user":{"userId":"978409083","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael W","accountLink":"/user/id/978409083"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a wonderful movie with a powerful message.

Several morals emphasized and my 4 year old granddaughter may have been too young to stay with the length of the film. There were others with younger children who were in and out of the theater to allow for bathroom breaks and changes of environment. We did stay with the movie as it was my granddaughters first theater movie.
