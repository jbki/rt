I went in trying to give this a fair shake, but where the original only soured on me after watching, this one had me sinking into my chair in despair.\n\nThe good: Some of the jokes were funny and well-timed. Elsa fights a horse.\n\nThe bad: Where do I start? I have no sense of Elsa's motivation in the beginning, it's just vague longing. The inciting moment happens seemingly for no reason at the end of song. I missed what she even did, if she did anything. Her entire goal ends up being to get to some glacier of unclear significance. It's loosely tied to a revelation about their parents trying to figure out her powers. There's a whole subplot about whats-his-face trying to propose to Anna, which they clumsily build up for the whole movie's runtime and then throw in the garbage when he gets interrupted by Anna and Elsa's weird sister complex once again. And their relationship dynamic seems so fickle and arbitrary that as soon as they lose sight of each other, they despair that they're falling out of love. But I don't believe it. None of the writing takes me to where the characters are feeling, it's all just unmotivated plot points so they can get to the next badly-written power ballad.\n\nAnd oh my god, the lyrics. The lyrics in the musical sound like they were written in another language and translated to English. There's no flow, barely any hooks, and it all happens at plot points where it feels obligatory instead of organic.\n\nThe theme appears to be either \"push your family away and things will work out fine\" or \"if one bad man in your country's past does something bad, destroy your country\". Which doesn't happen anyway thanks to Elsa's deus ex machina.\n\nI don't know who directed this movie, but it feels like they were steamrolled by any number of committees who had their own goals. This is not a well-crafted story.","displayName":"Nick M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/82800968/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T05:15:06.302Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T05:16:06.561Z","user":{"userId":"783868467","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nick M","accountLink":"/user/id/783868467"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"What happened to the good Disney movies?
