After Arundale is threatened, she sets off on an adventure with the others to uncover the truth about her familys past and reveal her true purpose. While not as memorable as the first movie, the storyline is solid and the animation really shines in places. The music isnt as catchy as the earlier film, however there are a few songs Id add to the playlist, including Show Yourself.  The parents backstory and truth, while predictable, lends to the maturing of each character. Except Olaf, he was irritating, not funny, and Kristoff, whose role felt very forced.","displayName":"Shelly","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T14:16:02.253Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T14:16:02.253Z","user":{"userId":"76355612-8285-444f-9a89-3945a426c13f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Shelly","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This was a sweet movie that tied the two stories together pretty well.

And, if it was able to even obtain half of that original movie's charm and excitement than I'm sure most audiences would leave their local theaters pleased and satisfied. However, the writers of \"Frozen 2\" really missed out on a golden opportunity. The story could have been so much better, and could have included many more elements of surprise, fun, and charm. Instead, the story (this time) was rather dry, predictable and even a little boring at times. \n\nHaving said that though, I enjoyed most of \"Frozen 2\" as the (updated) visuals in their latest animation were absolutely amazing, and I still adored the original cast of characters as much as I did in the previous movie, as their personalities, dialogue, behavior was very much in the same manner as before. The music, while not as catchy or creative as the first movie, was good enough and was entertaining throughout. Also, the character Olaf was particularly funny and sometimes kept the movie from being too dry in certain scenes. Although I'd have to say the writers did get a little carried away with a little too much.. Olaf in the script.\n\n\nAll in all, \"Frozen 2\" was a decent movie, but it probably won't leave a long lasting impression on too many movie watchers out there and certainly won't make too many people want to buy the movie soundtrack or other (related) merchandise afterwards. This is where Disney will feel the 'hurt' the most, the post-marketing of the film. In my honest opinion, Frozen 2 was okay at best, and could have been much better with a little more thought and effort put into the script, story-line and music.","displayName":"Donald Y","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T13:28:08.852Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T13:28:14.120Z","user":{"userId":"977245619","realm":"RT","displayName":"Donald Y","accountLink":"/user/id/977245619"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very good film.
