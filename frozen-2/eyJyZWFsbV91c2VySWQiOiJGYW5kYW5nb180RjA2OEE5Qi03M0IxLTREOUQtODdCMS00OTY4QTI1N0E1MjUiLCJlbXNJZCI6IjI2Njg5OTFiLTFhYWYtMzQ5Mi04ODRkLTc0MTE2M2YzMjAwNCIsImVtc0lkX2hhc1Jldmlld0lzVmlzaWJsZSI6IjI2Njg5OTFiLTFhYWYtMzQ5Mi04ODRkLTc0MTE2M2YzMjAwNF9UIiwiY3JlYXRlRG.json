I was very impressed with this new film!! I loved it so much, I want to see it again! Now I'm going to admit, I was one of the 1% of people that didn't thought the first film was this amazing masterpiece, just thought it was ok but I love how they handle the characters, specially Kristoff and Olaf this time around! It was mature, clever, hilarious and a fun!! I highly recommend this film!! And those songs!! Ahhh Kristoff singing an 80s love song was THE best!!

The animation is breathtaking, and an overall entrancing sense of majesty and depth permeates the film with the emotional vigor that only Disney can invoke. The look and feel of the film, actually, embody so a strong a presence as to even succeed (mostly) in disguising and compensating for the lack of character development and a story which I cannot describe better than with adjectives such as \"familiar,\" \"predictable,\" and \"recycled.\" Elsa and Anna passionately lead the charge again here, yet, unlike in the first film which showcased significant personal growth for them both, although this movie does reveal more of their backstory, their internal development remains rather stagnant. Olaf here, who I perceived as having been reduced to a comic relief (his purpose in the first film felt more significant than that), surprisingly throws a philosophical spin on the humor, offering a somewhat redeeming quality to his purpose in this film and, even more so, a profoundly insightful freshness to his jokes which I found to be thoroughly interesting. Kristoff, in a blunt way, is also simplified as a character, yet he IS given a glorious ballad which simultaneously is both very sweet and funny in how fantastically corny it is. The songs/musical sequences, as a whole, are consistent and vivacious, my personal favorite being Elsa's \"Show Yourself\" which is utterly beautiful and a rich feast for anyone's Disney magic goosebumps (and yes, there is a substitute for \"Let It Go\" here, but this song is not it). In terms of how this sequel balances with its predecessor, it features a solid portion of the same yet also a hefty helping of the new. As a sequel, it operates on fair ground, referencing its origins regularly without overstaying its welcome while introducing enough new things to allow it to stand on its own. In the end, though, it all comes down to the bottom line which began this review. This particular movie works best as an antidote to satisfy a persistent craving or curiosity for more than simply just the first film. However, for those whose visit to Arendelle was satisfied with the first Frozen, they may find this sequel to be inessential.","displayName":"John S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100004096696928/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T06:42:15.288Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T06:42:17.733Z","user":{"userId":"933027027","realm":"RT","displayName":"John S","accountLink":"/user/id/933027027"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!","displayName":"Rosie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T06:41:59.108Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T06:41:59.108Z","user":{"userId":"10240a3d-ee09-4d18-8478-c1d73f7ad39f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rosie","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Dragged in parts.
