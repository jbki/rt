The songs were good (Nothing that will capture lightning in a bottle like Let it Go but good). The biggest reason I feel that this is better is the character development that happened between the movies. All the characters really grew and it added depth to each of them. Definitely worth going to the movies for and not waiting for redbox. üòÅ ‚ùÑÔ∏è","displayName":"Lance K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10206792009954834/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T14:30:57.716Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T14:31:04.979Z","user":{"userId":"978400590","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lance K","accountLink":"/user/id/978400590"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was everything you could have wanted and more.
