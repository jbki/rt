Not as iconic as first movie and no iconic songs like the first one. Moral of story was nice though and it did have some pretty hilarious and heartwarming Disney scenes. Animation was ok but in sometimes felt like voices didnâ€™t fit with their character.In my opinion the best things about this movie was the music score from the Lopez brothers and productivity for action ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T00:31:32.180Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T00:31:32.180Z","user":{"userId":"260172601","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260172601"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"}]}
