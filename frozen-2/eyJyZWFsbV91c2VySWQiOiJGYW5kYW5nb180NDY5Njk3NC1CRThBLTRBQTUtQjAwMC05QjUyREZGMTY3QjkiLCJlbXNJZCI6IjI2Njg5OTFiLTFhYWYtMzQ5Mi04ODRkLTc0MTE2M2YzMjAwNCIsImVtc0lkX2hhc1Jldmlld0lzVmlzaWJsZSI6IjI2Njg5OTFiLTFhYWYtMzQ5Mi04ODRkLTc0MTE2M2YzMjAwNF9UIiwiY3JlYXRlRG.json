Kristoff was barely in the movie. Olaf was more annoying and his song is basically the same as the one in the first. There is no bad guy. And there is no sense of adventure since everything is basically right next to each other. The new characters were fun, but you barely saw them too. If they make a third movie, it probably wouldn’t have to do with anything in this one. The movie is that pointless.","displayName":"Jase","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T17:51:08.200Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T17:51:08.200Z","user":{"userId":"D4A1C4D3-ED0E-467A-BBF3-3423299F8226","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jase","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Liked it better than the first one!
