So besides not having any discernable plot and making my family wish they had watched the original for the 100th time, the movie is totally political.  Theme:   Anna, Elsa and the gang are called away to learn the 'truth' about their past.  Turns out, their grandfather brutally murdered the native peoples' leader and lied to  them to build a dam that put a curse (ruined) on them and their land for 35 years.     They made reparations by destroying the dam and freeing the indigenous from the curse.   There was not one memorable song, it was awful.  We spent $80 on tix and popcorn and both my children said it was not good.","displayName":"eric d","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T00:16:22.720Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T00:16:22.720Z","user":{"userId":"978401353","realm":"RT","displayName":"eric d","accountLink":"/user/id/978401353"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very good, slow start but picks up!
