I took three of my granddaughters (ranging in age from 12 to 26) and my three great-grandbabies. All attendees, including myself, immensely enjoyed the movie. They were smart, they all watched Frozen before joining me at the theater. I wish that I had thought ahead and indulged myself in a refresher movie prior to watching Frozen II. I had forgotten a lot about how it had ended but I still enjoyed the movie tremendously.","displayName":"Cyndee G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T05:03:04.943Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T05:03:04.943Z","user":{"userId":"7790a946-71c0-4586-aedb-9bf695efb2b3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Cyndee G","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Breath taking!
