I have already seen the movie twice now and I loved it even more the second time I saw it. Everything about this movie is great from the cast, to the story, to the action, to the music to even the animation frozen 2 takes everything that people loved from the first frozen and in my opinion made it even better. If there is any problem with this movie it is the character of Kristof who has a small role but that doesn’t even take me out of the experience because the rest of the cast give it there all and they nail it. There is also some huge tear jerking scenes in this movie that had me in tears the second time I saw it. Overall, frozen 2 is one of my favorite sequels of all time, this movie took a lot of the things I did like about the first frozen and made them better and also improved on the things I didn’t like from the first frozen, I love this movie and I already am planning to see it a third time. GO SEE THIS MOVIE.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-18T20:41:06.938Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T20:41:06.938Z","user":{"userId":"260342365","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260342365"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 18, 2019"}]}
