I think the story line really grew up with the orginal audience. My daughter was 1 when the first Frozeb came out and she absolutely LOVED this one as well. I loved the storylines of taking the time to find out who you really are, love not being a fragile thing and it is ok to have communication mishaps and that it doesnt mean a relationship will end. I loved the supportive male roles to powerful females. That they worked alongside each other not trying to overshadow the other. I loved the hilarious comic relief moments, the powerful songs which were much more Broadway musical style opposed to traditional cartoons. I couldnt reccomend this movie more. I cant wait for it to come out on video so we can watch it again and again","displayName":"Courtney L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10162051588520144/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T19:21:44.015Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T19:21:47.888Z","user":{"userId":"978405831","realm":"RT","displayName":"Courtney L","accountLink":"/user/id/978405831"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Did not disappoint!
