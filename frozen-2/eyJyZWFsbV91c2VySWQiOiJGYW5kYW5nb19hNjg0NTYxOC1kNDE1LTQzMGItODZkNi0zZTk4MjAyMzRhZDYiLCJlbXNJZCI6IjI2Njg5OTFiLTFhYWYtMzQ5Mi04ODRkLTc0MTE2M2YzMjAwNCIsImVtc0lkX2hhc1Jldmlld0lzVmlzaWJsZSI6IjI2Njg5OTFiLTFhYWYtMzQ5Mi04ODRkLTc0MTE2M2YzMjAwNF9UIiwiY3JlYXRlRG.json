So everybody except for the evil fianc√© is back.  The elements appear to be turning against the town of Arendelle, so they've got to band together to see what exactly is going on.  Cut to a road trip to a magical forest.  Now as I previously established, I love the first Frozen.  I think the music rocks, the flow is great, and even though there are many parents out there that can't stand it, I feel like it still stands up as a terrific Disney film.  I thought the trailers to this looked really good, and even though it wasn't really clear what the story was going to be about, they sold it with some great visuals and some music that sounded to be on par with the original.  While I won't go as to say that I disliked this, I will say that this is a far cry from the first movie.  Now even though I can't say that all my expectations were met on this, I don't want to come down too harshly, as this isn't without its merits.  The animation is as beautiful as it was in the original, and it is a great looking film.  All the voice acting is quality, and everybody does exactly what they are getting paid to do.  There's not even all that much I disliked about this, and my attention was held throughout.  So why am I not singing this movie's praises?  Well, it is the music when you break it down.  Don't get me wrong, it is well-executed and all the right notes are hit.  The problem is that it is way less catchy this time around.  As I type the initial first draft of this review, I saw this movie not less than 9 hours ago, and I honestly can't even name one song or tune from this.  I remember this one Chicago style song that made me laugh, and there were a couple of emotional songs from Elsa about the unknown, but as you can see, the specifics are hard to come by, which was not a problem I had with the original, even from the first time I watched it.  There's also no showstopper like Let It Go, and that is a loss that is certainly felt.  There's also a lot more Olaf this time around, which isn't something that I was necessarily looking for, especially in the wake of his failed short that preceded Coco.  I feel like he works best in small doses, and for the majority of the time, I honestly felt like he was just making scenes take longer.  There is this story plot point with the ancestors that comes in during the third act which I really appreciated, but there was also this Fifth Element component which really felt more trite than anything, so that balances out.  Frozen II held my attention, but I was really hoping that this would have connected with me so much more than it actually did.","displayName":"John M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/25106477/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T14:13:19.582Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T14:13:21.638Z","user":{"userId":"782214838","realm":"RT","displayName":"John M","accountLink":"/user/id/782214838"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Perfect sequel to the first one !","displayName":"Joe M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T14:12:59.956Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T14:12:59.956Z","user":{"userId":"c33715c3-99cc-4fba-b3d1-c04e7955fdf6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joe M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is the first movie my daughters watched without moving from their seats!
