It was enjoyable, but it was just Disney following the zeitgeist while utilizing their standard formula. It was great fun and my niece was dancing the entire time. It's well worth seeing in theaters, but I probably won't watch it again. I drew more joy from my niece's reaction than anything else. It's a wonderful film to watch with your family.","displayName":"Michelle A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T23:07:19.442Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T23:07:24.587Z","user":{"userId":"789835563","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michelle A","accountLink":"/user/id/789835563"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"it was fine some funny moments, one decent song. otherwise it was just trying to be avatar the last airbender.","displayName":"Nick","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T23:06:34.477Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T00:23:03.837Z","user":{"userId":"A1BE8E48-D31C-4848-B38A-3FC8FCF64379","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Nick","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"}]}
