Frozen 2 suffers from a disjointed plot and struggles to follow a single narrative. The movie jumps from one storyline to another which unnecessarily complicates things and some songs seem to cue at awkward times. As someone who loved the first one, I had high expectations and although they weren't met to the fullest, the movie contained more on Elsa and Anna's parents, the origin of Elsa's powers and the sisters' relationship development which is what I was most looking forward to seeing. Despite lacking the lightheartedness of 2013's Frozen, it remains an awesome adventure worth watching if just to get to see the characters again.","displayName":"Farah R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T16:29:54.596Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T18:08:27.985Z","user":{"userId":"916050255","realm":"RT","displayName":"Farah R","accountLink":"/user/id/916050255"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Not that great as the original.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T16:28:14.265Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T16:28:14.265Z","user":{"userId":"260238465","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260238465"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it !!!
