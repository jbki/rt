Most of the main cast is useless and has no bearing on the plot, it force-feeds emotions to its audience that it never quite earns, and it builds a backstory to Arendelle that probably required a much longer movie to make believable. Despite all this, it’s still a stunningly gorgeous film and a marvel to watch. And who can forget the raw truth of Kristoff’s response when Ana apologizes for leaving him behind? “It’s okay,” he says, “my love isn’t that fragile.” Just like that, Kristoff becomes a hero, too.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T04:36:37.297Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T04:36:37.297Z","user":{"userId":"959436567","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/959436567"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"The movie was ok.
