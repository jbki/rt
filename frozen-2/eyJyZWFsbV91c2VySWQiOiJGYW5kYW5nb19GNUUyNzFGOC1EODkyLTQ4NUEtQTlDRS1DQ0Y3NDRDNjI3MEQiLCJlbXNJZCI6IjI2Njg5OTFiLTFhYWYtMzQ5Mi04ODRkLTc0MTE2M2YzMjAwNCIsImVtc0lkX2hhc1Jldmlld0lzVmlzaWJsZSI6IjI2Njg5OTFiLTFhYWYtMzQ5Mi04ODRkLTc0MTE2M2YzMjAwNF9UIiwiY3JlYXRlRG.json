Christoph's song made sense lyrically, but the Queen-esque 80's power ballad look and feel to it was bizarre and out of character for the whole movie. An analogy: image if in Cinderella there was a scene where the evil step mother started rapping. It would be funny, but entirely out of place. That's how Christoph's song felt. The movie's formula: problem, song, \"oh look here's a thing I'm going to do\", repeat. Just because the characters are established doesn't mean the movie shouldn't take time to establish the new motivations and how these \"newly\" changed characters will deal with it. Finally, they introduce a lot of new characters and lore and spend zero time with them. It's more like a drive by \"look there's a Hans lookalike, there's this tribal leader, bye! We won't see you until the closing scenes half an hour from now! It isn't a bad movie but given how good the first one was this failed to meet expectations. 5.9/10. (also, the rock ballads in the credits were out of place imo).","displayName":"Dane M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-14T14:52:12.155Z","updateDate":"2019-12-14T14:52:27.191Z","user":{"userId":"978248679","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dane M","accountLink":"/user/id/978248679"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I liked it a little better than the first one. I didn’t feel disconnected with the characters at all because I felt they did a good job in bridging the previous movie with this one to keep a storyline.

The songs are too plentiful.  At least they waited 10 or more minutes to have the first one.  The animation is so real it begs the question why not use REAL actors?  The story is blasee.
