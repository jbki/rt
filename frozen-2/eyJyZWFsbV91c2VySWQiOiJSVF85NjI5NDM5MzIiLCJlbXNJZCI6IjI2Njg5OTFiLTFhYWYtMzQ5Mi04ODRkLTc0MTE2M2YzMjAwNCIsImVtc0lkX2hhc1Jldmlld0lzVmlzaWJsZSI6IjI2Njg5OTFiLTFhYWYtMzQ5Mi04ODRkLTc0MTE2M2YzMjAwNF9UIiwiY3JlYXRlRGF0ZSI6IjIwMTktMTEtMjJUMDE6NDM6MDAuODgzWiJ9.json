I have to say I enjoyed this one better than the first Frozen. One of my favorites things and I like to see are the little things that happen in the background during a main scene. That's the stuff that cracks me up and what makes Olaf steal the show. No one could pull up Olaf like Josh Gad. The storyline was good and the music was strong. Definitely worth watching.","displayName":"Sheila S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10154032163765116/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T01:27:58.200Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T01:30:36.850Z","user":{"userId":"977963938","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sheila S","accountLink":"/user/id/977963938"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The kids loved it.
