The first one is remembered as so great because it stood out from Disney movies of that time and it established some great characters. This one really surprised me as a very solid sequel. Anna was a little too obsessed with her sister and blew off Kristoff too much and that was just kind of brushed aside with him being understanding . . . Again. But Anna being willing to make that sacrifice was awesome. Kind of wish Arendale had been destroyed and they had to rebuild to make it a true sacrifice but it is a kids movie. Loved the music. Might not be as big as Let it Go but honestly the other songs in the first movie were not that great. This one has several really catchy songs. Anna was a lot more mature when talking to Elsa than she was in the first one but seems Elsa still has some room to grow. Which is pretty believable considering. Just wish Anna was as mature with Kristoff. And there was less trolls so that is a win. A fantastic sequel and a great movie. I want to watch it again.","displayName":"Ashley P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000451158941/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T00:52:16.474Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T00:52:25.281Z","user":{"userId":"908144597","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ashley P","accountLink":"/user/id/908144597"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"More singing than action","displayName":"Adelle","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T00:47:37.759Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T00:47:37.759Z","user":{"userId":"847EA247-1B1B-458B-AF12-5D61DFA9973B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Adelle","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I was amazed how Frozen II interweaved with the original Frozen.  In the original film I couldn't understand why the opening music was used - this was explained in Frozen II.  The songs/music were very good.  The whole film was insightful, entertaining and very well done.  It was fun to hear the young children laughing a Olaf - the could connect with him.  Excellent film!","displayName":"PJerryDurant","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T00:23:09.607Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T00:23:09.607Z","user":{"userId":"4d4087ee-b243-4512-8d6e-07236d3dcf06","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"PJerryDurant","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I personally liked it a little more than the 1st installment. The message sent, IMO, that most of the time the answers we seek are often within us and we already know it. We are stronger than we are willing to let ourselves be. I also enjoyed the infusion of the 80s style rock love ballad. There was a bit of a Les Miserable feel as well.","displayName":"Nathan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T00:16:39.389Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T00:21:06.989Z","user":{"userId":"a0baa70e-8e61-4398-adb0-febaefa6ebc1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Nathan","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love frozen 2, it was so cute and all the kids and adults we enjoyed it.","displayName":"margo","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T00:12:50.756Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T00:12:50.756Z","user":{"userId":"2125ee2c-09e0-46da-8dec-b34a8818e303","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"margo","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I dont like kids movies but i took my grandson and he loved it!","displayName":"Bill J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/130438465094407/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T00:04:04.816Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T00:04:15.791Z","user":{"userId":"978499456","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bill J","accountLink":"/user/id/978499456"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"1d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was really good.
