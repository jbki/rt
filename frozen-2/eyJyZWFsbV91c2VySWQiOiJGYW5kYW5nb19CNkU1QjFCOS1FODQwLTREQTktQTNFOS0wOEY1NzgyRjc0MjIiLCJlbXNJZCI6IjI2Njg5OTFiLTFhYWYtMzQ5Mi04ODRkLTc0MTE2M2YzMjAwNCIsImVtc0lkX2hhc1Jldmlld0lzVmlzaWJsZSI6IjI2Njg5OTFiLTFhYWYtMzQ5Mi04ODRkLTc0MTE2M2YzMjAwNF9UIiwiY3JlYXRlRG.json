You have to take Kristoff's song in one of two ways to like it: appreciate the homage to 80's rock, or recognize that it's giving boys a role model that is allowed to feel and yearn. At its heart, though, Frozen is of the two sisters. \"Show Yourself\" was the most delightful surprise: it was an absolute marvel and the pinnacle of emotion, music, and cinematography. Anna has her own climax, but it's a quieter, poignant thing: a victory, but not a triumphant one. It ends defiantly, shining with Anna's strength, and an amusing parallel to the last movie. This movie ends with my wanting 20 more minutes of the ending, but that's similar to how I felt foe the first one. The difference, I think, for this movie is that there are so many little details, it is all too easy to miss something. But that also means there's new discoveries for every rewatch, and I definitely want to watch this again.","displayName":"Jeralyn G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2439751562930429/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-13T00:39:27.559Z","updateDate":"2019-12-13T00:39:43.985Z","user":{"userId":"978428920","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeralyn G","accountLink":"/user/id/978428920"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved that it spoke on finding out the truth and making sacrifices","displayName":"Lovelle","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-13T00:34:41.674Z","updateDate":"2019-12-13T00:34:41.674Z","user":{"userId":"91f552c7-b65e-4f73-bb97-58db683c425b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Lovelle","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Better than the first one.
