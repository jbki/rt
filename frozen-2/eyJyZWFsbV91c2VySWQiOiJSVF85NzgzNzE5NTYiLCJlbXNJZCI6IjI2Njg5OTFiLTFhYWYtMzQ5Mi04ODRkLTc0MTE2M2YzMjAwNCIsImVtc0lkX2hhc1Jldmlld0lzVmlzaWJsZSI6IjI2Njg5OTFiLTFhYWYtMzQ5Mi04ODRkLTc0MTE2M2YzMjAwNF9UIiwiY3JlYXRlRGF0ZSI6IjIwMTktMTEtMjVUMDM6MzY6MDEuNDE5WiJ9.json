Disney knows the recipe for these films and mixed up a credible combination of animation, story line and song. However, it was missing the \"magic\" of the first movie. Young girls will love it simply because it has Elsa and Anna, and that is probably good enough. Elsa looks a little ashen and could use to eat a sandwich. Anna is cute as ever. Olaf is annoying as ever and Christopher is still dumb as a rock. But this is all from an adult perspective. I enjoyed the first movie for the music. Frozen II delivered some cute songs but the Elsa aria was not quite as dramatic and the vocals didn't soar to the same crescendos. But, it is a Disney cartoon, so there you are.","displayName":"Ken","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T03:28:03.176Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T03:28:03.176Z","user":{"userId":"353652c9-b9a4-42e8-90ec-7ac4c94f2134","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ken","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good story fit in with the first movie","displayName":"Bruce F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T03:26:35.314Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T03:26:36.351Z","user":{"userId":"d7ad076b-78cc-48ee-8178-1436c1b77d4b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bruce F","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Absolutely blown away. If you are a fan of epic fantasy storylines, this is your type of movie. The relationship between the sisters is still front and center. The lore of the frozen universe is greatly expanded in this movie, building up on it more than the little bit that was shown in the first movie. The ending in this one is definitely more bittersweet (but still more sweet than bitter). One of the best parts of the Frozen franchise are themes of overcoming sorrow and doubt, and this movie delivers stronger than the first. Obviously if you’re looking for a happy go lucky comedy please look elsewhere.","displayName":"DT","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T03:25:39.193Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T03:25:39.193Z","user":{"userId":"20E6964E-CA7C-428D-A089-F0B4E60362A8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"DT","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Visually and musically beautiful","displayName":"Ashley","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T03:24:16.240Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T03:24:16.240Z","user":{"userId":"523E9331-7BA0-48B1-9CEF-C887555AD110","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ashley","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wonderful music, excellent animation!","displayName":"Google","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T03:23:41.984Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T03:23:41.984Z","user":{"userId":"f78ebbca-65f5-431b-aa03-de3e74550237","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Google","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie!
