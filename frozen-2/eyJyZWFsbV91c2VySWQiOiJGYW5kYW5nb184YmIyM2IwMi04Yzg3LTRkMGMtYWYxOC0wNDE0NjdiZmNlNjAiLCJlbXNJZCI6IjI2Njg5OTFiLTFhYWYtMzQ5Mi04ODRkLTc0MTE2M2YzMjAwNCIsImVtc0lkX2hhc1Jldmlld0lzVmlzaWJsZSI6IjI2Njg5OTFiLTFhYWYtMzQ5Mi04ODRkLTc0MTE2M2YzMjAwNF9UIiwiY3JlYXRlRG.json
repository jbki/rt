Left so many unanswered questions in the first movie. Why does this chick have powers etc. perfect set up for the sequel. \nI laughed. I cried.

The steaks are shown about 1/3 of the way in and are resolved very close to the closing moments of the movie.  \n\nThere is a sub plot that is played up one to many times in the film that keeps it from having a perfect plot.  It drags down the movie in one very obvious spot and I have to mark it down for that moment.  \n\nAll in all i feel this movie was actually a bit better than Frozen 1.  \n\nA Definite must see this holiday season.","displayName":"Kevin D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002037077603/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T08:28:39.384Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T08:28:50.866Z","user":{"userId":"920312662","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kevin D","accountLink":"/user/id/920312662"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I went with my girlfriend, she loved it but it honestly felt like a cash grab to me. The story felt like a standard sequel where they just add old character nostalgia and the plot consists of \"Oh wow, this part of town never existed until now!\" and then adventure ensues. The only thing I mildly enjoyed was the \"lost in the woods\" song b/c it had this old 90s/early 2000s rock vibe to it that I can't describe but I really enjoyed.","displayName":"Jose C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T07:35:03.259Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T07:35:13.669Z","user":{"userId":"977871417","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jose C","accountLink":"/user/id/977871417"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Its the best thats all I can say","displayName":"Xee","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T07:25:15.277Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T07:25:15.277Z","user":{"userId":"f6d2fa97-22ed-4042-a294-66b193381072","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Xee","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing in all ways.
