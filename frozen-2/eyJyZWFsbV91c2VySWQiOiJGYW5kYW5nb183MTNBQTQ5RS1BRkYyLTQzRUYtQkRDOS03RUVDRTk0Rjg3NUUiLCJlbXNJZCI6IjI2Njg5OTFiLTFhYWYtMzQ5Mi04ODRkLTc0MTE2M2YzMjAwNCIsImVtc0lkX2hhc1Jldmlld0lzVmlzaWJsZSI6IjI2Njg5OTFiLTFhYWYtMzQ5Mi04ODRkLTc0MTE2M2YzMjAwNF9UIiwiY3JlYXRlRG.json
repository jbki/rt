The music was fine and I would say on par to the last film. What stands out is Christoph's 80's ballad which parents will laugh at the absurdity and love it at the same time. They try to put some lore into this franchise and Elsa and Anna's parents played a bigger role than the previous film. Like the first one, it's a journey of self-discovery and overcoming fear. I felt the action scenes were more rushed and there were not a lot of emphases put on the elementals as I'd like. The one that got the most attention was water due to Elsa's powers.\n\nMaybe I'm comparing it to the first movie too much but i think it's even with the first one and i wouldn't mind seeing it again once it comes out on Disney+.","displayName":"David R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T05:22:23.627Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T05:22:26.311Z","user":{"userId":"957271885","realm":"RT","displayName":"David R","accountLink":"/user/id/957271885"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I liked it.
