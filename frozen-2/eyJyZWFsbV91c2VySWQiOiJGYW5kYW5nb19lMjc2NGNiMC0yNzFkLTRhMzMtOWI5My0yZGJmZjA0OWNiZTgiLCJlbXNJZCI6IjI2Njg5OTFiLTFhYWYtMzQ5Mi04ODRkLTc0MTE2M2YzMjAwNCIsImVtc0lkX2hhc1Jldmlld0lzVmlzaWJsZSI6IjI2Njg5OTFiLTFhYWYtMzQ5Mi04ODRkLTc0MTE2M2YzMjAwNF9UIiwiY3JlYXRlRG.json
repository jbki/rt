Well, we reeeaaally loosely adapted Snow Queen and so we cant pull from that, I know well make it an origin story for Elsas powers, as well as a tale of righting intergenerational wrongs against indigenous people. Also throw in an 80s power ballad with a reindeer chorus, because why not? Great lessons for kids—accepting change, doing the right thing, its okay to feel emotions—if they can stay focused. It might be long and complex for children. Better music than the first film but a lot of music. Really a fantasy for adults thats okay for kids, too.","displayName":"Thu-Han T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T00:45:53.528Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T00:45:53.528Z","user":{"userId":"0ae2feb0-ced4-404e-b843-6703ef145c68","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Thu-Han T","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great story and music!","displayName":"Ashley","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T00:45:04.840Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T00:45:04.840Z","user":{"userId":"3abd1c0c-4771-4715-893a-c42afce52c83","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ashley","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I loved, enjoy they had more action, was wonderful","displayName":"Fantastic","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T00:44:47.573Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T00:44:47.573Z","user":{"userId":"f79daa67-ed90-4bac-afe1-6df524e00c77","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Fantastic","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The movie was great!
