It has no epic memorable songs like \"Let it Go\", plot is weak, and it is saturated with too many songs.  Back when there were video stores this would be a straight to video movie.  It is a cross between The Fifth Element, the cartoon Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Force 10 From Navarone.  I asked my kids if they remember any songs and the answer was no.  I recommend waiting till it is at Redbox.","displayName":"The one G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T23:56:24.945Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T17:53:00.374Z","user":{"userId":"976948671","realm":"RT","displayName":"The one G","accountLink":"/user/id/976948671"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love everything about it was a Great job I  absolutely love ‚ù§Ô∏è magnify work.","displayName":"Besha","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T23:50:10.403Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T23:50:10.403Z","user":{"userId":"FF435468-FE89-4AFC-BF51-6CFA48AB3172","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Besha","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"it was ok, but not like number one, I don't think that is going to be in my collection of movies","displayName":"Dunja","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T23:47:43.533Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T23:47:43.533Z","user":{"userId":"4ED3671C-67F0-4ACE-B6E5-A3F59586ABBE","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dunja","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved the movie.
