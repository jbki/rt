OMG it was so hard to sit through this convoluted contrived piece of tripe.  When you have a story you can't make sense out of, combined with trickley god awful songs every two minutes, yep, it's hard to sit through.  It started out slow and I kept waiting for it to click, but it never did.  So... what do Anna, Elsa, Sven, Kristoff, and Olaf do for fun after the last movie?  They sit on the sofa and play charades of course.  Oh brother is what I kept saying to myself during this one.  Over and over. That and WTF trying to make sense of the cockamamie story line.  Absolutely didn't care for it.  I won't go on because I want to forget I saw it lol.  Eeeesh!  A huge thumbs down for me.  I was really dissapointed because I loved the first film.","displayName":"Kyle C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002965672730/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T04:23:01.175Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T04:23:19.270Z","user":{"userId":"945812260","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kyle C","accountLink":"/user/id/945812260"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Better than the first movie!!","displayName":"Laura","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T04:22:38.388Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T04:22:38.388Z","user":{"userId":"4718455d-a497-40b6-807a-d8ea0011270b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Laura","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"}]}
