Nothing higher or greater than you is possible - YOU are the god in your own story. \n\nLet's make Kristoff into a beta male whose only purpose is to support Anna in her mania (\"my love isn't fragile\" - insinuating that a REAL man takes backseat to his destructive & illogical female partner). \n\nRounding out with the over-arching theme of white civilization = bad, indigenous forests dwellers = good. \n\nIllogical feminists have ruined another family favorite through their attempts at indoctrination. We were not the only parents who stopped several times during this movie to look around at each other with a silent \"did they really just do that?\" \n\nParents, pay close attention to the themes you need to undo with your children if you allow them to see this.","displayName":"Kristina","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T17:28:08.069Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T17:28:08.069Z","user":{"userId":"31c9f360-31a1-43e7-942f-14534ab9ea63","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kristina","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Its a good family movie with a lot of songs.","displayName":"Crystal","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T17:26:25.612Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T17:26:25.612Z","user":{"userId":"01d54229-cfb0-4afd-b86c-a4964586a865","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Crystal","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Never expect two much on an animated sequel.

Suffers from the same issues as the first movie only its magnified here. Pacing is slow, characters are dull, and things happen in the movie without any real explanation except for the movie wants it to happen. I'd say the first is a better movie but this one is at least more rewatchable.","displayName":"Jude Ceant","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T17:17:44.751Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T17:17:44.751Z","user":{"userId":"C337FA4B-C8FB-4072-A049-33FFFA7350E3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jude Ceant","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I was surprised that it was so good even though it was a sequel.
