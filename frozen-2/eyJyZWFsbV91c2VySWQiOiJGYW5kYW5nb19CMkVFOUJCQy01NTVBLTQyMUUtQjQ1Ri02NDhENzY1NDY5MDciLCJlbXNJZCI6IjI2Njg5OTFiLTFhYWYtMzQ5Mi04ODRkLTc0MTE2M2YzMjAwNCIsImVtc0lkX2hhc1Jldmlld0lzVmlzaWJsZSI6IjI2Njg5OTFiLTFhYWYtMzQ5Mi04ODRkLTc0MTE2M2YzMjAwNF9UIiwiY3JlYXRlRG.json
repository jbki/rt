Only reason I’m not giving it a 5/5 is because I felt that it was almost too fast paced and we didn’t get to see a lot of the new characters. Also was a bit cliche at times. On the positive side, it was definitely more sophisticated than Frozen. The songs were spectacular and the comedy is beyond funny. When comparing Frozen to Frozen 2, it’s difficult to say which one is better. On one hand, Frozen knows exactly what it is and presents it in a simple and fulfilling way, where as I felt Frozen 2 was more confusing and complex than it had to be. However, Frozen 2 is a better movie in terms of theatrics and even entertainment. All in all, I would highly recommend.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T02:03:36.562Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T02:03:42.084Z","user":{"userId":"260337112","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260337112"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"We love it!
