Now I am sure, if I did that, I wouldn't have enjoyed the movie as much as I have. \nUnlike many others I loved this movie and I will even say its better than the first. It gives our beloved protagonists so much more depth, it tells the story about their past and it brings us to new lands. I dont understand why you would ask questions like \"why wasnt any of this mentioned in the first movie?\" to a childrens movie. Have you people ever watched more than three childrens movies? There is always some form of \"oh that thing happened in their past!\" like Ursulas sister in Arielle 2, who came from the unknown, but apparently is very powerful too. \nBack to Frozen II: it has a refreshing new kind of storytelling, there is no bad-guy and there is no single-streamed story where everyone is together and they save the world. Every single one of our beloved protagonists are given a deep personality and you can clearly tell that some songs (Kristoffs \"Lost in the Woods\" and Olafs \"When I'm older\" in particular) were made for the adults rather than the children, which for me as an adult is a huuuuuge plus side. Disney noticed they had a huge adult fanbase aswell and they adapted. \nYes the story isnt like older Disney movies, yes the songs are something new aswell and YES the movie is the best Disney has produced IN YEARS. I absolutely loved it and you should really give this movie a second chance by watching is as an adult rather than a grown up child (not meant as offence)! :)","displayName":"Alessandra T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3118211791525680/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T12:08:37.072Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T12:08:43.239Z","user":{"userId":"978500465","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alessandra T","accountLink":"/user/id/978500465"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"18h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"To keep it simple, the follow up to Frozen is disappointing. It seems much more interested in the magic and world building of Arendelle than it is in character development. Character decisions are rash and undeveloped. Several times does a character make a crucial decision that should alter their entire future with no thought whatsoever (Looking at you Anna). In the original Frozen, we saw Elsa accept her powers for what they are and stop \"shutting the world out\" and we saw Anna lose the naivety that came from being shut in a castle. In this film, the characters' personalities remain the same. \n\nEssentially, the character and relationship development that I loved about the first movie is entirely missing in this one. However, you are still likely to enjoy the experience if you are interest primarily in magic and fancy graphics.\n\nPS. Sven, Olaf, and especially Kristoff are completely wasted in this adventure.","displayName":"Martin20 D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-03T11:16:43.827Z","updateDate":"2020-01-03T11:16:50.345Z","user":{"userId":"977718482","realm":"RT","displayName":"Martin20 D","accountLink":"/user/id/977718482"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"19h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing !!!
