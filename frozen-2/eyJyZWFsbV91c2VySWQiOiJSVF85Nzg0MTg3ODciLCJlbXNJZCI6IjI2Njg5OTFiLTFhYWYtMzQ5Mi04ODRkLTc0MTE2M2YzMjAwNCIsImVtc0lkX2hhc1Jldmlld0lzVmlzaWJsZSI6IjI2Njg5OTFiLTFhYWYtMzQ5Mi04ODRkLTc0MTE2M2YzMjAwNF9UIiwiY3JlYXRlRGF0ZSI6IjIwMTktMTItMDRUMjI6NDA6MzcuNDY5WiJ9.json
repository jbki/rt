Olaf was hilarious, just like in the first movie. And many of the scenes were visually stunning. But I was disappointed in the complicated story line that needed a L-O-N-G narrative introduction to understand it, and how it included several political issues such as the racial conflict between Native Americans and Caucasian Americans or environmental issues regarding the dam. Did they really need to bring those issues into a kid's movie to make it a best seller?","displayName":"Dennis W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T20:15:04.189Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T20:15:04.189Z","user":{"userId":"E54D57EE-F5E6-405C-A5E6-586188ED6F80","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Dennis W","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was really good.My kiddos loved it!","displayName":"Brady","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T20:08:35.244Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T20:08:35.244Z","user":{"userId":"4B615235-2284-42B2-BDD2-E62E3FAA6712","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Brady","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"absolutely loved it!!!","displayName":"Phillip","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T19:27:54.301Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T19:27:54.301Z","user":{"userId":"5638107D-F94C-4E39-9CF6-1477B78F8D3C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Phillip","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"}]}
