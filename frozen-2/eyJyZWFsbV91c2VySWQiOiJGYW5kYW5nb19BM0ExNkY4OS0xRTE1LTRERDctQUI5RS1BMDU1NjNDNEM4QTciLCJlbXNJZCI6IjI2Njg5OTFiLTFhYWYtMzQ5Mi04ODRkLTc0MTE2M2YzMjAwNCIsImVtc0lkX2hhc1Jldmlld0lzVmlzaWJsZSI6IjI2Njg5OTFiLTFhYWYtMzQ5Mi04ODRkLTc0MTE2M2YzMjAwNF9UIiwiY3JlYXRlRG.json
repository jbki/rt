The ending of it was terrible. I liked the first Frozen better and was really looking forward to seeing this sequel when I went to go to see it. It did not meet my expectations and I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. I mean really? Splitting the 2 sisters up? Having one become the protector of the enchanted forest and the other the new ruler of Arendelle? That WAS what ruined the entire movie for me. And the only 1 good song in this whole entire movie was Into The Unknown. I am disappointed in Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck. This movie does not deserve a Frozen 3 if they plan to make another.","displayName":"Chelsea A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-06T05:39:15.403Z","updateDate":"2019-12-06T05:39:21.003Z","user":{"userId":"971321862","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chelsea A","accountLink":"/user/id/971321862"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Disney did it again!
