I personally prefer this film over the first! So much adventure and so much more magic! I feel more connected to the characters and understand all their emotions throughout the whole film. Theyre all relatable and unique in their own ways. From beginning to end, I was on my toes! I was so curious as to what would happen next and didnt want the movie to end! The music was AMAZING and the costumes were BEAUTIFUL!  Its a perfect sequel and deserves much more attention and hype as the first one. Definitely my favorite film this year. Going back to see it a couple more times. Go see it!","displayName":"Serge","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T08:08:41.648Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T08:08:41.648Z","user":{"userId":"233e3f40-5273-4e12-a21a-95ad4a75668a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Serge","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I felt that this movie was much better than the first one. The writing is stronger and told a much better story from beginning to end where I felt the first one lost momentum halfway through and showed that it clearly went through more rewrites to shoehorn in a surprise villain. Though the songs are not as catchy as the first film, I felt that they were still good songs that felt reminiscent of a musical and helped further the story and allowed the characters to express their feelings in those moments. I love the musical score much more in this sequel and found the melodies more memorable than those in the first. Overall I thought that this was a fantastic sequel and a must see for Disney fans.","displayName":"Rachel R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2692073467508417/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T07:56:45.808Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T07:56:51.397Z","user":{"userId":"978405180","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rachel R","accountLink":"/user/id/978405180"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I was great!!
