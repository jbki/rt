The songs arent that great the first ones songs worked with the movie but in this one the songs were made to fit the movie and kristoffs song really ... should of been left out. Disney disappointed with this one. We saw it the first night it released in theaters and my five year old was so excited but I have to say that it really needed a better story.  Basically Elsa finds out why she has powers, Anna saves the day and gets engaged and becomes the new queen. -.- their was some funny moments but not enough of them.... I wish Disney had gone a different direction and I probably wont buy it when it comes to dvd unless my kid insists.","displayName":"Shannon S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T19:04:03.568Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T19:04:03.568Z","user":{"userId":"f2c1f787-bc06-47a7-9d54-3ad30ba036a0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Shannon S","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Alot of singing but it‚Äôs good.","displayName":"graciela","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T19:02:17.309Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T19:07:58.893Z","user":{"userId":"37F1E544-70F5-4D21-9F3B-C3EFE86CB29E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"graciela","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great movie. Though it did feel kinda rushed near the end, I assume they were cutting time to prevent the movie going too long. Though it would be the best if they had the longer time in order to explain certain plot points which was a bit too brief. But overall I came for the music and it doesn't disappoint. Emotional moments were realistic and well executed. 8/10.","displayName":"Alan T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T19:01:45.826Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T19:01:58.447Z","user":{"userId":"964385355","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alan T","accountLink":"/user/id/964385355"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Awesome family movie.
