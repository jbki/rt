I don't get it when some bad criticism says this movie is lack of a villain, that's how deep we are bound to expect traditional movies which were built in a format to \"fit in\". Frozen II is not that kind of a traditional movie, it breaks so many rigid concepts and expectations on so many levels! There were lots of scenes in the movie, when I saw them I immediately knew what it could mean to the next generation of audience. Similarly, in real life there won't necessarily always be a \"villain\" who can make you easily tell what is right or wrong, most of the time it's just categorized by circumstances. This movie is so under-rated, it should at least be a 95%+.","displayName":"Stephanie C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2527355627508393/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T16:01:41.187Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T16:01:51.600Z","user":{"userId":"978412551","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stephanie C","accountLink":"/user/id/978412551"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great mix of humor for kids and adults.","displayName":"Tami","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T15:58:40.099Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T15:58:40.099Z","user":{"userId":"42525627-bf0e-4d1b-85f7-c2d4ec788105","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tami","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it as much as my girls","displayName":"Vanessa","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T15:57:08.338Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T15:57:08.338Z","user":{"userId":"741ED176-2E13-4BB3-BCDA-449774EEEB7A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Vanessa","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"wonderful movie, kids loved it","displayName":"Facebook U","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T15:54:16.186Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T03:09:11.053Z","user":{"userId":"EDD3222D-C127-4262-98B7-20F617A6C47B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Facebook U","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Dark and deep.
