Disney has done it again. Critics seem to be somewhat mixed on this film, but I have to say, I like it better than the original! Elsa is a definite standout, heads up, your kids will sing a particular song that definitely tries to recapture let it go. The songs weren't as memorable as the first, but that one I mentioned definitely is. Anna is doing well in this film too. Sven is more enjoyable this time around for me, and Olaf is a lovable charm of humor! Kristof is definitely underused in this film. His subplot is definitely funny and interesting, but does start to drag. Along with these characters, plenty of new characters are in this and each one is great and definitely interesting... but lacking in screen time. This movie really builds on the Frozen world and universe. I love that! It's done so well and it's integrated so deep into the plot, and that each twist and turn feels earned! There is a lot to say about the parents of Anna and Else, because they aren't actually  what they seem, and they do play a major role in the overall story. Aside from the minor nitpicks like the underuse of Kristof, and not as catchy songs, this movie is a definite win and must watch! Solid A for me.","displayName":"Aiden R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-15T17:08:30.800Z","updateDate":"2019-12-15T17:08:35.271Z","user":{"userId":"977308243","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aiden R","accountLink":"/user/id/977308243"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good continuation, new story bloomed same voices and characters.
