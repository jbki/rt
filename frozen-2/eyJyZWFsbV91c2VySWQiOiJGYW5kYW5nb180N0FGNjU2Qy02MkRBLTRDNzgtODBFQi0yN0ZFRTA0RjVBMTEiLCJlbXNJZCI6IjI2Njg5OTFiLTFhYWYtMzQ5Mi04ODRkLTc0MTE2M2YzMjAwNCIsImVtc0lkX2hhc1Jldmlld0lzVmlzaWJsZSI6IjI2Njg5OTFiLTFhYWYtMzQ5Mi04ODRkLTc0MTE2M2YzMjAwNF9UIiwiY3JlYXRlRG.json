The humor in this film was 100 times better than the first one. Now I think that we might need to check on Olaf's back because he CARRIED the humor in this film. He was hilarious. I appreciated how most of the jokes that weren't from Olaf were making fun of the first movie which was funny. Now onto my main gripe with the film: the plot conflict. The conflict in this movie was incredibly hard to follow and was way to complex for a children's movie. I understand that this movie was made with older audiences in mind, but as a 16-year old, I quite frankly was lost with the conflict. The plot conflict was just bad. Now the bottom bun of the sandwich: I thought the music in this film was superior to the first one. It wasn't just Anna and Elsa singing, all four of the main characters had their chance to sing which added a really cool aspect to the film.  So overall I would say that Frozen II gets an 8.2 out of 10 on the Right Scale.","displayName":"Henry R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T23:27:12.544Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T23:28:45.198Z","user":{"userId":"977600915","realm":"RT","displayName":"Henry R","accountLink":"/user/id/977600915"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Frozen 2 is the best movie on earth I love it","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T22:46:51.514Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T22:46:51.514Z","user":{"userId":"260341971","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260341971"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I *need* more of this in my life. Frozen II is exactly the kind of awesome, captivating younger-audience epic fantasy I love. It reminds me so much of stuff like Steven Universe and Gravity Falls and the like.\n\nIt hits the exact right tone that I was hoping for when the teaser trailer was released, but it's not what I actually expected the film to be. The storytelling and tone are mature in the same way Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King are, but the story goes even deeper than Disney normally goes. Yet it's still a pretty simple story that's easy for kids to follow. It's the perfect segway for kids when you want to introduce them to something like Lord of the Rings later on.\n\nI'm a little confused about how Disney is promoting the music. First of all, it didn't feel like it was meant to be a musical. That's not to say any of the songs were bad, just that they kind of felt like an obligation and didn't mesh as well with the story as in the first film.\n\nBut also, I really don't get why \"Into the Unknown\" is the big song they're pushing. I guess it's only because \"Show Yourself\" would be too spoiler-y? I'm hoping the latter was at least submitted for the Oscars, 'cause that deserves the nod more.\n\nAnd honestly, I know it was just supposed to be a joke song, but \"Lost in the Woods\" is by far the best on the soundtrack. They accidentally wrote a fantastic 90's bop.\n\nI loved the growth of the characters, and I really want to see more of it in the future. The movie made me desperately want an cable-style animated series on Disney+. Something with a ton of depth and mood that still captures that Disney Magic. Give Jennifer Lee something like that and it could be incredible.","displayName":"Ametrine A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T22:44:33.779Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T22:44:40.340Z","user":{"userId":"976495393","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ametrine A","accountLink":"/user/id/976495393"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Uh just passing Like what was the point of this story like it seems it was just a way to introduce some stuff for the sequel Also no movie needs 7 songs ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T22:34:35.125Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T22:34:35.125Z","user":{"userId":"260341969","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260341969"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"It was painful to sit through. The story was like someone tossed a bunch of ideas in a bag and then spilled them all over the floor. The songs were like musical ramblings without catchy structures, and rarely earned by an emotional moment. Visually beautiful but the hours and talent spent on it could have been invested into a much better story. I liked the first one, but this was dog doo.","displayName":"Jess W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T22:31:04.203Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T22:31:09.687Z","user":{"userId":"977710673","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jess W","accountLink":"/user/id/977710673"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it and so did my kids.
