More fun than the original, but that may be because the original was played out before Christmas. Went in thinking theyd somehow make Olaf irritatingly obnoxious.

The film is much funnier than the first and truly felt like it could end the series (thank you!) by having each character have their own incredible moments or moment. I recommend.","displayName":"casey","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T00:25:36.516Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T00:25:36.516Z","user":{"userId":"11ef3da9-2e52-45c2-b3ef-d6b20cc70665","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"casey","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Visually stunning.
