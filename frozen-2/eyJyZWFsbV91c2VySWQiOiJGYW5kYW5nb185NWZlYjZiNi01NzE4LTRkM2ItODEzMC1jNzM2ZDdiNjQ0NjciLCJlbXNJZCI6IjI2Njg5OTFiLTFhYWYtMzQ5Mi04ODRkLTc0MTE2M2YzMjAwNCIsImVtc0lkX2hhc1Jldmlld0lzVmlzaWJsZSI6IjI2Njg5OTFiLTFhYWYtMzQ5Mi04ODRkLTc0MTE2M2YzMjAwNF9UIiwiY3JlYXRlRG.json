I'm in love with the effects for this film. The story works in well with the first movie and helps explain a lot of the lore. It does feel like some songs were kind of crammed in where they really dont need to be.

In the original, the storyline was simple and clean. In the sequel, its quite muddled. Were jumping all over the place, the why now? is never addressed, and I wouldve expected the animation to blow me away like Toy Story 4 did, alas, it did not. Still, an enjoyable film. But Frozen I, it is not.","displayName":"Markus G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T05:15:40.882Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T05:15:40.882Z","user":{"userId":"38fd86c0-68f1-438c-97f8-6b859c871aa1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Markus G","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Nothing compared to the first one.
