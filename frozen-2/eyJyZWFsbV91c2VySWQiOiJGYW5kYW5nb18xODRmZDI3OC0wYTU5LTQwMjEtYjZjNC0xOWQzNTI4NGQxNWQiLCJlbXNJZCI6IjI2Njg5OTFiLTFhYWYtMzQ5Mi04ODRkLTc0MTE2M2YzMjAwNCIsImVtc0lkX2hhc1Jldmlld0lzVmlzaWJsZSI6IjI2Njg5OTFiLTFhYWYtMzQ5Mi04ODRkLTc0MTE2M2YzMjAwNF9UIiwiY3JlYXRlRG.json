Even though Frozen 2 may not have a climax as high as that of Let It Go, it has greater quality across the board with the rousing anthem Into the Unknown, emotional depth in Show Yourself, and rock ballad Lost in the Woods. The Next Right Thing is equally moving, if not heartbreaking.\nThirdly, the messages of Frozen 2 are deeper than Frozen. Frozen 2 teaches about finding yourself, boys can show their emotions too, and doing the right thing, one decision at a time. The Next Right Thing is amazing in the way that it is heartbreaking, but filled with hope. Anna realises that she can do the next right thing and move on even after losing Elsa and Anna. In real life, just doing the next right thing, one step at a time, is equally important.\nAll in all, Frozen 2 has greater emotional depth, an equally good or even better soundtrack, and stunning animations to go. It is a must watch.","displayName":"Pika L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/510629089665615/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T06:53:03.148Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T03:49:08.963Z","user":{"userId":"978403549","realm":"RT","displayName":"Pika L","accountLink":"/user/id/978403549"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's a Disney Classic with all the feels that come along with what you expect from the Brand.","displayName":"Darryl","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T06:52:15.593Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T06:52:15.593Z","user":{"userId":"2721E696-FC7C-47AC-92F9-A90EDAA286DB","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Darryl","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Fun movie.

For a sequel it really did better than most and I can definitely see myself rewatching this several times when it is released. Thoroughly enjoyable and I'm not sure which one has better songs to be honest, the new songs were just gorgeous.","displayName":"Cat G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10100184414035000/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T06:42:55.983Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T06:43:00.188Z","user":{"userId":"971507785","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cat G","accountLink":"/user/id/971507785"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"}]}
