It kind of fucks up a few characters, it made Olaf less funny and made him annoying. In the first movie, i laughed and giggled, but here its just like he was put in the movie just to sell toys. The plot was boring and the only appeal to me are the songs. So to me, this movie is just a waste of time and money","displayName":"Nadhif S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-18T23:14:52.238Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T23:14:57.956Z","user":{"userId":"978413491","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nadhif S","accountLink":"/user/id/978413491"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"As usual the sequel fails to capture the magic of the original. It lacked depth in the story line, including a lot of plot holes, and it had too many main characters. I feel like they rushed it and came up with a poorly developed story line. Even the songs were disappointing. I was even more disappointed because Frozen 1 ranked up with my favorite all time Disney films, alongside Beauty and the Beast. I personally am not going to purchase Frozen 2 and am going to pretend this film didn’t exist. Honestly I’m probably being over critical because I anticipated something at least close to Frozen.","displayName":"Ben","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-18T23:12:34.662Z","updateDate":"2019-12-18T23:12:34.662Z","user":{"userId":"5DBCD707-D214-4801-B278-159BCF6C85EE","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ben","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was phenomenal!!
