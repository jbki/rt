The whole thing was so odd. Even my three year old looked at me and said, \"I don't like this movie\". Every song was so weird- why was the main song about how Elsa hears voices in her head? Olaf spent the entire time having an existential crisis. Anna would not stop nagging Elsa. Elsa made it clear she learned none of the lessons from the first movie by literally pushing her sister away  AGAIN. In the end we learn that Elsa is awesome, sexy and powerful. She gets to meet her mom and have super powers. The only power Anna has it to be nagging and dismissive of her amazing boyfriend. \n\nThe straight to DVD Frozen movie about Christmas was far-superior to this downer.","displayName":"Wesley A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1041810411/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-27T05:14:50.254Z","updateDate":"2019-12-27T05:14:57.618Z","user":{"userId":"910161231","realm":"RT","displayName":"Wesley A","accountLink":"/user/id/910161231"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"AMAZING!!!
