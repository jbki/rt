This definitely wasnt one of those tried-too-hard sequels. \nThe story was well-written, engaging, and funny. I loved how they wove in the past and revealed so much history. \nHowever, it wasnt perfect. The songs were meh. They were pretty songs, but they arent the fun, sing-along songs like we got from the first movie. \nAlso, the credits said Idina Menzel voices Elsa, but it did not sound like her at all.","displayName":"Kimberly R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T13:27:19.641Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T13:27:19.641Z","user":{"userId":"4da061db-550c-4e45-8193-ea19b6197109","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kimberly R","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fantabulous!
