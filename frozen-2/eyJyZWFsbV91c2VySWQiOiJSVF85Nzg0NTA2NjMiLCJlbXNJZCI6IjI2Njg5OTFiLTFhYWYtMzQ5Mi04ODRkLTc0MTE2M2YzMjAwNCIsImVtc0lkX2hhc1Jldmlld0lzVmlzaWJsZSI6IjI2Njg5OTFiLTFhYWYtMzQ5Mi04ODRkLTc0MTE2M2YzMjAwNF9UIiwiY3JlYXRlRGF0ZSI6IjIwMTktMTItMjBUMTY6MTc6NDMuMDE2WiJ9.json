I gleened the plot but there still seemed to be elements that didn't match up or seemed like some things were cut from the final product. overall my children loved it and the music was superior to the first.

The plot tends to rely on magic without explanation, but the sisters both get some great development in this one.  I found Kristoff's number to be entertaining but very out of place and jarring to the flow of the film.  The animation is absolutely beautiful and worth the ticket for that alone.  Weirdly very influenced by Avatar TLA (in a good way).","displayName":"Ian G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1474846264/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T15:11:58.636Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T15:12:02.213Z","user":{"userId":"953730715","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ian G","accountLink":"/user/id/953730715"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Confusing yet foreseeable, dark yet without real consequences, Elsaâ€˜s storyline unfortunately overshadows the otherwise great overall character work, inspired songwriting and hilarious script.","displayName":"Korbinian W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001278919594/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T15:07:10.256Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T15:07:11.832Z","user":{"userId":"904796273","realm":"RT","displayName":"Korbinian W","accountLink":"/user/id/904796273"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The songs were lackluster but the plot was good","displayName":"Ashley","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T15:00:15.885Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T15:00:15.885Z","user":{"userId":"69E86852-1511-46E5-AB6F-AAF35F021AC2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ashley","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was great even better than the 1st","displayName":"jerome s","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T14:57:11.680Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T14:57:15.290Z","user":{"userId":"977184349","realm":"RT","displayName":"jerome s","accountLink":"/user/id/977184349"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
