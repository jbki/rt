My 6 year old daughter and 4 year old son were truly invested 100% in the movie. My 3 year old daughter would lose interest every now and then. But we come home and play the sound track every morning before we start our day and she is the loudest singing at the top of her little lungs. She loves the music 100%. I would say the movie is for older kids..4+ (my son is almost 5y). My husband watched the whole movie and said it was, \"ok\". Which I mean usually he falls asleep for any kids movies. So I say 5 stars⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","displayName":"Sophia K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T04:50:23.701Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T04:50:23.701Z","user":{"userId":"978438408","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sophia K","accountLink":"/user/id/978438408"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Frozen 2 was a great movie  the kids in the theater were laughing and enjoying the movie also","displayName":"Robert","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T04:48:32.132Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T04:48:32.132Z","user":{"userId":"1bf6d5f5-a1a2-4d23-b95e-9dca5d752a15","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Robert","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What a wonderful family film.

The story was solid as well,easy enough for kids to follow while complex enough to intrigue adults, and it didn't rely -too- heavily on the first film to build off of, as well as answering many questions from the first. Overall, great sequel as far as Disney goes.","displayName":"Stephanie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T04:18:05.157Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T04:18:05.157Z","user":{"userId":"1534e01b-1444-45f2-85c3-3223cac75b9f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Stephanie","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great!

Soooo much worse than the first one. I went with my wife and two kids and all of us agreed immediately it's the worst anime for years!!  Very weak story, no new characters, no twist... they should've made new villains from other elements. And way too many songs that are pointless! The prince got lost in the wood and sang a song?! He literally said that he knows the woods! Come on! The worst part is Elsa found herself to be a spirit??!!
