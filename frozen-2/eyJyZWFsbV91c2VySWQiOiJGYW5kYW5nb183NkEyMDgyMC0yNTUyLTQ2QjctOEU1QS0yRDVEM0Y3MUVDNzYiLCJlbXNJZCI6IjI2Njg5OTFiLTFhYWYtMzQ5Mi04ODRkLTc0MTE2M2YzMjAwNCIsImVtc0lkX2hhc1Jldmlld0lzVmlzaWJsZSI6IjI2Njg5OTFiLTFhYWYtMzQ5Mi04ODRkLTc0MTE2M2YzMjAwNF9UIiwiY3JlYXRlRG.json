I really liked the story and the character development of Elsa, Ana and Olaf. I did feel like Christoph was left behind and not expanded well this time. Also, some of the songs felt out of place and even weakened the overall story, like they were rushed for completion and thrown in. I did really like the ending and the story twist during the journey.","displayName":"Kim","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T04:29:15.528Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T04:29:15.528Z","user":{"userId":"E42123BF-50B6-401D-8BCD-D799EF0D39F8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kim","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Frozen 2 was really good","displayName":"Nick V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T04:28:59.662Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T04:29:03.473Z","user":{"userId":"978167732","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nick V","accountLink":"/user/id/978167732"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Convoluted story, music was nowhere near as good as the first.
