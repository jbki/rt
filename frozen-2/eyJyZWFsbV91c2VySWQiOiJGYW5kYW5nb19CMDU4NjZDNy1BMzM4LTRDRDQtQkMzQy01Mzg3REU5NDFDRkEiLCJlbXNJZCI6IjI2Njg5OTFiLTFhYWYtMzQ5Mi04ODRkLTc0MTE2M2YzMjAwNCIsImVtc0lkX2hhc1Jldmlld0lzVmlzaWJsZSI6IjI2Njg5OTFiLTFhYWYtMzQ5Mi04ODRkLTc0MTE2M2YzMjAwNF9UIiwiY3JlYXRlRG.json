Genuinely moving, funny, inventive and even throughout. The time flew by and even as I kept feeling like the music was not as strong as in the first, I still left the theater wanting to buy the soundtrack, exactly like I did for the first. It's a supremely confident, and wonderful.\n\nExcept for the Weezer cover over the credits.","displayName":"Benn P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T20:57:26.404Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T20:57:27.742Z","user":{"userId":"830442131","realm":"RT","displayName":"Benn P","accountLink":"/user/id/830442131"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!!

With that said, it did it's job and entertained me. Story wise, it's a convoluted mess.  Plus I hated Olaf in this.  Also the songs feel like forced and are only there to pad the movie out, since there wasn't much to the story.","displayName":"Chris H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1006090088/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T20:55:16.686Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T20:55:29.013Z","user":{"userId":"811789658","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris H","accountLink":"/user/id/811789658"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"‚ùÑBest movie ever‚ùÑ I laugh and cry...It was fascinatingüòÅüíô","displayName":"Scarlette","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T20:54:29.342Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T20:54:29.342Z","user":{"userId":"BD462CF4-03B8-4501-B937-ACBAF8468EC0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Scarlette","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Love between sisters is the best","displayName":"Milvia","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T20:52:42.256Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T20:52:42.256Z","user":{"userId":"6320184d-fb62-4d69-8fbc-e9727e222b0b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Milvia","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"New songs were amazing and the story behing was completly wonderful","displayName":"Rosa Castro","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T20:48:21.284Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T20:48:21.284Z","user":{"userId":"477C79C5-09AF-454F-A1CE-FE1F43F3D257","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rosa Castro","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"10/10 would see again","displayName":"Clara P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T20:46:27.707Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T02:02:49.658Z","user":{"userId":"00453A29-723D-402D-A69A-4613FD04AF40","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Clara P","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"}]}
