And the love between all of the characters showed how much they were willing to let each other grow, even if it meant letting go of each other and facing the fear of being without them.  The beautiful part is them finding their way back to each other. Each character was then able to share what they learned from being apart and from what I assume, loving each other even more.","displayName":"Liza D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T16:19:25.679Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T16:19:25.679Z","user":{"userId":"3dff4117-fdd7-499d-8c75-7b69b2febb53","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Liza D","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Definitely better than the first one, had a lot more adult themes, darker tones.
