Best visuals I've ever seen on an animated film, enjoyable songs with a couple of showstopping numbers (you'll know it when you see it), surprisingly exciting action scenes, and a well thought out story that perfectly ties in the first movie. I'm a 30 year old guy and I loved it, as did my wife and my daughter and son. It's a rare thing to see an animated movie that keeps your kids quiet because they're so into the story and the characters, while also making two adults cry and laugh while not feeling annoyed a single time throughout the movie. Will absolutely be taking the family to see this multiple times over the holidays (we've already seen it twice and I liked it even more the second time around).","displayName":"Jim K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T01:19:53.849Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T01:19:53.849Z","user":{"userId":"964928065","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jim K","accountLink":"/user/id/964928065"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was amazing!!!
