The comedy in this film is absolutely fantastic, and I cant think of a joke that fell flat the whole time.\n\nHowever, the entire movie wasnt one big comedy, and thats where I begin to notice the issues.  Firstly, the plot development in this movie is very uneven.  The conclusion of the film, where you are supposed to receive all the emotional payoff, lasts about 3-4 minutes.  Mind you, this is the CONCLUSION AND RESOLUTION TO THE ENTIRE PLOT.\n\nSecond, I find a central issue with the fact that it simply lacks a main villain.  Throughout the movie, there is really no one or nothing that you can definitely pin as the antagonist to the film.\n\nThird is the plot itself.  It is honestly so predictable, I might as well have just stayed at home and made the movie on my iPhone, with me playing all the character, and I think it wouldve been a better plot.\n\nFinally, the characters.  There are people that they used very well, such as Olaf, and Kristoff.  However, it is my opinion that there was absolutely no character development for either Anna or Elsa.  The person I went to see it with disagrees with me, but it seems as though the two leads for this film dont change at all, and even regress from the two amazing characters from the first movie we came to love.\n\nOverall, Frozen 2 is a PASSABLE sequel, and I only recommend it if you have young children, as this is much more the target demographic this time.\n\nOh, one thing I forgot to mention. The score was pretty much entirely forgettable.  As I sit here, writing this, I can think of one song, out of the entire film.  It has nothing to compare to the ear worms of do you want to build a snowman or let it go.\n\nWhile I know its hard to capture the lightning in a bottle that was the original Frozen, the sequel is so pale, that it just doesnt compare at all.","displayName":"Matthew","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T14:22:51.056Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T14:22:51.056Z","user":{"userId":"1c08507d-e4d7-4aee-b504-c0eefff8ed21","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Matthew","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie was amazing very appropriate for minor children.
