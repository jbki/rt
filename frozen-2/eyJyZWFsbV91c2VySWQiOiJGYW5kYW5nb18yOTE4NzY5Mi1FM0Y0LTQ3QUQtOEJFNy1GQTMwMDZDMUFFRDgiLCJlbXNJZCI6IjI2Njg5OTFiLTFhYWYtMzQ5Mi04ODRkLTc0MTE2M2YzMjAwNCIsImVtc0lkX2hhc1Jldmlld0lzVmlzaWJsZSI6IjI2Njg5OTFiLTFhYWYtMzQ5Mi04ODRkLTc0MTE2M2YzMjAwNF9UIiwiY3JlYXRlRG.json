The best analogy I could attach to this movie is of an experience I've had in previous instances. A friend wants to get you to do something for them, and in order to convince you, they bring up the past. In this case, Frozen II is your friend, and they're trying to get you to better their corporate overlord's image. There are way to many references to Frozen I in place of actual comedy. They're basically saying \"look at what we did in this last movie. Because we did this, you know this has to be good!\" This movie just feels so empty, and character development is almost completely absent. They're holding onto the past, and it's honestly sad to watch. If you've bought the DVD for this movie, I advise you to throw it into your grandparents fireplace, and breath in the smoke from the burning plastic. You'll get a better high from doing that than from however many times you re-watch this.","displayName":"Iden E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/771180103400280/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T01:51:25.372Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T14:31:03.868Z","user":{"userId":"978488378","realm":"RT","displayName":"Iden E","accountLink":"/user/id/978488378"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Subpar for a sequel.
