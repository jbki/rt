Full of recap given in a touching and funny way. I think there is a lot of reference for the 80's kids out there! I have never laughted soo much (my abs did hurt afterwards along with my sis who was with me). This new chapter is great for kids but in my perspective it is even greater for the adults along ;) The songs are nice but not as great as the first one but.... I like the country feel of some of the songs and the other version of the major songs (in the credits). The visual is stunning and greater than Frozen (I).\nIt didn't try  to forcefully go into society trends and follow its own path. Frozen II, like Frozen, is a movie that demonstrate that dysney can still provide original story that can hold itself!\nNot a dizzling movie, but I think I goes voluntary into a more low key feeling and mature which is refreshing and relaxing (when not laughting like crazy). It leave more rooms for Olaf and Kristoff to express themselves beyond the main characters (Anna and Elsa). That focus on characters inner through is put on a different level here which older audience can relate to.\nIn a nutshell, a great autumn dysney movie, more mature, which leave the watcher with a nice bittersweet feeling (at least it was my case).","displayName":"Maud D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10156414415451096/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T19:28:24.264Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T19:28:33.456Z","user":{"userId":"978428684","realm":"RT","displayName":"Maud D","accountLink":"/user/id/978428684"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Had a hard time getting into the movie (story).

I found the pacing, structure and some convoluted plot points and progressions rather messy, but the mystery elements are great, and the film gives us a lot of needed answers about Elsa's and Arendelle's past. The musical highlights are Lost in the Woods which is a hugely entertaining 80s ballad parody and of course an instantly memorable, beautifully sung and epic Into the Unknown. The humor is also quite strong as Olaf made a couple of hilarious observations. The first act dragged, but the ending is nice, the cave and flashback scenes are the best parts, and Elsa riding a water spirit provided some epic imagery.","displayName":"David L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000787676881/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T17:15:19.051Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T17:15:22.592Z","user":{"userId":"901488735","realm":"RT","displayName":"David L","accountLink":"/user/id/901488735"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was one of the best animated movies I have ever seen.","displayName":"Mike H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-12T16:43:56.828Z","updateDate":"2019-12-12T16:43:56.828Z","user":{"userId":"eb3859a5-a5ce-4fff-831c-af5ae0db8d58","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mike H","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My daughter and I love the movie!!
