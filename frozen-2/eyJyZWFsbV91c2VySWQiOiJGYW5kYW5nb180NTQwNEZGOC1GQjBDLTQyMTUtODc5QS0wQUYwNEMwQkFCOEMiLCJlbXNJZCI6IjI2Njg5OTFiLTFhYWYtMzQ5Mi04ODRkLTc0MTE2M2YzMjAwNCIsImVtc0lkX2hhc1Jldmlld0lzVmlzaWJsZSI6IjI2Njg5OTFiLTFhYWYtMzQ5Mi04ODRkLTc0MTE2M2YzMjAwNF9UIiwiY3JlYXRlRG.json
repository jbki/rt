If you are older, and especially if you are a fan of mythology and fable, you are likely to be disappointed by the very mediocre writing. All of the \"best\" moments are lifted directly from other stories you've seen before, spliced together into a bit of a gooey mess. You also will want to avoid watching the first film before going to see this one, the passage of time my have helped you forget plot points that directly contradict this story's narrative, especially regarding the girls' parents, who may end up appearing somewhat mentally unbalanced given what we learn about their history.","displayName":"Tim E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/625761242/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T07:06:52.957Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T07:07:01.184Z","user":{"userId":"802222530","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tim E","accountLink":"/user/id/802222530"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!!!
