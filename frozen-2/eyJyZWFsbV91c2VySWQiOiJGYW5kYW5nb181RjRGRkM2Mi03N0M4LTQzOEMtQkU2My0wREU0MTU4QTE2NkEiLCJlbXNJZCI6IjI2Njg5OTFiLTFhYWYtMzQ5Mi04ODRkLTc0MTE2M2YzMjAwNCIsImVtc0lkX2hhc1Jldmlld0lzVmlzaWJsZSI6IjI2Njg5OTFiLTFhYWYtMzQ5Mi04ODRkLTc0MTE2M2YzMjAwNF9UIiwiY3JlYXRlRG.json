I cannot believe I'm saying this, but I am... I loved Frozen 2 even more than Frozen. The movie is sheer magic. It has a huge heart and is hilarious in spots. Also, the best 3D film I've ever seen.\n\nEver heard of Stendhal Syndrome? I was crying in the theater just overcome with emotion at how incredible the film was. Humans came together, worked together, to create this incredible piece of art. Yes. Art.\n\nGo see it.  Also, stay through the credits... you don't want to miss Olaf's parting words.","displayName":"Furrawn  S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T06:54:52.342Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T06:54:52.342Z","user":{"userId":"978400162","realm":"RT","displayName":"Furrawn  S","accountLink":"/user/id/978400162"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Frozen 2 continues on the success of the original Frozen, with Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell reprising their roles as sisters Anna and Elsa. This time, they are again joined by Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven (Josh Gad and Jonathan Groff) on an adventure beyond their homeland of Arendelle in order to discover the origin of Elsa's magical powers and save their kingdom. While there isn't much new here, we do see Yelana (Martha Plimpton), the leader of the Northuldra tribe joined by tribe members Ryder (Jason Ritter), and Honeymaren (Rachel Matthews) who are brother and sister, both wants to bring peace to the enchanted forest and share Kristoff's love for reindeer. The Songs of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez are more than adequate, but there isn't quite a \"Let It Snow\" ear worm among the soundtrack and the score by Christophe Beck continues to add the the experience.","displayName":"Vitali G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/26703111/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T06:51:34.801Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T06:51:37.594Z","user":{"userId":"782816517","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vitali G","accountLink":"/user/id/782816517"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Better than the first one!","displayName":"Cailey B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T06:50:54.401Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T06:50:54.401Z","user":{"userId":"B7A2E180-48EF-487F-B280-B0611B04C69C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Cailey B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"‪Oh man... the disappointment that is Frozen 2.
