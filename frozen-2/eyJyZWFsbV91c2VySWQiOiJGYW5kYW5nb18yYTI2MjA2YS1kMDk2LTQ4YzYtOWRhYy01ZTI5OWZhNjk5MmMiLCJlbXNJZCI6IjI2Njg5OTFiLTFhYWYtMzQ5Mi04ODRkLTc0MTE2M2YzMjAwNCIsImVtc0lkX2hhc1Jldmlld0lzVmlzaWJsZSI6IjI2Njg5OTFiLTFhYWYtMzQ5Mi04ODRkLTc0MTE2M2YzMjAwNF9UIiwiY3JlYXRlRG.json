Going into this movie I wasn’t expecting anything really but man this movie sucked. I was bored mostly the entire movie. This movie only had 2 somewhat decent songs, the kristof solo song and Olaf’s solo song. But man did this movie ruin Elsa and Anna for me. They’re more annoying than the last movie. I really enjoyed the last movie unlike many people but man why did this movie get a sequel besides money. This is a very forgettable movie and I hope Disney doesn’t make a third movie but they will.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T06:11:25.930Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T06:11:25.930Z","user":{"userId":"965081444","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/965081444"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved it and thought it was better than the 1st one.","displayName":"kara","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T06:09:55.322Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T06:09:56.740Z","user":{"userId":"d2246bb4-7087-4825-b022-3c66e30a8883","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"kara","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Freaking loved it!

They did it by turning Anna into an obnoxious worrywart and Kristoff a one-dimensional man obsessed with marriage and removing most of Sven's comedy and not using the shopkeeper guy, leaving only Olaf-flavored jokes to bring levity to a dark-toned movie. The songs were too frequent for songs that near-unanimously did not drive or advance the narrative of the movie, and Kristoff's solo was downright cringey. My wife noted that none of the songs seemed to directly reference any of the movie's characters, which seemed like a way to make them coverable by other artists and playable on the radio as none of them were given any details of the movie. Lastly, the characters' eyebrows were physically too long and made them look like they were barely avoiding a unibrow.","displayName":"Jordan M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T06:04:47.536Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T06:04:54.617Z","user":{"userId":"906563787","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jordan M","accountLink":"/user/id/906563787"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved every part of it.
