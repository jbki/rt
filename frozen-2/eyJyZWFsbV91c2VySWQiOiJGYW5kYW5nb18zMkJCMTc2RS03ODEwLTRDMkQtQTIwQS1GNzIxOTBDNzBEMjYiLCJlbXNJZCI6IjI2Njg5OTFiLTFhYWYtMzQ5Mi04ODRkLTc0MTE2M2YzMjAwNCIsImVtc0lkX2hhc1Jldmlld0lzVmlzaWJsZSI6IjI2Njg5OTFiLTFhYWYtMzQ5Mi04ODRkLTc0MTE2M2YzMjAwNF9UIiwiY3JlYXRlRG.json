It isn't blatantly man-bashing, and includes archetypal elements (the call to adventure, refusal of the call, crossing the threshold, road of trials) in a (wo)man-versus-nature narrative. The songs weren't as catchy as the first, and the dialogue is stilted most of the time. Still, you feel like you sat through an actual movie this time, and if your kids liked the first one, they will like this one too.","displayName":"Dustin D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/16817936/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T23:34:31.513Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T23:34:41.172Z","user":{"userId":"906114068","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dustin D","accountLink":"/user/id/906114068"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️","displayName":"Sherian M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T23:28:43.707Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T23:28:43.707Z","user":{"userId":"46E1207E-8502-474D-A41D-8EA73D93B59B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sherian M","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"}]}
