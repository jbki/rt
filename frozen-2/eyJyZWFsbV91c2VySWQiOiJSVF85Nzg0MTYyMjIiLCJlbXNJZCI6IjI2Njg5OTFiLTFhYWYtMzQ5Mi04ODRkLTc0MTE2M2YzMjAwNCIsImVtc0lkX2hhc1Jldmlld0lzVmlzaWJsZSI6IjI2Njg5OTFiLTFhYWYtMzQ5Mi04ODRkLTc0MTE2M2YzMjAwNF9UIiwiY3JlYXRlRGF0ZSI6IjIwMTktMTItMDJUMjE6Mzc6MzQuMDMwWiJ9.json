The movie has so much depth and the songs/lyrics of the movie are incredible. I urge anyone who watched the movie to watch it a second time. Once you understand where the story is going, your second viewing becomes so much more immersive as you focus on the characters and the meaning behind each song.","displayName":"Perfect and Beautiful","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T20:53:01.424Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T20:53:01.424Z","user":{"userId":"E88D7EDA-06A8-4899-BC6F-2E3D19C14B68","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Perfect and Beautiful","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My 5 year old grandson and I loved the movie!","displayName":"Nancibeth","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T20:35:09.770Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T20:35:09.770Z","user":{"userId":"aa3464be-9adb-454c-9a61-e045e18e1623","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Nancibeth","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie was so nice and so touch. \nMy 5 years old and 3 years are love it.! \nElsa and Anna so pretty.","displayName":"ying","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T20:32:58.682Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T20:32:58.682Z","user":{"userId":"5917312f-1c6a-492d-a793-3b47bc85d422","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"ying","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Watching a Disney movie in theatre is fun in and off its own. The laughter by all the kids above and below does lighten up the atmosphere.\n\nThe story is not bad. It is a continuation only in ways of the character, with an entirely new chapter. It is not the most moving story, but I would have give the writer some credit. There isn't much to go by to begin with. \n\nI enjoyed the movie not by far.","displayName":"Shirley W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T20:12:32.867Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T20:12:34.910Z","user":{"userId":"978226508","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shirley W","accountLink":"/user/id/978226508"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"}]}
