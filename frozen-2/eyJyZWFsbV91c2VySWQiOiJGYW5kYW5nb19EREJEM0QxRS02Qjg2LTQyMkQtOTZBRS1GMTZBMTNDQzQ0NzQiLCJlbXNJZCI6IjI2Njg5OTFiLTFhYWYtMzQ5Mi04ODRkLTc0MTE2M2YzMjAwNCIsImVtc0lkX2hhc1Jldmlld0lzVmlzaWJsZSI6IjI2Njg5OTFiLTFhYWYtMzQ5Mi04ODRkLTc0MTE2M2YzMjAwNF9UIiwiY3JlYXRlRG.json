The story is - ok, it has a satisfactory ending. The millions of children in the theater loved it, especially the Olaf moments. There is a scene towards the end that could upset children, so assure them Olaf will come out ok. The music is wonderful. Suggest your family listen to the  the songs before you go, I found it added to the experience.","displayName":"V V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T18:59:43.305Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T18:59:43.305Z","user":{"userId":"d9ec8766-c3db-43ba-95a6-91f3ea1ff099","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"V V","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved it!
