I enjoyed the first film but didn't think it justified a sequel. While this film didn't hold to its predecessor, it did surprise me quite a bit. \nSet three years after the events of the first film, the story follows Elsa (Idina Menzel), Anna (Kristen Bell), Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), Olaf (Josh Gad), and Sven, who embark on a journey beyond their kingdom of Arendelle in order to discover the origin of Elsa's magical powers and save their kingdom after a mysterious voice calls out to Elsa.\nAgain, the voice acting is great. Everybody returns full force as if they have never left. Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel shine as the loveable sisters Anna and Elsa. Josh Gad is just as funny as he was in the first one, though may be over the top at some parts, no fault of his own. Kristoff gets pushed into the background in this one, and Johnathan Groff doesn't get a chance to shine as much as the other cast.\nThe animation is gorgeous. It's right up there with the first one, but it has a bigger color scheme. Where the movie fell a little short for me is it's pacing. The movie was slow going in the first and second act, picking it up for the third, which was great. Sure, there were still plenty of humorous moments, but I personally felt myself longing for more. Also, the songs in this movie didn't hit as mich as they did in the first one, especially when they try to give Kristoff a solo song that feels like an 80's pop song, it was out of place.\nOverall, I'm gad I watched this movie, it expands a bit more on the lore we know and love from the first one, but I don't have a desire to watch it again. The third act was amazing both visually and emotionally, but it lacked in the first two acts.\n3.5/5","displayName":"Patrick R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001678884576/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-04T01:45:43.551Z","updateDate":"2020-01-04T01:45:44.946Z","user":{"userId":"929591500","realm":"RT","displayName":"Patrick R","accountLink":"/user/id/929591500"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"5h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Even better than the first!!","displayName":"Stephanie H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-04T01:38:27.025Z","updateDate":"2020-01-04T01:38:27.025Z","user":{"userId":"35990B0C-8DED-433A-AB80-6FE62A522A80","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Stephanie H","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"5h ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It was fantastic my girls loved the movie so much.
