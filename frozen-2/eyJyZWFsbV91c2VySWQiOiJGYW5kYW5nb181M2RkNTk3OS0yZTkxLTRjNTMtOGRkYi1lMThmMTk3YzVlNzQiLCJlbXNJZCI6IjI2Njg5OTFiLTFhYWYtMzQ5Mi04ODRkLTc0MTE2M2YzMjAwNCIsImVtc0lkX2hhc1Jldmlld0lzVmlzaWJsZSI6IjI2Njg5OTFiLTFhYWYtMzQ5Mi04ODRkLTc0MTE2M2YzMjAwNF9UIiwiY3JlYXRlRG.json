This movie did not disappoint - it was whimsical, family oriented, and had great special effects. It went deeper into the characters to \"humanize\" them more, and we experienced many emotions during the movie. The ice horse was amazing!  As soon as the movie ended my granddaughter said \"I can't wait to see it again\" - and I have to agree with that","displayName":"FL Gal","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T18:00:20.484Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T18:00:20.484Z","user":{"userId":"fb23b94f-7d8f-47fa-b102-728345d6bc18","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"FL Gal","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fun movie, music may not be quite what the original was but the solid story makes up for that.","displayName":"Kyle","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T17:59:20.271Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T17:59:20.271Z","user":{"userId":"677f2b26-f2b8-4e1e-a151-147730d42419","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kyle","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Songs not at catchy as original.
