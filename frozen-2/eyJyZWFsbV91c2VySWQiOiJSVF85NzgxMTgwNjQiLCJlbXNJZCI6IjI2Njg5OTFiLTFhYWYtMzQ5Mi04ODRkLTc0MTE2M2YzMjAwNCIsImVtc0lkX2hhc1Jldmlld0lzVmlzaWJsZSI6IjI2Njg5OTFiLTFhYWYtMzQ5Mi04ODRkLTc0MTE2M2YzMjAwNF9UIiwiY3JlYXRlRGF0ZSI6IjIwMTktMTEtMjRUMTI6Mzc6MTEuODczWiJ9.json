The vocal cast is excellent, as usual, with the originals mostly dominating still (the cast members Sterling K. Brown and Evan Rachel Wood have small roles at best).  The highlight this time is Jonathan Groff's Kristoff, who finally gets his own song.  Behind the camera, director Chris Buck and writer Jennifer Lee move the story forward, expanding not he mythology of Elsa's powers and Arendelle.  One nice touch is that it partially redeems some characters from the first film and the animation is absolutely gorgeous (the depiction of the forest spirits is majestic).  The one slight is no song really stands out like \"Let It Go\", though they are all nicely done.  Overall, Disney looks to have a another billion dollar franchise on their hands, as if they didn't need another one.","displayName":"Johnathon W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/664155011/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T12:31:39.172Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T12:31:42.904Z","user":{"userId":"857932456","realm":"RT","displayName":"Johnathon W","accountLink":"/user/id/857932456"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Too many songs.
