You find out more information from the first movie. There was a few too many songs. I feel like Disney will make a musical or broadway play.

The plot is thin, the supporting characters undeveloped, and the music — though well performed — seems more like a cash grab than an integral part of the movie. Rather than support the movie, it actually detracts from it. (This also goes for Kristoff's side plot, though that does give us a humorous song.)\n\nIn short, the kids loved it. I, however, was merely waiting for it to end.","displayName":"Jeff D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T12:45:22.590Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T12:45:25.374Z","user":{"userId":"977143223","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeff D","accountLink":"/user/id/977143223"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The score & storyline was awesome as was the songs.
