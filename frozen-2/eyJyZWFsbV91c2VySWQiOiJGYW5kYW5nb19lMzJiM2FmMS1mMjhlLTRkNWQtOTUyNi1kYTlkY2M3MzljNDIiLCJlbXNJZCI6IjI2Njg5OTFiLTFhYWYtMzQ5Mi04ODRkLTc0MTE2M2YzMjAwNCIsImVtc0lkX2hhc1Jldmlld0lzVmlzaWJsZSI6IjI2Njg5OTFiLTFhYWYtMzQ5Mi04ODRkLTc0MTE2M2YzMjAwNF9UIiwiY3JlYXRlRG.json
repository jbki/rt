The animation is fantastic as expected, and the characters have complex stories that connect well with the audience. The story itself is intriguing, and manages to hold the attention of an older audience. Characters feel consistent with the original, and ultimately send a positive message about accepting yourself and others. The movie does back down from making too strong a political message which is understandable though feels a little disappointing at moments. Another disappointment is the music, if that was your favorite part of the original you will not be satisfied with this movie. The songs are fun and entertaining enough, but none stick in your head anything like the music from the original. The story, characters, and animation was by far enough to compensate for this if you don't really mind the songs. Overall a great experience.","displayName":"Sophie T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-11T20:44:41.943Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T20:44:41.943Z","user":{"userId":"978427650","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sophie T","accountLink":"/user/id/978427650"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Well done...great story  overall not as good as the original!","displayName":"Melissa  d","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-11T20:23:15.099Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T20:23:15.099Z","user":{"userId":"3047B795-378A-4E9F-B085-623A03E843FB","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Melissa  d","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Muy bonita pelicula, ya se sabia que iba a ser una pelicula asegurada","displayName":"Oscar M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1813457025427429/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-11T19:56:47.205Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T19:56:54.747Z","user":{"userId":"977843022","realm":"RT","displayName":"Oscar M","accountLink":"/user/id/977843022"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it more than the first Frozen.
