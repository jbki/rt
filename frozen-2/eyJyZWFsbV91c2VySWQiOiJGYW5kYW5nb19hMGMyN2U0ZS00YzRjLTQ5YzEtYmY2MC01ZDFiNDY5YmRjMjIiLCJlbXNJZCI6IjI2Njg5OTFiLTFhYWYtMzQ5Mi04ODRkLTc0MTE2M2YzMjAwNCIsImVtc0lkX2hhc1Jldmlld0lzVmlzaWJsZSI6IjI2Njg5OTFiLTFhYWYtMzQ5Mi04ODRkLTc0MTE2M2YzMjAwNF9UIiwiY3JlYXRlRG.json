Personally, although I do think the music has been more than overplayed, I think the first film still stands on its own as a great animated feature film. Disney surprised me with that film in 2013 and even though I wasn't asking for a continuation, I was still very happy to watch it. Thankfully, even though it's obvious this movie got made to make the studio tons of cash, it also has some thought put into it, building off its predecessor the way a sequel should. \n\nWith a call coming from an enchanted forest that Anna and Elsa were warned to never enter as kids, the two of them, along with the return of Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf, all bravely venture inside. Discovering that she may be able to find the origin of her powers, Elsa splits from the rest of the crew. This movie separates these characters for the majority of the run time, which I feel may have slightly hurt the movie. There is some nice closure that gives reason for why everyone needed to be separated, but it would've been nice to see them all have a little more screen time together. \n\nAside from the song Let it Go, which will never be topped in terms of catchiness, I found that the soundtrack to Frozen II was far superior. The first film utilized the songs to tell the story most of the time, but also favoured them over the story at times. This film prioritizes them and works every song into the narrative in the way that I feel a proper musical should. Frozen II may not be an overall better movie than the first, but the musical aspect is very much an improvement. \n\nAs always, the visuals are breathtaking and almost look realistic at times, the voice work is very impressive, and the messages throughout the movie are all great for kids, which is who this film is made for first and foremost. One of my complaints however, even though I still enjoyed his presence, was Olaf. Much like the use of Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2, he is overused for comedic relief, far more than he was in the first film. I really enjoy his presence as I said, so it didn't ruin the film at all, it just felt like a bit much at times. \n\nIn the end, with great music, a very solid story, visuals that would impress any viewer, and a worthy successor to that of the first film, Frozen II is worth your time. If you were a fan of the first film in any way, I think this movie will satisfy you if you have been eager to see this story continue. With that said, this really isn't a linear progression of the last film, but rather an evolution of it, which I appreciated. This is a solid sequel and I would gladly revisit it eventually, but I really don't see the need for another one. We'll see how much money this one makes I guess. Frozen II gets the seal of approval from me.","displayName":"KJ P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/733768972/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T21:05:42.180Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T21:05:44.579Z","user":{"userId":"896976177","realm":"RT","displayName":"KJ P","accountLink":"/user/id/896976177"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very good think first one has better songs","displayName":"Ann S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T21:04:45.249Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T21:04:45.249Z","user":{"userId":"D046369B-D516-45C9-8224-0F34E70DCDB4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ann S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I liked Olaf more than anything.
