And no fun songs!  Frozen 2 story felt very bland and had a few moments that stood out but if Bruni was not in this movie, I would have given it a 2/5.  Nothing exciting to really see and I could have waited for this to come out on blue-ray/streaming services.","displayName":"Mark R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000459024281/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T14:33:43.903Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T14:33:57.444Z","user":{"userId":"962443447","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark R","accountLink":"/user/id/962443447"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Disliked loud people behind us.

In fact, it even mocked its predecessor's favorite song.  Obviously the characters are all familiar, but they did not skip on further developing the characters.  My kids loved it, the adults and semi adults in our family also loved it.  I'm glad we have Disney+ so we can see it when it becomes available on demand.","displayName":"Daniel J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T13:05:40.311Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T13:05:40.311Z","user":{"userId":"c36dc416-e5f9-4bab-9db5-6e95e194e426","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Daniel J","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Frozen 2 was a lot of fun.
