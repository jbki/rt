It definitely differed from Frozen in many ways. The songs were more like big broadway showtunes and sometimes felt out of place. There was a little something odd about the animation of the faces, specifically the mouths. The movie was fun to watch and also very funny, with dialog similar to a Shrek movie. Overall, I think itâ€™s a good movie.","displayName":"Jerry C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T23:03:54.846Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T23:03:54.846Z","user":{"userId":"7E7BB733-DCFC-4D28-8A6A-85F3AA21A69E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jerry C","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Not as good as the first (mostly because the songs aren't as good) - but still is fun and has good moments.

The music is not as catchy as in Frozen, but that may be a good thing because it won't earworm its way into your life and never leave. There are plenty of references for adults and Olaf is fantastic in this follow up to the original smash hit. It's worth a look so go check it out!","displayName":"Jennifer J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T22:49:21.712Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T22:49:21.712Z","user":{"userId":"7dd87dcf-1d75-4697-9bc3-aaf5d03bf698","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jennifer J","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"loved it ....better then the first one","displayName":"Amy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T22:48:09.343Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T22:48:09.343Z","user":{"userId":"E7728A90-A02E-41C1-9F56-FE7C9AD4F7E5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Amy","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A good story and worth of being a sequel","displayName":"Maribel","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T22:47:36.439Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T22:47:36.439Z","user":{"userId":"0D86D7C2-A4C3-4707-9A21-D95A698C7F64","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Maribel","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"}]}
