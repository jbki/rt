I felt that the plot was poorly developed with some holes and also failed to convinced me that this movie really served some purpose. I feel that throughout the movie there was great choppiness and moments that made it hard to follow. For instance, within the first couple of minutes of the movie starting, Anna breaks into song about some random topic that I felt didn't really fit in with the introduction or when two groups of characters that were in a dispute suddenly just got along well and didn't really explain the reasoning behind it. There were also other moments that just seemed out of place (I don't want to give spoilers). Furthermore, the writers failed to explore and develop the new world and characters that they had introduced as they throw it at us and expect us to care and develop a connection. I feel that this story had a lot of potential, they just failed to develop it. I would still say that kids are going to enjoy it and the songs are still decent although not as good as the prior. The songs felt a bit weird to me, they just didn't have the typical Disney charm for some reason. I would still say that Frozen 2 is worth a watch, just don't go in with high expectations.","displayName":"Kyla F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T09:12:16.809Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T09:13:49.554Z","user":{"userId":"978406598","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kyla F","accountLink":"/user/id/978406598"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Rating: B+\n\n\"All in all, Frozen II compensates the six-year wait with a follow-up worthy of standing up to its original, which in my opinion, surpasses it. With an emotionally complex narrative, Elsa's powers are explored and developed in a captivating, creative, fun, and entertaining way. Disney really put their best animators on this because the quality of animation has never been as visually impressive as this. It really feels like a magical film. Elsa's magic demonstration plus the powerful, chill-inducing original score are two aspects that together provide some truly epic moments. However, Olaf is the MVP with a lot more screentime than in the original, and with a couple of the most hilarious scenes of the year. It's a shame that the focus on Elsa's arc pushed every other character aside, making them feel useless and with no exciting or impactful subplot. Runtime feels a bit stretched due to their side adventures, and exposition is pretty heavy throughout the entire duration. In the end, it's still a contender for Best Animated Feature Film of 2019.\"","displayName":"MSBReviews .","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T09:10:04.070Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T09:10:06.540Z","user":{"userId":"976002553","realm":"RT","displayName":"MSBReviews .","accountLink":"/user/id/976002553"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Even more entertaining than anticipated!!!!

The animation and visuals were phenomenal and just gorgeous especially Nokk the Water Spirit, Bruni the Fire Spirit Salamander, Olaf, Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, Mattias, Iduna, Sven, and the Earth Giants. The songwriting, music, and every song was exceptional. The soundtrack is my favorite soundtrack of 2019, one of my top 5 favorite albums of 2019, my 2nd favorite animated movie soundtrack, my 3rd favorite Disney movie soundtrack, and one of my top 5 favorite soundtracks of all time. The voice acting was remarkable especially from Idina Menzel, Josh Gad, Jonathan Groff, Kristen Bell, Evan Rachel Wood, Martha Plimpton, Jason Ritter, Sterling K. Brown, Alfred Molina, and Paul Briggs. The writing and storytelling was outstanding, I loved the darker and more mature tone and story. This movie was everything I hoped and so much more, a definite A+ movie.","displayName":"Noah M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T08:41:28.382Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T22:41:35.195Z","user":{"userId":"976779657","realm":"RT","displayName":"Noah M","accountLink":"/user/id/976779657"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A heartfelt tale of family, friendship and true self-discovery, Frozen II delves deep into our beloved characters world that is Frozen and beyond!
