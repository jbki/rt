Frozen 1 glossed over almost all the world-building in sacrifice to a more powerful narrative regarding 2 alienated sisters. This movie does an amazing job building on top of the first film in terms of the lore, as well as continuing all 4 main characters arcs into their next natural progression. Unlike the first movie it is much more complex and deep, regarding the themes and lore, and offers much bigger humour and life lessons to a larger scope of audiences.\n\nThe movie addresses many difficult social and cultural issues, like tackling the fear of change, finding where you belong, dealing with historic injustices (reparations), dealing with grief, and more. Most of these are surprisingly fresh things to see from a Disney animated film, especially a sequel. And it doesn't sacrifice much as the songs all play into these themes, while driving the plot forward. \n\nMy only gripe with the film is that it doesn't give itself enough time to breath near the end, and it's left many people missing the implications of lines of dialog, character motivations, and the emotional impact of certain scenes. All I can say is that the answers are all in the film, if you're attentive, and that this movie will stay fresh over multiple viewing much more than the first.\n\nIf you're looking for a highly re-watchable, thought provoking film with great themes, depth, humour, and songs, then Frozen 2 might be your next favourite film.","displayName":"Matthew C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/631980970/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T03:59:13.640Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T03:59:21.658Z","user":{"userId":"801499768","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew C","accountLink":"/user/id/801499768"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Such a great movie!!
