Incredibly funny, even when it seemed like the story was going to a dark place. In fact, much funnier than the first one. While it lacks the super catchy songs the first one gave us, Idina Menzel's \"Into The Unknown\" will send shivers down your spine. Action and drama, accompanied by the beautiful story of true love between siblings still keeps the movie at least 1 level above other Disney originals. While it may not be as unpredictable as the first one, Frozen 2 still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat. Disney managed to pack it with stuff that both young and old can find exciting (Olaf's ans Kristoff's songs for example). While it takes a while to consume Frozen 2's impact, it is without a doubt an exciting journey that lived up to our very high expectations. Safe to say, I am ready for Frozen 3 to come out.","displayName":"Gabriela R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2839311642766316/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T21:57:41.314Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T03:58:48.803Z","user":{"userId":"978401125","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gabriela R","accountLink":"/user/id/978401125"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I liked a lot of it.  I will say that a couple songs came in at awkward times and it seemed like there were too many songs.  Perhaps the first movie had better songs, but I liked this plot better than the first movie.
