The joy of discovering new characters and exciting sequences is always exciting. This sequel, while maintaining some of the beautiful visuals, falls short. The sisters (and the rest of their gang) embark on an adventure to save their kingdom. This time, there's more dialogue and drama, which means the pace isn't as brisk. The characters all have their moments and the songs are plentiful, but the comedy is scarce and the songs are striving too hard to be memorable. It's always nice to see a story wrapped up so sweetly, but I just wish the movie experience had its own happy ending.  NOTE: Stay thru the credits for Olaf's summary.","displayName":"Jerry W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T14:42:14.273Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T14:42:16.722Z","user":{"userId":"978205059","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jerry W","accountLink":"/user/id/978205059"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Film animation and storyline was amazing","displayName":"safiro","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T14:30:58.676Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T14:30:58.676Z","user":{"userId":"23d0ef71-6b0e-41a7-a566-427f56960b0d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"safiro","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing movie.
