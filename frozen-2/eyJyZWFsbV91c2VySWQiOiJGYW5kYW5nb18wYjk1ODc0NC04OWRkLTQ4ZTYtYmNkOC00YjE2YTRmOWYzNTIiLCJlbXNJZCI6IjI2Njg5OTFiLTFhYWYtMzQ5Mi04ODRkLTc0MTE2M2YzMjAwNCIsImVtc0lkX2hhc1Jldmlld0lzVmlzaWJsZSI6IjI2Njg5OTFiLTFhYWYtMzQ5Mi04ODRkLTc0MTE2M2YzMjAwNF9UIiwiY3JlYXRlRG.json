I wasn't impressed with the rest of the soundtrack. I thought the plot was a bit boring, and maybe a little confusing for kids (not a kid though, so I'm speculating). The character arcs made sense, but they were lost in the story, which moved too slowly for my tastes. It seemed like a much longer film than it actually was. Costume designs were nice enough, though I preferred those in the first film.","displayName":"Tobz","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-17T02:08:01.228Z","updateDate":"2019-12-17T02:08:01.228Z","user":{"userId":"4a276da3-da50-408a-a42a-999d1518e91c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tobz","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2019"}]}
