Outstanding philosophizing from the Snowman, including pondering on the transience of life, and the sappy--but resonant--conclusion that all that can remain is love. Loved the songs and the visuals. Disney magic at its best.","displayName":"Stelios T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T08:00:30.500Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T08:00:50.368Z","user":{"userId":"891922544","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stelios T","accountLink":"/user/id/891922544"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very great sequel.

The animations were amazing and the effects were stunning. The plot was good except for some turns that were confusing. Most of the movies plot-pushing events were through singing, which is ok for a little while, but then starts to get to be annoying, which is my only problem with the movie. Very well done and would recommend!","displayName":"Connor S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T06:13:01.658Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T06:13:17.377Z","user":{"userId":"978468725","realm":"RT","displayName":"Connor S","accountLink":"/user/id/978468725"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was beautiful.
