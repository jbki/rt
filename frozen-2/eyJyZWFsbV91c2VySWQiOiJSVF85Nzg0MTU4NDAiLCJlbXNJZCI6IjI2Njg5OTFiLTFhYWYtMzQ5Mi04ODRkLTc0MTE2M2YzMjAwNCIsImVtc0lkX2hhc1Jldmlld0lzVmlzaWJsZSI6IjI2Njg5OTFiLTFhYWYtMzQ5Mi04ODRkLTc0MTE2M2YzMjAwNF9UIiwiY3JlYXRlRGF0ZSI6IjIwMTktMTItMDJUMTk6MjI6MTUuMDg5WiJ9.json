Frozen II was a great improvement over the first Frozen movie, which was just \"ok\", in my opinion, although a bit formulaic like most movies these days. The songs are great and the visuals are simply beautiful. Good movie for the young ones, and the young at heart like me.","displayName":"Elizabeth","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T19:18:16.541Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T19:18:16.541Z","user":{"userId":"7be3c6e9-3025-4053-a1a9-977d2cd2161c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Elizabeth","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fun movie for the whole family!

Children will have the same sort of excitement and laughter that came with Frozen the first time around, and adults will appreciate the beautiful animation and score. Frozen 2's shortcomings arrive when you look past the surface. For instance, Christoph's conflict does not resolve satisfactorily with the sister's story. As a result, Frozen 2 does not feel like it would have lost anything but a wonderfully awkward song by not including him. Bottom line is that Frozen 2 is an enjoyable movie that you should certainly see if you are looking for a movie to see this holiday season.","displayName":"Ethan C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-02T19:12:33.875Z","updateDate":"2019-12-02T19:12:33.875Z","user":{"userId":"978416062","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ethan C","accountLink":"/user/id/978416062"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was better than the last one.
