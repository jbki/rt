The story is both simple and convoluted all at once, but manages to provide twists and turns that make the entire ride engaging, it's also the characters interactions that make up for the misses in the film. The music, while not as catchy as the first film, is still remarkable as it heads in a more emotionally driven score compared to the upbeat sense of the first film. Visually this movie is beautiful, Disney has pushed cgi animation to the next level with astonishing scenes full of color and contrasting elements. Overall this movie is a worthy sequel to Frozen, that exceeds all my hopes and dreams.","displayName":"Garrett R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T00:47:02.469Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T00:47:10.852Z","user":{"userId":"978208980","realm":"RT","displayName":"Garrett R","accountLink":"/user/id/978208980"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"}]}
