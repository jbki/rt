Beautiful design,  stunning music (every song is catchy, there is even an 80's rock balladfor the grownups), insane detail. They worked extremely hard on this movie and it shows.  It is polished.  Wonderful twist on Scandinavian fairy tale mythology. emotional situations were very relatable,  and has a very strong message.  Kristoff sums it up when he says \"my love is not Fragile \" . They go through some hard stuff especially for a kids movie. It true Disney fashion, Its heart breaking then heart warming.  I will be purchasing this when its available.","displayName":"Megan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-22T14:07:35.069Z","updateDate":"2019-12-22T14:07:35.069Z","user":{"userId":"83c4e085-5dae-4fbb-9297-1efb02b2cd07","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Megan","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Definitely worth seeing.
