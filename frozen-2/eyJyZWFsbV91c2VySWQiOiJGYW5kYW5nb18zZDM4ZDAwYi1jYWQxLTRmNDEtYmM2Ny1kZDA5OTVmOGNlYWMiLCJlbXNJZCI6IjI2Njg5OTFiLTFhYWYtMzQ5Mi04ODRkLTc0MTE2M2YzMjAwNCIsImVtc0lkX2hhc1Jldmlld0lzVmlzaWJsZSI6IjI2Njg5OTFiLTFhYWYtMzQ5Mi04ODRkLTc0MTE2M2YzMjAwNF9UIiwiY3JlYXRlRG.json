I took children from age 8-15 and they loved it. The songs were great and the storyline made sense. The young women were empowered to make their own decisions and reap their own rewards and consequences. Yet the movie showed how the people were connected and how what each person in a community does, especially leaders, impacts others -for better or worse. It also showed that forgiveness and redemption is available when people are determined to make things right","displayName":"Datina H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T00:16:40.883Z","updateDate":"2019-12-10T19:01:53.563Z","user":{"userId":"d0db43fc-fe56-4246-b2ed-442eef2e6ccb","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Datina H","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great music, more magic in this storyline compared to the first one.
