I loved how they explained what wasnt explained in the first movie and more detail about the parents and the origin of Elsas power. Just an all around fun, and entertaining sequel to a great film, that isnt just a sequel, but a great stand alone film in its own right.","displayName":"Britiny","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T06:08:24.464Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T06:08:24.464Z","user":{"userId":"7ab6c330-5489-4cb9-9f4a-84655295d6d8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Britiny","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Loved the movie.

The story was decent but Disney lost a bit of what made the original so special.
