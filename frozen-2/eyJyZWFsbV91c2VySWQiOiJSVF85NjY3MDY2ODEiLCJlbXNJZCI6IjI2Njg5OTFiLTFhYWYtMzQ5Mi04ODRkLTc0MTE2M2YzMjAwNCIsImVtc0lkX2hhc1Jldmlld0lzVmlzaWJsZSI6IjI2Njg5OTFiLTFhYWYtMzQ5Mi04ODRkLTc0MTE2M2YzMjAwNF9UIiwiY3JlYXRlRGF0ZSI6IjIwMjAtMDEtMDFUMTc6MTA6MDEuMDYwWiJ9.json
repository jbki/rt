I also like how they did their homework and worked with the indigenous people to tell an accurate tale. I also like how the story shows that we can be our own worst enemy and be the cause of our own hardship until we acknowledge our faults and their effects on the past, present and future, and take action to correct them.","displayName":"Patrick S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T16:25:17.392Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T16:25:17.392Z","user":{"userId":"21CBD9DF-6C30-4290-AF2D-21EA62157005","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Patrick S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie kept going never boring.

The connection with nature, the elements, old religion and the population living in the northern part of Norway. The theme of how you treat other, different, people is strong and how that is connected to the place where one live and how one takes care of it is having a nice connection with a great moral. \nAnna and Elsa are strong girls, using their wits and showing that with their great integrity they can overcome almost anything. It is a very positive message that is spread allover the movie. \nI enjoyed also how the connection with the first movie was make and the hilarious moments that were highlighted by Olof, even more shiny in this movie than the first one.\nI thought some \"singing moments\" are forced and make it a bit ridiculous the situation and Elsa's final steps is just a little bit too weird. I would have also appreciated that the geography (although, sure, this is not a documentary and Arendal is after all in theory fictional) would be a bit more respected when coming to fjords, seas and so on.\nAltogether a good, magical movie, with complex messages delivered in a very smart way, which I hope will not only drown in the merchandise.","displayName":"Arianna B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/573236173/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T14:32:09.177Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T14:32:15.219Z","user":{"userId":"790202006","realm":"RT","displayName":"Arianna B","accountLink":"/user/id/790202006"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I saw it with my daughter who laughed when I said I wanted to see it.
