Then Stop making bad movies!\n\nNothing could be closer to that truth then Frozen 2. Whilst the animator s can hold their heads high in accomplishing their role with some dignity, everything else was cheap and tacky.  \n\nOne of the worst musical scores of this generation had me checking the time periodically and only a handful of well placed jokes kept me from ignoring the overly predictable story line. \n\nEven for a family movie, it's dull character growth and self plagiarism of the original movie is more than I can tolerate from a high budget film.","displayName":"Tj F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10207350541538456/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T03:45:42.732Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T03:47:22.561Z","user":{"userId":"972932197","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tj F","accountLink":"/user/id/972932197"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The movie is good.

The story is not only enchanting and makes for great viewing, but it also enriches the way you view the first film as well. The songs are more mature in nature and may not be as ear catching as \"Let it go\", though with some repetitive viewings they might make their way into your Disney playlist. All in all, this is a worthy sequel to a movie that really didn't need one. But, after seeing it, you will be glad it did.","displayName":"David P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T03:29:59.896Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T03:30:13.603Z","user":{"userId":"915716195","realm":"RT","displayName":"David P","accountLink":"/user/id/915716195"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"loved it. glad I don't currently have kids, I can enjoy the soundtrack in peace","displayName":"DJ","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T03:26:03.691Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T03:26:03.691Z","user":{"userId":"E19F8F19-3AF1-4CCB-BB1D-5CD050A957F2","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"DJ","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"The first one was a lot better and the death scenes too dark for a childrenâ€™s movie.i was disappointed in the film .","displayName":"Joseph B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T03:20:26.461Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T03:20:26.461Z","user":{"userId":"2B3581FE-1D32-4816-9887-5A84CCFACE0C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joseph B","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Really good, funny movie to enjoy with the family.","displayName":"Daniela","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T03:15:24.424Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T03:15:24.424Z","user":{"userId":"91C45781-B781-4AB7-BE89-36064344CDB8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Daniela","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Exceeded my expectation and did even better than what I thought they could come up with. The concept idea is great into finding out about the past. We grow a connection with the the main characters and we get to know more about them. The songs are great and they put some emotion in all of them. Also a very funny movie and it definitely got some tears out of my eyes.
