Me and my children saw the first frozen when it premiered back in 2013 while we were at Disney for thanksgiving. This year we went to Disney around the same time and this movie happened to open the weekend we were there. Olaf’s cynical realism was absolutely what made this movie outstanding. I didn’t think it could be as good as the first movie i was sadly mistaken.
