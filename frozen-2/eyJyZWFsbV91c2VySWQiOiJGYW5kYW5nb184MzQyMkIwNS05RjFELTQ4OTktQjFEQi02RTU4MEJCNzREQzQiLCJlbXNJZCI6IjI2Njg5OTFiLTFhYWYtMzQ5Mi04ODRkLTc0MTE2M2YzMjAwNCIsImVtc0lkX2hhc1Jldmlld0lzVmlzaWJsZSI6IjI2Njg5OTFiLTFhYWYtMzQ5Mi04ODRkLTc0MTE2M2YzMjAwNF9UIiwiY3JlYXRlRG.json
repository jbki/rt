It's absolutely gorgeously animated, and the music is wonderful. The story feels very different to its predecessor, more serious and more complex, and it expands the world and the lore a bit more. It was very enjoyable to watch, but I think it didn't have quite the same impact as the first one. Perhaps because the first film was so new and fresh? I'm not entirely sure, but Frozen II is definitely worth a watch, and story-wise I think I slightly prefer it over Frozen.","displayName":"Coral B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T02:55:45.075Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T02:55:48.315Z","user":{"userId":"977922951","realm":"RT","displayName":"Coral B","accountLink":"/user/id/977922951"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Absolutely terrible.
