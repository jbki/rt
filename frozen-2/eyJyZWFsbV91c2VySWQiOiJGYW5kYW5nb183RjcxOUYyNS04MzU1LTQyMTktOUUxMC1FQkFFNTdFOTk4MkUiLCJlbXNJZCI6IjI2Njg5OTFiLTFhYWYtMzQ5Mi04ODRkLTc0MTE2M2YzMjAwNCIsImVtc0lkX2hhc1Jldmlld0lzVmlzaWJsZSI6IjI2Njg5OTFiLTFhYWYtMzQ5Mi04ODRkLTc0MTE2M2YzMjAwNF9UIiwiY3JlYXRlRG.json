I enjoyed all the songs, which were essentially parallels to the originals. Loved the feminism woven throughout the storyline, subtle but enough to make the whole movie feel fresh and modern. Kids will love it, parents will enjoy the jokes. The most important thing, besides reinforcing another kind of true love (parent-child bond) is that Disney honored the indigenous peoples of the area and involved them in producing and telling their history. This was a respectable thing to do, and it made me want to learn more. We’ve already pre-ordered the DVD because it’s a keeper.","displayName":"LA","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-17T08:18:29.328Z","updateDate":"2019-12-17T08:19:10.200Z","user":{"userId":"8F6D2C89-1523-48C9-A2C6-816293D69186","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"LA","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Never did watch the first FROZEN but FROZEN II was a GOOD movie!
