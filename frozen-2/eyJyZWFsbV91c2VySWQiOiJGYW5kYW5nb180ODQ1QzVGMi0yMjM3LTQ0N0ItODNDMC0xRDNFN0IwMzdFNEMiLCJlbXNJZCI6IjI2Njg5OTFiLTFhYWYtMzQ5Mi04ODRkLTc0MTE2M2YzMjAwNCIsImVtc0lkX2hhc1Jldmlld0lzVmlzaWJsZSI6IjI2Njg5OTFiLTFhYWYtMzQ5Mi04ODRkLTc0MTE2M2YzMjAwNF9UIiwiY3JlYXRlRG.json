The voice cast is as good as ever. Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel were great in their roles. Josh Gad’s Olaf can be annoying at times, but also pretty funny. The film’s plot is interesting. I was very curious for the most part. The songs don’t always rise to the heights of the first film, but a lot of them are pretty good. The biggest flaw of the film is it’s finale. The ending feels very rushed. It could’ve been fleshed out more. Also, it gets a little too predictable at times. Overall, this is a fine sequel. It isn’t as successful as the original, but works in its own way.
