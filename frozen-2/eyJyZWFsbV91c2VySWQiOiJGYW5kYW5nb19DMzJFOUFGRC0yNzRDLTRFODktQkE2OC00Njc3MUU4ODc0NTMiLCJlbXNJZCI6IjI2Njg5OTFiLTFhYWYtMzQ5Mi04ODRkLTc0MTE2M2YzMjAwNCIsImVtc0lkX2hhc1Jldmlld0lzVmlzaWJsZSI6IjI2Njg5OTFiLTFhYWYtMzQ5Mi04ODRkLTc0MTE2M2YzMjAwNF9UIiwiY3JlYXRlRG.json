Finishing unrelated missions to get to the final challenge. Too much magic and fantasy. Too much singing. They over did what was beautiful in the first. But failed at every turn. Felt forced and no emotions were genuine. We had to imagine the emotions rather than feel them. Ruined the brand. Such a pity. Probably good for kids. Not good for adults.
