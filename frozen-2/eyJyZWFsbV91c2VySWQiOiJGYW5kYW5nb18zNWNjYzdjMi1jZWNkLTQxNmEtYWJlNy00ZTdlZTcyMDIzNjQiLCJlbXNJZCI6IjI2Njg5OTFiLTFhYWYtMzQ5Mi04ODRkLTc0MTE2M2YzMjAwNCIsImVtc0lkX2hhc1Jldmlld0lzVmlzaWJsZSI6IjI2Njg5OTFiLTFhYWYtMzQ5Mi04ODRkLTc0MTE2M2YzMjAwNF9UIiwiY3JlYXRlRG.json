There were a little bit of Superman, a little bit of stereotypical teen quest for adulthood, a little bit of standard humor from the secondary character. Making the snowman never seemed so boring, even more when this snowman starts talking about scientifically proven facts only to sympathize with the older audience in the room. Basically there's a positive message of tolerance and peace, of a more mature critique taught that should push the new generation to embrace a reasonably different way for their future and the future of their society, looking in every case for the naked truth, whatever it may be. Literally an \"Historia Magistra Vitae\" suggestions, very usefull and strongly needed these times. But the entire quest is poor and banal, the songs very annoying and starting every three minutes of what. Not a real adventure, not a real quest. Maybe a clumsy attempt to animate a Bildunsroman, with the optimal dose of romance style, with fantasy, creativity and maturity quests. But no Blue Flower were in this opera, significantly. Also, The whole thing of the spiritual world is reduced to a mere magic thing fo everyone fun and surprise, when a different approach should have been more effective, giving to these spirits a meaningful role instead of a mere scenical presence for the FX impact. Totally a 2/5. Oh, cool choice to use the kulning for Elsa's calling , but I was laughing every time thinking about the fact it was used to call ovines, traditionally.","displayName":"Monica M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10218086227058960/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T09:52:45.140Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T09:55:15.029Z","user":{"userId":"978412161","realm":"RT","displayName":"Monica M","accountLink":"/user/id/978412161"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Relied too much on the music, which IMO, was not as good as the first.
