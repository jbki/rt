There were many parallels that you could connect. With that being said, the movie was entertaining all the way through. The CGI was great. The music was good, but not as good as the first. The story has some holes that make no sense. Overall, I enjoyed it though and recommend it.","displayName":"Ryan L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/15613824/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T17:10:01.060Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T17:10:05.294Z","user":{"userId":"966706681","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan L","accountLink":"/user/id/966706681"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"}]}
