The plot was interesting, perhaps over a young child’s comprehension, but enough to keep an adult entertained. Scenery was great. There wasn’t a stand out song like “Let It Go” that won’t leave your head, yet the music was very good. Sequels can be mediocre, yet Frozen II definitely was worth watching in our opinion!","displayName":"Vicki","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T18:07:35.632Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T18:07:35.632Z","user":{"userId":"2A756F25-0CBE-4D22-A25D-CD0C04029BBC","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Vicki","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Better than the first!","displayName":"Amy U","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T18:05:35.912Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T18:05:40.320Z","user":{"userId":"9B04CDE2-6B28-422F-B4D8-D5A300C96D84","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Amy U","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I felt like a beautiful continuation to the story","displayName":"Mouse","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T18:03:20.789Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T18:03:20.789Z","user":{"userId":"bd25d22e-7ddd-4330-bd37-85c1e88b1222","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mouse","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great movies for the whole family!","displayName":"Aks","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T17:46:25.895Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T17:46:25.895Z","user":{"userId":"c818e19d-3550-4295-afd4-8e124d0658cf","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Aks","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love the whole movie.

It passed the time, and was something to go see with the kids, but largely left me disappointed that it wasn't close to the first one.  I won't get into at length here, as there are articles for an against the political undertones to this movie, but suffice to say that I don't go to Disney kids movies to get a thinly veiled critique of imperialism.","displayName":"Michael G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T16:05:09.406Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T16:05:09.406Z","user":{"userId":"978498550","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael G","accountLink":"/user/id/978498550"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"brilliantly animated!","displayName":"Diane R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T16:04:23.305Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T16:04:23.305Z","user":{"userId":"2e329ef1-6c99-4fff-967b-1c05c2da4d3d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Diane R","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"}]}
