The music is chilling at times, the comedy is very surreal, the visuals are gorgeous, and the lore and world-building is absolutely fascinating!\n\nThe two things I didn't like were that there's a scene where Anna is misinterpreting some things said to her, even though she absolutely has more common sense than that. Also, there's some kind of lizard character that adds diddly squat to the narrative.\n\nOther than those gripes, everything else about Frozen II was great from start to finish. Great job, Disney. You got me to love a Frozen movie.","displayName":"Christian H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/545119485875623/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T15:58:28.610Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T15:58:34.104Z","user":{"userId":"978012663","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christian H","accountLink":"/user/id/978012663"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"}]}
