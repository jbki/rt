None of them were particularly memorable.  Worse than the songs, however, was how they were generally performed, rather like a stage show.  The characters posed and performed as if to an audience rather than trying to express their feelings as in pretty much any other musical.  This, while different, was distracting and someone should've caught it before putting the film out.  The ending resulted in a situation that I don't feel that the sisters would've settled for, but was ultimately satisfying.","displayName":"James P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T21:45:31.063Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T21:45:31.063Z","user":{"userId":"0519a359-b4ed-40d4-a155-04834aaf8e32","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"James P","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I liked the story and my daughter enjoyed the movie so much.

Though, if you ask me, although Disney REALLY wants \"Into the Unknown\" to be the next \"Let it Go\", that honour goes to a different song. It helps that this song has more elaborate animation compared to the one that's gunning for a \"Best Original Song\" Oscar. While the new characters could've used some additional development and it can feel a bit underwhelming that the movie, while still more complex than the first film, isn't a big action-packed epic like you might expect from the trailers, I did enjoy Frozen II for the most part and prefer it over the first film. Just be cautious with your expectations because you're either on board with the storytelling decisions of this movie or you're not and I didn't find anything narratively flawed compared to the last non-Pixar CGI Disney sequel, a movie I like but its ending really isn't as happy as the writers want you to think it is. Go see this movie before it becomes overrated.","displayName":"Jacob B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1541003829471993/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T21:42:54.527Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T21:42:54.527Z","user":{"userId":"970980105","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jacob B","accountLink":"/user/id/970980105"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"}]}
