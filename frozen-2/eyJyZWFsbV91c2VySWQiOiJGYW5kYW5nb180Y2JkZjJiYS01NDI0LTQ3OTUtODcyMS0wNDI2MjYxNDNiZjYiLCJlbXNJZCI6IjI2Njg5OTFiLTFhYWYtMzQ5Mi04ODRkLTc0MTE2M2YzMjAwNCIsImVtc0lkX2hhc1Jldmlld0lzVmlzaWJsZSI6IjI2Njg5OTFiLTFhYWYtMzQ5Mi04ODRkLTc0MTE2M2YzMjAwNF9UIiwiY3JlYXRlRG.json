The theatre for the price did not have reclining seats which was disappointing. And my wine cup that was not inexpensive either spilled because there was not a tray to place the drink. Only a cup holder that didn't fit the small plastic cup. The move was fantastic. Next time I will look at the details to ensure they are reclining seats.","displayName":"Sarah S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-11T17:35:17.093Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T17:35:17.342Z","user":{"userId":"be332a07-6bdb-4fd6-87c1-8fca86063a65","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sarah S","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Even better than the first Frozen.

With that said, the beginning doesn't flow as well as the prior -- all of a sudden Elsa 'wakes up' the forest, and very rapidly she, Anna, Kristoff, etc are on an adventure, leaving the townspeople in the capable hands of the trolls? It was noticibly forced. I do think it was probably a good choice to move through this part quickly given that the interesting parts of the story occur outside of Arendelle, but it just felt a little nonsensical.\n\nAlso, Anna and Kristoff's relationship was cute, but sadly reduced to Kristoff trying to ask her to marry him (and failing) throughout the whole movie. Just as Anna's role shouldn't be reduced to her love life (and isn't), Kristoff's role shouldn't be either. It was nice to see him be somewhat useful at the end, but overall rather disappointing. \n\nAnd Kristoff's power ballad?? Why?","displayName":"Michelle F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-11T16:26:34.364Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T16:26:42.937Z","user":{"userId":"978427428","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michelle F","accountLink":"/user/id/978427428"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing!!!
