I would more or less think that if you have loved the adventures of Anna and Elsa for the past six years, \"Frozen II\" is a definite must-see. While sequels have a harder time matching the originals, I feel \"Frozen II\" makes you love the characters more, leaving you wanting more adventures.","displayName":"Matthew O","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002982008288/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T03:09:40.807Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T03:10:01.266Z","user":{"userId":"920236782","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew O","accountLink":"/user/id/920236782"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My daughter and I LOVED Frozen II.
