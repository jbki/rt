The writing shines when Olaf is not on screen.  But everything about him steals focus from what works - including the incredible landscape visuals.  In the end, was this movie necessary?  Absolutely not.  Will audiences love it?  Yes.","displayName":"Matt W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T03:23:31.559Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T03:23:31.559Z","user":{"userId":"977945986","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt W","accountLink":"/user/id/977945986"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"better than the first one.","displayName":"bryan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T03:19:36.111Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T03:19:36.111Z","user":{"userId":"C84E4D01-97C5-4034-A7C2-4A022C99481B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"bryan","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Horrible songs... sounds of plagiarism throughout.
