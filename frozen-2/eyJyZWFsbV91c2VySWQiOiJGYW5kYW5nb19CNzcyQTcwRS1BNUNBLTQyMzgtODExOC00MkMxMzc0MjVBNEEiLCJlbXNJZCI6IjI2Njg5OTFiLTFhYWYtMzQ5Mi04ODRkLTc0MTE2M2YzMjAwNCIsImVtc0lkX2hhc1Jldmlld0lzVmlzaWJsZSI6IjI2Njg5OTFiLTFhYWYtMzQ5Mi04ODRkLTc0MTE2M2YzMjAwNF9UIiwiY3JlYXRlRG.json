Olaf steals every scene he's in and Kristoff finally gets a song of his own to show off Jonathan Groff's voice. Beautiful animation throughout, especially with water. There's a visually incredible scene near the end of the film that was so striking that the audience in my theater collectively gasped. I didn't love the new characters much but other than that this was a worthy sequel. My kids said they liked it better than the original!","displayName":"Luka W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T16:32:51.372Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T16:33:23.168Z","user":{"userId":"976967474","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luka W","accountLink":"/user/id/976967474"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Story, graphics, music perfect Disney!!!","displayName":"Roxanne B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T16:08:12.215Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T16:08:12.215Z","user":{"userId":"cc6536b2-4dba-4ef7-b4e9-0d083a792d89","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Roxanne B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Too much emphasis on the song","displayName":"Steffen F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T15:56:20.138Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T15:56:20.138Z","user":{"userId":"3E0FD167-1996-48E4-B66F-A9914459FB5C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Steffen F","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie was great, but slightly worse than Frozen.","displayName":"Dio W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T15:54:09.284Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T15:54:11.724Z","user":{"userId":"977861092","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dio W","accountLink":"/user/id/977861092"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was pretty good. Songs were good. But it was a very dark movie for children. It had a lot of complex adult themes about life and growing up and figuring things out. It may be above some childrenâ€™s level. For those wanting a fun colorful adventure like the first one be aware that this one is a darker more complex version of the first. Still fun and colorful, just more mature in theme.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T15:51:43.840Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T15:51:43.840Z","user":{"userId":"840632141","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/840632141"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"So great all the kids loved it","displayName":"Marlaay","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T15:44:11.506Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T15:44:11.506Z","user":{"userId":"34cc82d0-2027-415f-ac34-7a7de6b44637","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Marlaay","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great story line and some genuine humor","displayName":"Sara A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-19T15:43:00.056Z","updateDate":"2019-12-19T15:43:00.056Z","user":{"userId":"1ABCCAF0-2876-4DF3-AEAB-A884FEE9E16A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sara A","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2019"}]}
