Frozen II has amazing animation and music. For me there wasn't a song that would have been as catchy as Let it go but all in all liked the music more. But going to see it I didn't have very high expectations so I am sure my amazement reflects that, so I am not sure how the movie seems for someone with very high expectations.","displayName":"Mercedes J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T21:16:18.659Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T21:16:18.659Z","user":{"userId":"978477798","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mercedes J","accountLink":"/user/id/978477798"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Really loved it I likes it better then the first","displayName":"self","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T21:15:48.703Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T21:15:48.703Z","user":{"userId":"CDF9E136-6A25-4572-A02B-EB50764572F4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"self","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"We love the movie hope there is another","displayName":"Josh paoli","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T21:13:06.661Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T21:13:06.661Z","user":{"userId":"AF46124A-EC0D-40A4-9B5C-83FD2591213C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Josh paoli","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I found this film to be more complex than the original, with more abstract concepts.  Parents do not need to worry that their children have a new anthem to sing; rather, the music is even more evocative and sophisticated.  My blase 13-year-old daughter and I were equally captivated, and we both think it is quite wonderful.","displayName":"Shira S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/602847070/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T20:59:26.875Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T20:59:32.689Z","user":{"userId":"801271695","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shira S","accountLink":"/user/id/801271695"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I thought frozen 2 was great for a sequel! It has a lot of wonderful and powerful songs, great voice acting, beautiful and stunning visuals, and it’s a great way to spend an afternoon with some family or friends. The story was a tiny bit predictable in every plot twist they tried, but I didn’t mind since they were still good twists too the story. I loved how they explored Elsa’s ice power in the movie. There were truly some magical moments that made you gaze in wonder over the power of her magic! I do wish they had worked the elements in the story a tiny bit better, I was a bit disappointed in the direction they took with that, but I know it’s easier to sell toys with what they chose! Overall, great movie and I can’t wait to see more. Still waiting for a frozen/tangled crossover.","displayName":"Josh","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T20:25:04.551Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T20:25:04.551Z","user":{"userId":"4BA7A38B-2B00-4A2D-8B27-709CC77EA72D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Josh","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The story was good, the animation and colors we're great.
