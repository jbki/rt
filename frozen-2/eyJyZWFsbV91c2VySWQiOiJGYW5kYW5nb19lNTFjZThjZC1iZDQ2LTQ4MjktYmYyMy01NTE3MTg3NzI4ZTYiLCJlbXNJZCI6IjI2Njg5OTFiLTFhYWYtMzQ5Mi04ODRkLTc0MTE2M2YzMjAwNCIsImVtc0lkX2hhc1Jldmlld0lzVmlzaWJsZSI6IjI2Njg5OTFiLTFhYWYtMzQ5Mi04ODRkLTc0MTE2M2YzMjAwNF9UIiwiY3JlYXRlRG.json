Though, I will talk about the most recent movie I watched, which I saw over fall break, Frozen II. This movie I found surprisingly enjoyable. The songs, Olaf's depressing realization that growing up kinda sucks, and even the transformation of Elsa, this movie really hit it home. Usually, Disney sequels aren't really my favorite, but I did enjoy watching this film. The animation stayed true to the original, but the small details were noticeable, and the singing was of course, astounding. \"Some Things Never Change\" has got to be one of my favorites, and has been on repeat on Spotify. The cast as well, I never knew, has such personality. Probably because I was still a small child when I saw Frozen I, I never really cared about the cast, but the voice actors of this movie has such personality, and the chemistry works so well, which is a key factor in making such a good movie. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at this movie and would recommend it.","displayName":"Penny P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T04:13:56.336Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T04:14:06.236Z","user":{"userId":"978433464","realm":"RT","displayName":"Penny P","accountLink":"/user/id/978433464"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I enjoyed the overall storyline and the humorous parts. I did not feel the music was to the same level as the original.  I was overall disappointed by the lyrics and lack of \"catchy\" songs. But the important thing was the kids loved it. They laughed at all the cheesy jokes and comical scene which made the funny stuff even better. We all had a great time and enjoyed the movie experience.","displayName":"Franklin","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T04:13:34.401Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T04:13:34.401Z","user":{"userId":"2fb4e998-7bed-4df9-bc5d-f6498ef0e218","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Franklin","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love this movie!!!!","displayName":"Nathalia O","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10218209778249326/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T04:10:35.824Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T04:10:49.599Z","user":{"userId":"978433462","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nathalia O","accountLink":"/user/id/978433462"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I loved thehumor and the action, but most of all.
