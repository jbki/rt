She thinks it’s so so. This movie has a very similar feel to malificient which my niece said says is “ boring”. Too much adult theme and too much gloomy colors scenes. Maybe much like lion king felt too dark in color. Only Olaf is the breathe of fresh air in the movie. I think they made the movie to have a trilogy. I feel something to do about the parents. But if you like Malificent you will like this. Much the similar story. The music is not even close to the amazing music from the original. If I was a producer I would fire the songwriters and demand better. It’s very important for at least 1 good song. Just mediocre songs and the best of the bunch has too much a spooky sound. Just awkward.

The movie didn’t live up to its hype or predecessor: it tried too hard. Nothing new, only gave it 2 1/2 stars because of Olaf, the ONLY childlike character in the movie. Movie was too long, the storyline difficult to understand for a young child. Maybe next time my grandchildren will be delighted, sorry not this time Disney.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T14:09:39.194Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T14:09:39.194Z","user":{"userId":"260180100","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260180100"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie absolutely stood up to my expectations.

It's better than the original, it's as easy as that. The music kept it's level, the animation is simply the best in the world, the storyline is much more complex, in the best way possible. Moreover, I have to mention the humor is mesmerizing. Having loved the first movie, I had every reason to love it's callbacks in the second. So many laughs, it prolly is the funniest movie I've seen. All in all, frozen 2 gives an invigorating explanation of Elsa's powers, gets hold of multiple emotions in such a balanced way, and satisfies all my expectations that I've been having for six years.","displayName":" ","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1016831631828134/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T13:54:41.119Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T03:45:35.067Z","user":{"userId":"977453008","realm":"RT","displayName":" ","accountLink":"/user/id/977453008"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"}]}
