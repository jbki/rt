The level of detail in the animation was the best I have ever seen, parts of the film so well animated that they looked real. However the storyline and music didn't seem to resonate with me as much as the first film. Hence the 3.5 star rating.","displayName":"Mark B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T02:30:38.325Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T02:30:38.325Z","user":{"userId":"978455492","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark B","accountLink":"/user/id/978455492"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Kind of confusing and choppy.
