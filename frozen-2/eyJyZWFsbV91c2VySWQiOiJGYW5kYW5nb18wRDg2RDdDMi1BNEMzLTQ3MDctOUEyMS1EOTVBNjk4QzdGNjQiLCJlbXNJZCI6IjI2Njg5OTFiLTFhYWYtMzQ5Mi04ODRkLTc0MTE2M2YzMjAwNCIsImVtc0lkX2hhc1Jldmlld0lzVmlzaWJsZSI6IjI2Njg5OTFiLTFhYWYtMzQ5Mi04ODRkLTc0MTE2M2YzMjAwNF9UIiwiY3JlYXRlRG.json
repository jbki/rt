(Kudos to anyone who can name that film) Now you may be wondering why that is, well watch this film and you might realise why that is, a quality sequel is very hard to achieve. I avoided the original Frozen for as long as possible but once I cracked and watched it,I could not deny that it was brilliant, the songs were so catchy and the subversive plot was a refreshing take on a classic fable. The sequel however loses most of what made the first film so good. The plot itself feels thin at best and the film goes to great lengths to rewrite some of the more powerful themes from the first movie. The songs are mostly forgettable apart from a hilarious power ballad from Kristoff. Even with all the negatives it is still watchable, Olaf is hilarious, there are some brilliant disney Easter eggs and no one does a happy ending like Disney does. Overall it is not a bad film but it does feel unnecessary and more of a cash cow than a worth while continuation of the Frozen tale. I give it 3 out of 5 spirits.","displayName":"James S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T22:30:55.901Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T22:32:06.744Z","user":{"userId":"978259728","realm":"RT","displayName":"James S","accountLink":"/user/id/978259728"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's better than the first one","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T22:29:42.374Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T22:29:42.374Z","user":{"userId":"976516126","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976516126"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Olaf was hilarious, but the rest of the movie was just boring.
