Liked the on spot action and  the integration to our chairs. I do feel that 20.00 per ticket regardless of age puts family in an unfair position. You want to take your kids to a honest character driven value based film but expendables doesn't take into  account a 1 hr & 43 minute film up to 100.00  for a treat and add in other miscellaneous items as sodas and munchies.","displayName":"Cynthia","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T07:55:36.954Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T07:55:36.954Z","user":{"userId":"D65311C9-EBEF-4F12-AC41-F3A0404D1202","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Cynthia","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great story, amazing character development and stunning visuals.","displayName":"Mineh","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T07:35:47.004Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T07:36:44.673Z","user":{"userId":"0C0ECC22-61B8-4DFA-82D4-DB6CAE96881E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mineh","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"There were many moments throughout the film that made me emotional, between the animation and the music so wonderfully showing the progression of the characters through the story. The musical quality definitely stepped up, feeling more like a Broadway musical than perhaps the classic children's movie (an upgrade and welcome change, in my opinion). There was a lot of world building that answered many of the most glaring questions of the first movie and developed and rounded out the characters. Elsa in \"Show Yourself\" was a particularly moving scene and I look forward to watching the movie again and again just as I did the first. My little sister, who was a huge fan of the original movie, said she liked it even better than the first. I'm hoping that Disney will release an extended version with the cut scenes (some of which they placed in trailers), as seeing more of young Iduna and Agnarr would be an interesting way to further round out their backstory. Thoroughly enjoyed the bridge concept and the sisters settling into the roles they grew into.","displayName":"Megan P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1429504980587500/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T07:27:54.349Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T07:28:00.637Z","user":{"userId":"978412058","realm":"RT","displayName":"Megan P","accountLink":"/user/id/978412058"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The music and CG were so beautiful that actually made me cry.
