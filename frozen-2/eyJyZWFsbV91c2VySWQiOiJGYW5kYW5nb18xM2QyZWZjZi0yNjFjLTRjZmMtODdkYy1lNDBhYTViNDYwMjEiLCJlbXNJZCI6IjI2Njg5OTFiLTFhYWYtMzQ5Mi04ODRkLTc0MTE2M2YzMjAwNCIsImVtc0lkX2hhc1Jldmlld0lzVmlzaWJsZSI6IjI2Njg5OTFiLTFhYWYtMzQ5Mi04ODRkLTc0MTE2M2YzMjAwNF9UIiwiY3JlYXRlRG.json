I like how this one was more of elsa’s story while still give the other characters a big storyline. The songs were better than the first one and the whole movie was better than the first one.

This movie also answers a lot of the questions from the first one.","displayName":"Carlos","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T04:10:28.571Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T04:10:28.571Z","user":{"userId":"CD25C606-7536-4CBF-8E8F-95C17B38DD74","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Carlos","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I expected more from it..","displayName":"Escobed.mary57","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T04:06:52.265Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T04:06:52.265Z","user":{"userId":"2604BB5C-0993-4D62-ACB6-1E25F2B0BDCE","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Escobed.mary57","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"We were mesmerized from the start.

I'm confused why a few of the \"critics\" have said the plot was confusing. \nThe themes were great! Self-love, being true to oneself, daring to be different, following one's heart against what's comfortable, and secure relationships that allow for individuality and freedom to go on separate journeys. It's about being able to mourn a loss and move on in a healthy way, knowing that true secure love is always found within first. \n\nI could do without Olaf... but seriously the movie was really beautiful.\nVisually and spiritually. \nI liked it way more than the first.","displayName":"Claire M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002224945935/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T04:03:32.317Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T04:03:38.861Z","user":{"userId":"910906067","realm":"RT","displayName":"Claire M","accountLink":"/user/id/910906067"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It is very different from the original.
