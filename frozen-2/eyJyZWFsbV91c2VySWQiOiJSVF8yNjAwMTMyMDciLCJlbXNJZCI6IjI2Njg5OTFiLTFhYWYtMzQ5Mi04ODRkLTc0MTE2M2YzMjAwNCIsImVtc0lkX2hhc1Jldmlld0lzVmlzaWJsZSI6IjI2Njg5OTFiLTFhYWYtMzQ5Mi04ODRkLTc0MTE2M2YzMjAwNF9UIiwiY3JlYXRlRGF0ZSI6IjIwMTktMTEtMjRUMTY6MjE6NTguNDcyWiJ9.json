This movie was extremely well done from start to finish. My one critique would be that the story was a little too complex for younger viewers but that same complexity made it very enjoyable for adults. I prefer this movie to the first which I also love.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T16:09:16.573Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T16:09:16.573Z","user":{"userId":"260250759","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260250759"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I really liked this movie! It's fun it's funny and it's really beautiful. It's crazy how good animation looks now. Some of the things looks so real even tho they where not trying to make it look real. The story is good, the crew is looking back into the past and trying to fix some mistakes. I loved Olaf. He had really funny parts. He was pushed a little to hard in my opinion, but he had amazing scenes to make it up.","displayName":"Umair M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2396580707245241/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T16:07:14.518Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T16:07:20.726Z","user":{"userId":"978108331","realm":"RT","displayName":"Umair M","accountLink":"/user/id/978108331"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie feels so incredible.
