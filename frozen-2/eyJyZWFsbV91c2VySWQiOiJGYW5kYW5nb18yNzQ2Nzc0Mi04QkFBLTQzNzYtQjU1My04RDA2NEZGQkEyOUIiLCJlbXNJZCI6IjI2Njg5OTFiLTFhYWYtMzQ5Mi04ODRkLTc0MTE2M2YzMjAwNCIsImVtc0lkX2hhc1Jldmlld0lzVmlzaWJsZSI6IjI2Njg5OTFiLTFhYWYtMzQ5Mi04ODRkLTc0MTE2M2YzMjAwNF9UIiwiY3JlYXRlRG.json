The messages of do the next right thing and making up for our ancestors mistakes are timeless and meaningful. Elsa and Annas characters are nicely developed and show more depth and courage. But parts like Kristoffs song seemed a bit hokey or like a music video. The younger kids in the theater found parts to be absolutely hilarious and loved it. I was surprised that the main song is sung by Panic! at the Disco for some odd reason instead of using Idina Menzels beautiful version. I would have thought Disney would have learned that audiences want to hear Idina, not some other pop star singing the iconic song. Overall, the movie is good but we probably wont watch it on replay like we did with Frozen.","displayName":"English N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T00:39:42.464Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T00:39:42.464Z","user":{"userId":"74ad425d-0c34-4bd1-9c53-e7ea95f39569","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"English N","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was amazing and so pretty!
