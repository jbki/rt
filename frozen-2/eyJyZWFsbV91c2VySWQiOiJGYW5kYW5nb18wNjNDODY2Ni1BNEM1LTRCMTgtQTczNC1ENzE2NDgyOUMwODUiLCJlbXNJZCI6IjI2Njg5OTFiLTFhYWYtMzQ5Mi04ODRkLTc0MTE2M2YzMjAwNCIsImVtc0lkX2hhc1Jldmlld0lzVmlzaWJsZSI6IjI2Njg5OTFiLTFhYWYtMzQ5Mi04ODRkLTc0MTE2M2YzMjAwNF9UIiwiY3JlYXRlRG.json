The song choices even were better this time around. I love disney and their need of women empowerment but sometimes I feel men get lost too with disney so giving olaf and kristof more song and storyline excelled the movie past the story of two sisters. By far favorite was all the olaf comic relief, the Male characters stole the show in this.
