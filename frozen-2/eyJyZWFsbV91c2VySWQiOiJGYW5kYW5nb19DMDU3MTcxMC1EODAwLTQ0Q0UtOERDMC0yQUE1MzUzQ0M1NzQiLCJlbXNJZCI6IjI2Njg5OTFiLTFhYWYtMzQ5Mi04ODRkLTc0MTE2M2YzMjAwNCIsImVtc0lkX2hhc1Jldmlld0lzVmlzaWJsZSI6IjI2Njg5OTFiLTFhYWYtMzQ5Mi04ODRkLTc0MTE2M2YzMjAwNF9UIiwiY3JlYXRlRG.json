Kristoff unintentionally steals this film. His song about love and dedication speaks to a greater conversation about relationships and sacrifice. It also goes nicely hand in hand with Olaf’s goofy song about growing up. There’s a greater conversation about change in this film and evoking ‘the unknown’ that is at times reflected in the animation. A massive wall of impenetrable fog, an ice cave that reaches into the depths of the earth. When you reach out into the unknown, it reaches back. Unfortunately Frozen II decides to shelve those conversations about the struggles of change, and the dangers of reaching for answers buried in the past and opts in sisterly love. This wouldn’t be as big of a problem if all those previous conversations weren’t midway through their arcs, then unceremoniously dropped. Frozen II reaches partly into the unknown, but doesn’t let the unknown reach back.","displayName":"Jonathan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-01T03:23:22.951Z","updateDate":"2020-01-01T03:23:22.951Z","user":{"userId":"6E15ACCC-D92E-4071-8DC0-AD3CBB239486","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jonathan","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"3d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"We liked the music and Olaf and Sven and baby reindeer and the fire salamander.
