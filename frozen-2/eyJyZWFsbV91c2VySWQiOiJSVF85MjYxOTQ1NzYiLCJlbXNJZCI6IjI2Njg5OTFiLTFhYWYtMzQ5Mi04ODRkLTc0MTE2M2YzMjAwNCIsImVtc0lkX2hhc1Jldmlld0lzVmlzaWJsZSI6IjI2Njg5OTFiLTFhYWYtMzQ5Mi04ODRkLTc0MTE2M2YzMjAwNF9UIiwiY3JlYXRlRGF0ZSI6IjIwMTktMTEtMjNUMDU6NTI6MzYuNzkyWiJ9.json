It was absolutely beautiful. There were a few pot holes in the story and it was incredibly predictable. The story didn't have any stakes and so it got a little boring. The music was nice. There is no \"Let it Go\" in this movie and most of the songs are relatively forgettable. Kristoff has an 80s power ballad that (though funny)  fits in in no way with the story line and drags on a little long. Elsa has 2 belty songs that show off Idina's incredible voice but do nothing for Elsa's character. Anna's one song is relatively poorly written but is pretty I guess. To give you a taste it begins with \"Hello darkness\". Overall Frozen 2 did the job of entertaining me but I would probably not watch it again.","displayName":"Elijah G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2119592064979762/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T05:51:59.378Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T05:52:07.428Z","user":{"userId":"977382342","realm":"RT","displayName":"Elijah G","accountLink":"/user/id/977382342"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"much more action. more singing and new characters! amazing.","displayName":"jay","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T05:51:52.260Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T05:51:52.260Z","user":{"userId":"36098547-B383-4B96-9BDD-4C50B9B9452D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"jay","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Frozen 2 gives everything the first movie did best, but adds even more story and even more comedy to the mix.","displayName":"Devan H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/403441080218975/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T05:51:29.122Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T05:51:34.300Z","user":{"userId":"977922853","realm":"RT","displayName":"Devan H","accountLink":"/user/id/977922853"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I am an adult.
