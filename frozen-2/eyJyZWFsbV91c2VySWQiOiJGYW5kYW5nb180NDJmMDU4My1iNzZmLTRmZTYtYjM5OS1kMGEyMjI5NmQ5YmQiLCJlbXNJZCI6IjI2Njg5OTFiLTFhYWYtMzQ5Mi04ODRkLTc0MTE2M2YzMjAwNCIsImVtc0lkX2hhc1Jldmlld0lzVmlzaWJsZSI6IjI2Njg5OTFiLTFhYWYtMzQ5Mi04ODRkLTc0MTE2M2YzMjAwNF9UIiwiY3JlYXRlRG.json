Icing on the cake is teaching how opposing sides have great intentions, and the battle of learning that the one youve been fighting for had the history of causing ill will after all, and how to let the past be the past and choose to let that go and forge a path of peace. Great story that teaches and Disney captures it well.","displayName":"lori W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T05:36:51.941Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T05:40:12.398Z","user":{"userId":"b81e253b-2435-40db-9938-feef92271dc5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"lori W","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"one of the best sequels I've seen. had some of the same emotional moments the original did","displayName":"Jerry B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T05:35:32.955Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T05:35:32.955Z","user":{"userId":"7CDA81E7-4034-4B64-9DB0-605E857312AC","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jerry B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It was alright.
