The music was not catchy or memorable whatsoever. The story was pretty good for a sequel, but the fact that there was no active villain was a different viewing experience. It was also extremely predicable. Olaf saved the movie for sure. The scene where he caught people up to speed on the last 10 years was outstanding. Plus his constant banter kept us awake. None of us would ever see it a second time in the theater without question. My daughter would probably watch it again on TV sometime. There were a few deeper issues explored, I will give it that. However, the music being awful just couldn’t be overcome. The songs were literal snoozers with little to know effort of fun","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T14:53:38.896Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T14:53:47.824Z","user":{"userId":"260337668","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260337668"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"really liked the movie but my girls loved it which is the most important part. ages 6,7, and 12.","displayName":"Guillermo","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T14:53:21.118Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T14:53:21.118Z","user":{"userId":"80071A91-0991-45DB-B603-E757FD672699","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Guillermo","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The music that it was funny and amazing my kids loved it","displayName":"Jose C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T14:52:33.475Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T14:52:33.475Z","user":{"userId":"8EF981C8-7A78-445F-AFF7-E0CD207F34FF","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jose C","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I loved this sequel!!!
