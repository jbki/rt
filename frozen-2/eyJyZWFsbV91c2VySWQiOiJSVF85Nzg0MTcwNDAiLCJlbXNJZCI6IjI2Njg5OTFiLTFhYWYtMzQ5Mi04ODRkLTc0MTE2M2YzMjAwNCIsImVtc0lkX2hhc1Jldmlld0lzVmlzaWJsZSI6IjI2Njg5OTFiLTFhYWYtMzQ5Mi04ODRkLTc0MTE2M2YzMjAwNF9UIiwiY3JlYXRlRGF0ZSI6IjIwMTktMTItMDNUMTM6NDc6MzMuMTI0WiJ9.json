Frozen II truly felt like a well thought out sequel, not a cash grab movie pushed out immediately after the first did so well. The story was amazing and the characters' personalities stayed true to themselves. The movie was also quite funny, with various jokes put in place to entertain the adults, and some that's the kids would understand that were also great. As a fan of the first Frozen, I can say this sequel didn't let me down at all! It was amazing!","displayName":"Eli K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T13:45:31.066Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T13:45:31.066Z","user":{"userId":"146b119d-e57a-4999-b394-5f928094be6b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Eli K","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved the story line and the vibrant colors of the Princessâ€™s dresses","displayName":"Sandra A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T13:43:45.741Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T13:43:45.741Z","user":{"userId":"0768ECD7-5AA8-4081-9E4A-1C1A694AB0C3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sandra A","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"my grand daughter loved it!","displayName":"Jim D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T13:41:34.006Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T13:41:34.006Z","user":{"userId":"bc9f9569-41ea-42d7-bb59-0d7bc74aa9d3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jim D","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love everything about frozen II.

Olaf was funny and amused my little one. I thought the songs were pretty good, though not as memorable as the first film. I will say I had a good chuckle at the Kristoff solo song \"Lost in the Woods\" for its cheesy 80's ballad music video vibe.
