And the music was very well-done. I dare say, better than the first one :) The plot was a little vague though, and compared to the previous movie, the characters felt a little flat in this one (aside from Elsa). But if you’re looking for a film that showcases the artistic talent at Disney, look no further than this one!","displayName":"Mough Vee","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-10T21:03:01.589Z","updateDate":"2019-12-10T21:03:01.589Z","user":{"userId":"9EC132ED-21E5-486D-B2F3-9CD5A9653472","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mough Vee","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great sequel.

There was action, suspense, and a little romance.  Also, the songs were phenomenal and very well-written.  The storyline was clever, yet engaging.

Overall, I really enjoyed this second installment.","displayName":"Ashley S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-10T19:41:23.995Z","updateDate":"2019-12-10T19:41:23.995Z","user":{"userId":"978426425","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ashley S","accountLink":"/user/id/978426425"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it , it’s hard to make sequels as good or better than an original movie but Disney did just that !","displayName":"Nicole B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-10T19:30:28.547Z","updateDate":"2019-12-10T19:30:28.547Z","user":{"userId":"DE4550B6-F2D0-4173-92AF-460AFAD96EC3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Nicole B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 10, 2019"}]}
