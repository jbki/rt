It was confusing AND boring.  Worst of all, the music was utterly forgettable.  Nothing for the kids to sing after we left the theater.   Somehow, after all these years, they couldn't come up with a single song that recreated the magic of the first installment.  Idina Menzel's voice is a gift, but she is working with material that tries to be a cross between songs from Wicked with a pinch of Frozen thrown into the mix and the end result falls impossibly flat and misses the mark entirely.  Thank goodness for Olaf, who, single-handedly saves the film from disaster and earns the film its one star.  Save your money and watch Frozen again on Disney Plus!","displayName":"Andy A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T15:24:24.965Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T15:24:34.772Z","user":{"userId":"06649d47-2478-49b1-9d09-b7e099136c39","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Andy A","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Disappointing.
