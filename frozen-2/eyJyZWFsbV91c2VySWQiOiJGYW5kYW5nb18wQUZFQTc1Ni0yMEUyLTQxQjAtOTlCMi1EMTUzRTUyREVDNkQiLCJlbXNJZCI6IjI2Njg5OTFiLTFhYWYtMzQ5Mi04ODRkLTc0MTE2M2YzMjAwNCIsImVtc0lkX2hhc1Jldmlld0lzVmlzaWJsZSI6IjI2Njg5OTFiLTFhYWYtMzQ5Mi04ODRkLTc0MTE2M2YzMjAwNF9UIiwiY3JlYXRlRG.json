In qualche modo il film riesce a funzionare grazie alle ottime animazioni e ad un buon umorismo, ma il concetto di base del film fallisce fin dal principio. Manca di innovazione, riciclando i vecchi personaggi li inserisce semplicemente in un'altra storia: sembra di assistere a quei pessimi sequel dei classici Disney di inizio anni 2000, quelli che giustamente nessuno ricorda pi√π.","displayName":"Filippo V","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000006602032/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T22:14:54.256Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T22:14:57.338Z","user":{"userId":"969112755","realm":"RT","displayName":"Filippo V","accountLink":"/user/id/969112755"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's a great movie with a great storyline and soundtrack.

Most flaws with this film can be summarized by saying \"Usual Disney cheesiness \". Almost all of the characters have their own arc that ties neatly with the overarching theme of change. Frozen 2 also manages to stay engaging most of the way through and avoids the carbon copy that many Disney sequels suffer from. Some of the themes are simple enough for younger audiences but offer some complexity for older moviegoers as well. One of the more glaring flaws with this movie however is the ending, while it satisfies and concludes the characters story arcs in a great way it feels rushed and needed just a few more minutes to flesh it out.If you enjoy Disney movies in any capacity and looking for a fun enjoyable story that stands on its own and continues an ongoing story from the last film, this is a must watch! As a Disney fanatic this movie stands at an outstanding 9/10. However, if I were not as into the Disney brand as I am, some of the cheesiness and the pretty rushed ending lands an overall score of 7/10.","displayName":"Samuel  D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T21:31:48.351Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T21:31:48.351Z","user":{"userId":"978409954","realm":"RT","displayName":"Samuel  D","accountLink":"/user/id/978409954"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"}]}
