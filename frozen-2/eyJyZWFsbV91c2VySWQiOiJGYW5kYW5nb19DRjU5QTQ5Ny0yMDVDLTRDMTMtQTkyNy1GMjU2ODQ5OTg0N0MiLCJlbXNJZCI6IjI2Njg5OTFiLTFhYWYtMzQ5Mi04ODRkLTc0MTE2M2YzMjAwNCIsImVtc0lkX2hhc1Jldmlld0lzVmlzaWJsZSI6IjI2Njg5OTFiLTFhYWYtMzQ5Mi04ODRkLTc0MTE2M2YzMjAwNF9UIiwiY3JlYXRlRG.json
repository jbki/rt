If you are blanking on what I’m talking about, cue up Travolta at the 2014 Academy Awards introducing Menzel’s performance of Frozen’s Let It Go (which took home the Oscar for Best Song). Her voice is divine, a Heavenly treat, ear candy....add your superlatives. I did enjoy a few songs from Frozen 2 but most left me wishing I’d subscribed to the new Disney Plus service on my Apple TV so I could stream Frozen the original and just keep replaying Let It Go. Tip: be sure and stay through the credits so you can hear Kacey Musgraves sing All is Found. It’s already #1 on my iPhone Frozen 2 song list. Plus there is a funny Olaf and friends bonus clip at the very, very end, yes, after the “Caffeinated Team” listing. What is that? Starbucks runners? The musical show stopper was a mother/daughter duet, Show Yourself, featuring Idina Menzel (Elsa) and Evan Rachel Wood (Queen Iduna) at a carpe diem turning point for Elsa. Tracking a mysterious lilting voice, Elsa travels beyond the kingdom of Arendelle in order to discover the source of her magical powers and to learn the truth about her family’s past. Show Yourself musically accompanies Elsa on her dangerous journey, peaking as she plunges into the raging Dark Sea. There she encounters and tames the Nøkk, a water spirit that shapeshifts into a magnificent white stallion and brings her safely to Ahtohallan. Show Yourself is #2 on my song list. That’s it. A short hummable set. Perfect. Ultimately Elsa, Anna, Sven, Olaf and Kristoff together will be called upon to set things right as it relates to the neighboring tribe of Northuldra and, in doing so, save Arendelle. Elsa’s quest for self-discovery, Anna’s sisterly protection of Elsa, Kristoff’s romantic pursuit of Anna and the unfortunate melt-down of Olaf all factor into a fairly complicated Frozen mythology of kings, queens and kingdoms; enchanted forests, trolls and spirits; and, personification of elements—Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. There are so many new characters and creatures introduced in this sequel that if (when) there is a Frozen 3, CliffsNotes will be sold as a popular concession item right beside popcorn and Skittles. The Frozen 2 animation and cinematography was exquisite and dazzling at times—the Earth Giants, the Nøkk, and Elsa’s frozen magical moves are prime examples. At other times, the technology was not so splendid. Olaf reminds me of a craft kit of cotton balls and toothpicks designed to be an easily manufactured stuffed animal. Bruni, a sweet, tiny salamander is super cute but so simple it would go well as a black line master in a Frozen 2 toddler’s coloring book. The ice sculpture images are reminiscent of a Macy’s Christmas Window themed around Department 56 Snowbabies. The last fifteen minutes of the film salvaged a tedious first half snooze fest. IMHO Disney can do better.
