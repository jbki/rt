At least the first one had some unexpected twists. Frozen II's plot could've been that of a phoned in TV special for middle schoolers. Much of the dialog consisted of overly sentimental tropes with some tacked on comic relief. The songs were good, but most of the time there was nothing important going on on-screen, instead just close up shots of a cartoon character belting out lyrics. Compare that with the storytelling and action in older Disney classics like Jungle Book, Aladdin, or Mary Poppins and it's just not even close. The musical sequences in those movies don't just tell you what's going on with the song lyrics, they convey through the choreography why the characters feel the way they do and take the actions they take, whereas you just have to take Elsa's word for it that she likes \"going into the unknown\" as she runs around in the snow for no particular reason.\n\nI will say, the animation was spectacular. From the slight wrinkles and pills in the fabric of Anna's nightgown to the unbelievably realistic water animation, this movie is probably one of the greatest technical achievements ever in 3d animation. I just wish it had a more cohesive of a story and more fleshed out characters to draw in the adults in the audience.","displayName":"Ian K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T04:56:33.293Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T04:56:33.293Z","user":{"userId":"766476b4-e953-4457-acc9-ba9e40b1b4c0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ian K","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Not nearly as good as the first.

While the original was about Elsa learning to control her powers, the sequel is about Elsa finally learning to love herself, powers and all. Anna's momentous ballad of grief and loss is something that anyone will be able to able to relate to. Kudos to Disney for this incredible story about Bad B*tches.","displayName":"Maddie B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T04:46:34.272Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T04:46:34.272Z","user":{"userId":"ECED26E1-E0F8-4090-9E8F-F93D5FA46205","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Maddie B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"As good if not better than the first!","displayName":"BR","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-16T04:42:01.775Z","updateDate":"2019-12-16T04:42:01.775Z","user":{"userId":"720b9502-9b79-46a0-8f49-2419882e6589","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"BR","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!
