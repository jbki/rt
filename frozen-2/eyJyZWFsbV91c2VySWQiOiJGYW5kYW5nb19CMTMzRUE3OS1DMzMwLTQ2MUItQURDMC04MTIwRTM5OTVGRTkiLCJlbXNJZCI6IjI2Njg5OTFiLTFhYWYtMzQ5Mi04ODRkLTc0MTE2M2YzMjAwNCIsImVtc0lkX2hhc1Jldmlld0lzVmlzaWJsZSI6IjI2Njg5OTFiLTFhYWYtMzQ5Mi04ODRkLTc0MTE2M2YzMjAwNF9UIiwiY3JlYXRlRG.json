Way better than the 1st movie! The music was better! The animation was gorgeous! You could really see how much the characters in this movie care for each other by the lengths they go to, and the world-building and mythology in this film are great! The 1st one was better thematically, but this one is better emotionally. I thought the 1st one was meh and the characters were kind of bland and lacked motivation. If you didn't like the 1st one all that much or don't really plan on seeing it, I definitely recommend you see this one.","displayName":"Micayla B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T20:54:59.327Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T20:55:02.238Z","user":{"userId":"978404480","realm":"RT","displayName":"Micayla B","accountLink":"/user/id/978404480"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"tne ending was not what i expected.

As a big Disney and Frozen fan...i honestly found it mediocre... as to plot ( exactly like Maleficent 2) and not one song the caliber to the first movie. and frankly....SPOILER.......... getting tired of the handoff of title  (Cap to Falcon), (Thor to Valkyrie ), ( Woody to Jessie)... boring and predictable now. but to release it with not one catchy amazing song...would not have predicted that. Visuals were beautiful, better than the first . I expected the sequel to be lesser, but overall , i'm disapointed. not bad...not great,","displayName":"Donna H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000205809589/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T20:51:28.088Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T20:51:39.745Z","user":{"userId":"885895630","realm":"RT","displayName":"Donna H","accountLink":"/user/id/885895630"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A bit tired in places but overall well worth it.","displayName":"Joshua Rice","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T20:51:20.189Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T20:51:20.189Z","user":{"userId":"38EAEEAE-564A-42D7-B446-2507833D94DA","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joshua Rice","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Frozen 2 was great!
