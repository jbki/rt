The best part is that the movie doesn't need a villain to be a good movie. Just the drama that is presented between every character is enough to drive the plot. This movie isn't a normal kids movie it is for everyone that is shone in the music. The songs add a more majority to the movie that wasn't in the first. And not just the singing parts even the orchestral songs. But the movie still has a good plot that kids will still enjoy.","displayName":"Ben H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T03:04:16.331Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T03:04:42.958Z","user":{"userId":"978404873","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ben H","accountLink":"/user/id/978404873"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"actually better than the first one.","displayName":"John","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T03:03:33.460Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T03:03:33.460Z","user":{"userId":"35F0F22E-B2EE-4AC0-AA8E-D657180BF096","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"John","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Wow, canâ€™t believe these reviews.
