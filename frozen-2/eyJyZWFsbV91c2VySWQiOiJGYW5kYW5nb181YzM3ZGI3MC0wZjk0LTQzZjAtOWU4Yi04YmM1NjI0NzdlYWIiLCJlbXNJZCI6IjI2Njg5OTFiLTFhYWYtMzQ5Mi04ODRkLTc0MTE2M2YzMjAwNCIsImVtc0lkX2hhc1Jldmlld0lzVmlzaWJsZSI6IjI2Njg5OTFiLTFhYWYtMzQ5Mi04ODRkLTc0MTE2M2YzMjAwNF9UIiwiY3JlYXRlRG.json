I went with my 5 year old daughter, who has loved Frozen since she was a toddler. I happened to hit the sweet spot during Frozen madness. Although, some of the storyline went over her head, she totally enjoyed the movie & experience of seeing on opening night with a bunch of other younger children. Id recommend it to any of you Frozen fans out there.","displayName":"Elizabeth  F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T11:48:42.900Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T11:48:42.900Z","user":{"userId":"fe5eac5f-9011-4c79-8ebb-694fd8fa9857","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Elizabeth  F","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Really liked the theme and special effects","displayName":"Arthur","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T11:41:04.630Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T11:41:04.630Z","user":{"userId":"a74a0e07-fa4d-48f8-82f3-e323dc0553ea","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Arthur","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was awesome my kids also loved it lol","displayName":"troy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T11:39:47.874Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T11:39:47.874Z","user":{"userId":"1071790f-2602-4783-9826-94f6cf85a326","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"troy","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Such a good movie!

I think it threw a lot of people off, but wow, was it the right thing to do.\n\nI think some people wanted it to go in the opposite direction -- to be more meta and self-aware?  The first movie was so instantly notable because it was \"a clever deconstruction\" on the classic Disney princess-falls-in-love story.  It was candy, and it veered a little too close to the knowing wink-wink-nudge-nudge of Shrek and Wreck-It Ralph, if you ask me.\n\nThis movie is not that.  They ditched the theme park and went off into the endless existential wilderness, and the results are... spectacular.  And slightly unnerving.  And incredibly beautiful. \n\nSome of the imagery at the end of the movie is the most gorgeous i've ever seen.  And i was unbelievably impressed at the austerity and restraint in the visuals...\n\n... i mean, the previews before the movie were for more typical CGI abominations like Onward, Spies in Disguise, and Scoob!, and those movies just look cluttered, oversaturated, and toylike compared to the autumnal grandeur of Frozen II.\n\n\"Lost in the Woods\" is hilarious.  My god. \n\nOlaf is a much better character this time. \n\nElsa, the dark ocean, the cave.  Legendary.  Where have we ever seen anything quite like this before?\n\nMy only complaint is that it seemed too short, a little abbreviated?  It seemed like some of the secondary characters and parts of the journey could have been beefed up more -- i think this movie could have been even better as a 2:20 monstrosity, instead of the streamlined 1:40 delight that it is.  \n\n^__^\n\nI am going to watch this movie so many times when it comes to Disney Plus.  I'm just gonna have it on in the background all the dang time.","displayName":"Marc L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1136623993175277/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T11:31:36.749Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T11:31:44.620Z","user":{"userId":"977891559","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marc L","accountLink":"/user/id/977891559"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Surprisingly enjoyed the movie","displayName":"Aristo","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T11:29:32.119Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T11:29:32.119Z","user":{"userId":"98d7d2e9-95dc-4914-be48-14df264c07e9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Aristo","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Corny no where near as good as the 1st one.
