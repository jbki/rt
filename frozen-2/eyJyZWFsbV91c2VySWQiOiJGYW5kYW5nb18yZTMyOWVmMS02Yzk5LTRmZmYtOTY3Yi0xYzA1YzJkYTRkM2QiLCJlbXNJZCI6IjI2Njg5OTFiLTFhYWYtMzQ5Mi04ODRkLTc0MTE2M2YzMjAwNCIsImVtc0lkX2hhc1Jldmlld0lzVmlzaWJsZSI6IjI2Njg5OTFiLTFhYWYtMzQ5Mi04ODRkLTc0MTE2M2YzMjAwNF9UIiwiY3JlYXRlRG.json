But if their target audience was children, I was with a 4 year old and this movie did NOT hold his attention. He was really excited to see it but there were too many slow moments. Too many \"I am trying to transform and grow and be introspective\" songs. Which was even a bit of a snoozefest for myself as an adult. I could only imagine how little my 4 year old understood it. He liked the scenes with Sven and Olaf though. The music was okay. I really think they struggled to come up with other memorable songs. It would be difficult to produce a hit as big as \"Let It Go\" but \"Into The Unknown\" comes very close. It was very powerful and moving. I especially liked the \"Aurora\" parts. But I don't remember any of the other songs in the movie though and I saw it two days ago. I know, sequels are hit or miss. I will not be purchasing this movie for my collection as I did with the first one. Like I said, it wasn't terrible. But it missed the mark for me because of the monotonous moments and how they didn't translate well for children.","displayName":"Marie N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/145901129/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T15:53:36.333Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T15:53:40.493Z","user":{"userId":"782445611","realm":"RT","displayName":"Marie N","accountLink":"/user/id/782445611"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very good story line all families have a history, some are the best part of DNA","displayName":"David","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T15:42:50.020Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T15:42:50.020Z","user":{"userId":"08740278-D226-4980-9580-3818BCE06420","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"David","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"You will never beat the original Frozen but Frozen II is still pretty good and the kids will love it.","displayName":"Rachel S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/507140781/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T15:19:33.032Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T15:19:48.881Z","user":{"userId":"915219210","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rachel S","accountLink":"/user/id/915219210"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Frozen II Pros: Fine Voice Acting Stunning Animation Decent Directing Passable Editing OK Soundtrack Cons: Poor Plot Weak Screenplay Mediocre Pacing Bad Humor Character choices that feel out of place Overall Grade: C (5/10)","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T15:14:26.479Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T15:14:26.479Z","user":{"userId":"963227027","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/963227027"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent movie.

The story is based on nothing but magic and some random thoughts. The only good thing is that humans exist. Be real and make a film based on reality and give it a deserved happy end and than we might like it cause in real life things aren't that pink.","displayName":"Anna I","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3010278325864267/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T14:15:21.995Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T14:15:21.995Z","user":{"userId":"978389739","realm":"RT","displayName":"Anna I","accountLink":"/user/id/978389739"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good story line and great animations.","displayName":"Fan!","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2020-01-02T13:17:48.904Z","updateDate":"2020-01-02T13:17:48.904Z","user":{"userId":"4a8130a3-1cd0-4334-af36-ff8c5dd09286","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Fan!","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"2d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved this movie!!
