Some of the beloved characters from the first movie didn't have an important roll in this movie and some of the deliberate choices made by the director made this movie even more disappointing than it already is. The humour, also, wasn't delivered well by the characters. The beautiful animation and the catchy songs really saved this movie from being unwatchable.","displayName":"h m","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T10:37:22.839Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T10:38:03.452Z","user":{"userId":"978290579","realm":"RT","displayName":"h m","accountLink":"/user/id/978290579"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"disliked - story to complicated, liked animation","displayName":"Linda W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T10:11:54.717Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T10:11:54.717Z","user":{"userId":"666b26c6-e5e9-4da9-ae84-265f17edf0b5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Linda W","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The music was good and so was the plot line.","displayName":"A C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T10:08:24.131Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T10:08:24.131Z","user":{"userId":"a32580e0-2c54-4ac2-b306-a39e2db59921","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"A C","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"it's was a good nice","displayName":"John","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T09:49:51.586Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T09:49:51.586Z","user":{"userId":"F3CD8B8B-FC33-473F-915F-119FF2874C39","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"John","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"FROZEN II is a stunning film that surpasses the first. The story is definitely darker and more sophisticated and the animation is stunning to behold. The music also works well in the film and are definitely great new additions to the franchise. Even though the film does go at a decently fast pace, so much is accomplished and emotion is felt, with not a single dull moment, that I didn't mind the faster pacing. This film is definitely the most gorgeous Disney animated film I've ever watched and impressively adds to that last.","displayName":"Leo L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T09:40:01.650Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T09:40:57.408Z","user":{"userId":"976130346","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leo L","accountLink":"/user/id/976130346"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"LOVED THIS MOVIE.
