And while there is certainly some of that here it unfortunately doesn't feel as gratifying, as some character's make truly mind-bending choices and others have no real use at all. Songs are catchy, but none really feel as grandiose or ear-wormy as that of the first film. At the end of the day, Frozen 2 should please die hard fans, however even they may question if the franchise has already begun to melt in the sun.","displayName":"Eoin M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/656332743/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T23:02:41.723Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T23:03:51.163Z","user":{"userId":"906934341","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eoin M","accountLink":"/user/id/906934341"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great stories about being true to who you are and supporting each other.

The story line was boring and had very little impact and was super predictable. Jokes were okay. There was singing every 5 minutes to the point that I felt like there was more singing than dialogue. One of the peaks of the movie was literally just Elsa getting a wardrobe change + typical princess treatment.... I really expected a lot more from Disney. The animation was amazing, but the transition between scenes just felt choppy and I had very little attachment to the plot line overall. Rough sequel, Olaf's Frozen Adventure was tons better.","displayName":"Jennie N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1385829021/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T23:01:49.530Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T23:01:54.988Z","user":{"userId":"937054158","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jennie N","accountLink":"/user/id/937054158"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It was okay but just seemed to kind of drag on.","displayName":"Susan B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T22:59:47.678Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T22:59:47.678Z","user":{"userId":"69a1f939-bb18-4ff1-bdaf-85f8d28f443c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Susan B","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A great innovation on the original!
