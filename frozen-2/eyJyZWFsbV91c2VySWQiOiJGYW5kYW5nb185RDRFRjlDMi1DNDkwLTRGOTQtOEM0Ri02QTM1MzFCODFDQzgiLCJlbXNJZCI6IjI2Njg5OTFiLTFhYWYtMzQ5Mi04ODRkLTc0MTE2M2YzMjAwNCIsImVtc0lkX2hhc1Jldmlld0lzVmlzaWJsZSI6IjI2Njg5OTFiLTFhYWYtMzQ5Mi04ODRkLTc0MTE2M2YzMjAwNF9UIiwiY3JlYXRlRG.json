The story from the first movie was taken forward in a surprising way. The plot and character development were solid. The songs were good as well. We ended up seeing the movie in 4DX. The theater effects were a bit much and were a distraction at times. See the movie, but pass on 4DX.","displayName":"Jonathan R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T05:15:16.391Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T05:15:16.391Z","user":{"userId":"e1116746-4eb6-41a4-808f-b45e1cb32b3f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jonathan R","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I thought it was a good sequel. the songs are not as memorable, but still a good story.
