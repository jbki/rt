They clearly wrote a longer story than could fit in the movie (the soundtrack has a bunch of songs that couldn't fit including back-story songs) and so it can feel jumbled and rushed at the beginning but when I watched it a second time I loved it even more than the first. I love this movie. Somehow it affected me deeply.","displayName":"Jamie B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/724868271/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T05:13:10.892Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T05:13:17.803Z","user":{"userId":"906494877","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jamie B","accountLink":"/user/id/906494877"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great story great movie from start to finish","displayName":"javier","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-05T05:09:48.587Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T05:09:48.587Z","user":{"userId":"E4AB4BB3-4780-4F1F-9706-BFD7E2BDB3C4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"javier","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!
