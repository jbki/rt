The best I got out of it was \"don't be a lying dick\", that's it. I'm not asking for some moral lesson, I just wanted Frozen 2 to be about something that isn't as vague as \"sisterly love\" and \"getting along with people\". I'm sure kids will like this movie but if you aren't 11 you are going to be disappointed, it's nothing like old Disney, the story was the most generic it could be. The fact that this supposed to be \"original\" as when compared to the stories Disney adapted, it's a joke it feels like it was written within an afternoon and no revision or discussion was had on what is supposed to be the driving force of the story. Frozen 1 was a more complete story than this.","displayName":"Ram B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2524913147736847/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-11-23T03:39:31.435Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T03:39:38.675Z","user":{"userId":"978304064","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ram B","accountLink":"/user/id/978304064"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Stunning!
