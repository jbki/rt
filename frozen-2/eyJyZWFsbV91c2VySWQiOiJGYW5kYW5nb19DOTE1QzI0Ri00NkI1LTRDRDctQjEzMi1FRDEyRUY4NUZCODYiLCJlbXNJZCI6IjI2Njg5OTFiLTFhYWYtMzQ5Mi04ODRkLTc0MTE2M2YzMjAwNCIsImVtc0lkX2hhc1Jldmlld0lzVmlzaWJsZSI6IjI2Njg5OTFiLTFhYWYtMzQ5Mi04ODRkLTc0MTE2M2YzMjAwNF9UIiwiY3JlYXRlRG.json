It is a confusing mix of narrative with no real idea as to where it was going.\n\nAll over this are elements of a \"too many chefs\" syndrome. There are lots of 'creative' ideas that have been fudged together so that they fit into the plot. Unfortunately, this kind of movie making by committee is far to common nowadays. \n\nIf you disagree try explaining the plot to someone who hasn't watch the movie - they'll fall as sleep before you finish.","displayName":"David M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/204501131/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T16:04:55.272Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T16:05:05.490Z","user":{"userId":"918547760","realm":"RT","displayName":"David M","accountLink":"/user/id/918547760"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was good, nice storyline","displayName":"Frank","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T15:49:28.760Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T15:49:28.760Z","user":{"userId":"4d430352-bfcd-4062-b680-3fdf5d79792b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Frank","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was such a cute movie!!
