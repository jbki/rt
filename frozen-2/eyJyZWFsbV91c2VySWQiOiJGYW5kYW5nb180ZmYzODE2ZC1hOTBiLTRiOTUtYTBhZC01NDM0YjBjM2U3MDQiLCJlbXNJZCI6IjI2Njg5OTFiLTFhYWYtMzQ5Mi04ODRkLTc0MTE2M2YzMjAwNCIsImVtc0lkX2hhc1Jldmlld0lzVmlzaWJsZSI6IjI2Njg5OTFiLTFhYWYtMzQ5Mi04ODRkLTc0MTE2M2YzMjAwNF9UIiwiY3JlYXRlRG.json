It's stunningly beautiful; Disney has taken the animation up another level, especially the trees and water. Evan Rachel Wood and AURORA are good additions to the voice cast. Kristoff gets a real song, instead of a late addition that was put in the film when the filmmakers realized they hadn't given him anything. It's another strong story that touches on a lot of the same themes while remaining original. And the trolls, my least favorite characters from the first film, get less screen time.\n\nOn the other hand, it has the usual sequel problem: things aren't as fresh and new as they were the first time. None of the songs reach the same level as Let It Go, though that's like saying that not every baseball hit is a walkoff home run in game 7 of the World Series.\n\nIf you like Disney animation at all, Frozen II is a must see. If you have young girls in the family you won't have a choice.","displayName":"Shirley M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/15843/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T07:46:37.998Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T07:46:48.481Z","user":{"userId":"922012124","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shirley M","accountLink":"/user/id/922012124"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The song is very good.
