I am a huge Disney movie fan anyway, and I figured there would be a lot of songs, but I know not everyone appreciates that in films. I will say that the entire tone of the movie is more serious and deep than the first while still being its bright disney self. It answers a lot of questions that the first movie left unanswered, such as where did Elsa get her powers from, and the animators even left a little nod towards one of the fan theories of how Frozen and The Little Mermaid are linked (this movie debunks it, but if you pay attention to detail, you'll see what I'm referring to). There is HUGE character development for Anna, which I was very happy to see, especially seeing her act independently from her sister. Overall, I would for sure recommend this movie and would be glad to watch it again.","displayName":"Lani O","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/711033422/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T05:07:17.172Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T05:07:34.682Z","user":{"userId":"922417581","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lani O","accountLink":"/user/id/922417581"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"}]}
