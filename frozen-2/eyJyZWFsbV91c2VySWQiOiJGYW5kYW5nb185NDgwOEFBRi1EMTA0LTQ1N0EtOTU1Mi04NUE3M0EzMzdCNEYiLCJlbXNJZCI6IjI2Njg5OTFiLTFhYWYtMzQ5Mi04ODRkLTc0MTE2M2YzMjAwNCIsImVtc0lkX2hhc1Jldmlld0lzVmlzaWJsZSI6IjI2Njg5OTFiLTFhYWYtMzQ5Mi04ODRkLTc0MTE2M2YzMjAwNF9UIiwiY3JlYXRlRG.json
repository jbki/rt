I really liked \"Frozen 1\", so I was excited and worried, I didn't want it to be just a usual sequel, something not a good as first movie. Well, I have to say, I am blown away by this movie. Like the first \"Frozen\", it has glorious animation, awesome songs which would be heard for years to come - but this particular movie has VERY ADULT themes like death, betrayal, longing, transformation and Resurrection. Same very philosophical topics you can find in the Bible. Actually, watching this movie was almost a religious experience for me. I should be ashamed to admit it, because it is still a freaking Disney cartoon for kids, and I am supposedly an educated adult who should not look for a religious philosophy in a cartoon-  but I am not ashamed. This movie gave me chills and goosebumps. Everyone should see it.","displayName":"Mikhail S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000552072227/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T06:41:50.644Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T18:29:09.641Z","user":{"userId":"908435789","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mikhail S","accountLink":"/user/id/908435789"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I LOVED IT SO MUCH!!!
