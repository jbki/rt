The new premise looked very promising and the first half of the movie was super fun and interesting. After Elsa and Ana leave by themselves, the movie just goes downhill. The emotional moments and resolution are very lackluster and the process is based on unfounded assumptions and luck. The songs were also nothing like the original. I would still recommend just because of the first half.","displayName":"Josu O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-14T20:36:32.690Z","updateDate":"2019-12-14T20:36:40.313Z","user":{"userId":"978318123","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josu O","accountLink":"/user/id/978318123"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"my favorite animated Disney movie. great story, great music, just great.","displayName":"Nicholas R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-14T20:30:40.313Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T08:31:56.515Z","user":{"userId":"66521477-2DC9-4712-98DD-773ED2F71607","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Nicholas R","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the first movie.
