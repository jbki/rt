You should watch the 1st one to get some of the jokes but it’s not necessary. This has the same exact blueprint of the first one but it’s more adventurous and “mature”. Olaf has me laughing every time he came on the screen.. the meaning of Elsa’s quest is great and the I was fully satisfied with the ending! (I can’t wait for Frozen 3 now!) Oh and the music with the visuals was amazing. 6 out of 5 stars, thank you Disney!

This movie actually makes the first one better in that respect. There were some great moments. Anna's song in the cave really got me in the feels as someone with depression. It loses a couple stars for 2 reasons that may or may not be related. First, the evil white man vibe feels heavy handed. I'm not against narrative morality, but this interfered with the structure. I don't like pandering to China any more than to SJW's. My native Alaskan in-laws felt the same. Along that line, Kristoff's arc was completely flat. He goes from anxious attachment style to secure attachment style with no evidence or support for that change. In a movie so heavily themed on \"transformation,\" how you gonna make the only male character so blatantly unidimensional? Is sexism a zero sum game? Is this what we've come to? Do better Disney.","displayName":"Jordan B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T08:01:23.237Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T08:01:28.332Z","user":{"userId":"978473307","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jordan B","accountLink":"/user/id/978473307"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Good for one time watching because only visuality animation quality 3d effects are good first half bore climax just okay above average film","displayName":"Chandu R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-24T07:55:43.195Z","updateDate":"2019-12-24T07:55:45.981Z","user":{"userId":"977453245","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chandu R","accountLink":"/user/id/977453245"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2019"}]}
