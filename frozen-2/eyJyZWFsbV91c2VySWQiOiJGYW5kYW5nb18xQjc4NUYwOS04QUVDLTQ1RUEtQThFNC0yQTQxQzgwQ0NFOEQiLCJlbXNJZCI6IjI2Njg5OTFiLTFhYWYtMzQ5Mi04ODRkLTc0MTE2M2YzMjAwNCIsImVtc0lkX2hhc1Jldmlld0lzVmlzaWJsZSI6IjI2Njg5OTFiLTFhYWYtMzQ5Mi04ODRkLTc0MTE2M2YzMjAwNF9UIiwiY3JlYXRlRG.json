It feels not only like a continuation, but an escalation of the story.\n\nThe cast hasn't lost a step. Elsa, Anna, Christoph, Sven, & Olaf are all as entertaining & endearing as ever, their respective actors really breathing life into everyone. The rest of the cast gave noteworthy performances as well.\n\nThe animation wasn't 3D, but it sure felt like it. Everything had a weight & a detail that made me think there were practical models mixed in with the animation. The water & ice animations were especially impressive.\n\nThe music was a mix of old & new, honesty & tongue-in-cheek. I doubt any of the songs'll have the same cultural impact as 'Let It Go' or 'Snow Man', but they were enjoyable.\n\nFrozen 2, to me, felt like a film about growing up, facing obstacles, & coming to terms with a past that may be less rosy than you remember. The action, comedy, suspense, & heart of this film outshine any minor flaw. It definitely stands proudly alongside the first film. 4 outta 5 stars. Winter has come, & it is awesome.","displayName":"Joseph D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001753518237/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T21:55:04.858Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T21:55:10.583Z","user":{"userId":"935746037","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph D","accountLink":"/user/id/935746037"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The whole movie was awesome.","displayName":"Pam M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T21:46:56.757Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T21:46:56.757Z","user":{"userId":"3F5A29C7-55C8-4A7D-8543-5FC5B9A2671C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Pam M","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I Love It.
