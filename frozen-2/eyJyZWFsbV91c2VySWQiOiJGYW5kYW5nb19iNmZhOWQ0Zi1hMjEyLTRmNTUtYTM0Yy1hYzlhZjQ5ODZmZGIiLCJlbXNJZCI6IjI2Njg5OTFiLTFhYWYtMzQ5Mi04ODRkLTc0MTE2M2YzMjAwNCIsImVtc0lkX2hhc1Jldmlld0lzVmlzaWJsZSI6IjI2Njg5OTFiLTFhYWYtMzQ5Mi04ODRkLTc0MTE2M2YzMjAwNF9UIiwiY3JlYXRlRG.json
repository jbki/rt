Too much forgettable singing. Oddly trying to be spiritual on some level, which seems out of place in this type of movie and will go over the heads of most kids. Almost seems like a bunch of different ideas that could have been interesting on their own but instead were thrown together and made to fit. Nowhere near the same quality as the the first one.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T15:23:07.773Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T15:23:07.773Z","user":{"userId":"949179250","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/949179250"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A great movie!!!
