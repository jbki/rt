They should have just wrote him out or make him injured or something instead of have him as ffiller.  The music not as enjoyable as the first.   The musical scenes ha e a weird 80s music video production but dont know if that was deliberate to be funny or accidental..  I think it was worth seeing but falls short of expectations.","displayName":"Miles","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T14:35:29.845Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T14:35:29.845Z","user":{"userId":"6a990288-12c7-4a5b-bbe0-b86ac2273a0c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Miles","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Kids loved the movie, I enjoyed the first one better","displayName":"Google","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T14:35:13.624Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T14:35:13.624Z","user":{"userId":"fa134bd8-6aaf-4be4-abc5-837fa2e1608f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Google","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Singing was greathowever, compared to the first movie none of the songs were memorable.
