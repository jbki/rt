We are huge Disney fans but the story line was weak. Disappointed that we didn’t get the Tarzan tie in. It was more of a musical (with not very catchy tunes).

Very good art. HOWEVER- the plot was short and a lot of moments led to dead ends which cut into what could have been very interesting character development. A particular moment with Kristoff that the movie had teased throughout the entire thing led to a very boring and anticlimactic conclusion. The songs weren’t very catchy at all. I felt like Disney was just trying to produce something like Let It Go, but they forgot to include a factor of what makes a catchy song- the simplicity to sing for the general public. Sorry Disney, this wasn’t it. They also included characters that were awesome! BUT THEY WERE POINTLESS. I would’ve liked to see something funnier, too. There was just too much drama. Also- is anyone else completely pissed that Elsa continues to be a conceited brat? Just me?","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-11-30T02:26:13.869Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T03:18:19.899Z","user":{"userId":"260338566","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260338566"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"SOOOOOOO good! lots of sweet themes and great story telling","displayName":"Melissa","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T02:25:55.108Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T02:25:56.133Z","user":{"userId":"db06f6f0-48be-4250-96c1-bedd77fec7ab","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Melissa","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"We were hoping for a better plot twist.(maybe Ana also had some magic powers).","displayName":"Apryl/Kamila H.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T02:22:38.980Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T02:22:38.980Z","user":{"userId":"DD8C455B-3CB8-4B00-93AC-43EA54A1D611","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Apryl/Kamila H.","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"}]}
