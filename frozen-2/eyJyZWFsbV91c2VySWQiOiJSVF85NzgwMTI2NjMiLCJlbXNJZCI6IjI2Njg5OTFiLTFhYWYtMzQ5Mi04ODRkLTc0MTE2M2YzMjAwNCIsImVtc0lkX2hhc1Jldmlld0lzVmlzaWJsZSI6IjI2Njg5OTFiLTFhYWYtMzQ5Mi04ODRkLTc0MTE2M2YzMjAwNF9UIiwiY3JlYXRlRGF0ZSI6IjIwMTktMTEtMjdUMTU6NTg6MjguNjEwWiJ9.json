Yes, it doesn't feel like it was rebuilt from the same skeleton as its predecessor, which is what a lot of major movie franchises do, making revisits to a theme rather than continuations to a story, with new explorations. IMO, modeling #2 too closely after #1 would never work, it wouldn't be the same and would have ruined the mood for rewatching #1. by having a different direction and overall theme, it leaves frozen 1 as what most ppl want it to be left as: a timeless classic. u don't have to like it as much as or the same way as 1 - what's important is that it doesn't ruin the significance of its pilot by being a shallow thematic revisit. I wish I was a tween when I watched frozen and a young fellow just out of high school when I watched frozen 2. it would have felt perfectly right. same goes for the change in the music style. it's what I imagine my music taste growing from 13-19yo would be. I never thought I'd see the day weezer appears in a Disney movie soundtrack. I think 19 is a good age for getting curious about your dad's old records. with a lineup like weezer and panic at the disco, it doesn't look like this is going to be the usual album full of dubstep-flavoured-pop. again, a wise move. being that the songwriting team are the same ppl(or so I heard) this is like what a successful sophomore album would sound like. not a sad attempt at recreating  breakthrough hits(which rarely works) but an exploration of a more complex and nuanced style and different genres, with songs that are growers needing multiple listens in order to appreciate it better.","displayName":"Jk A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002141616556/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T15:54:56.186Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T15:55:05.472Z","user":{"userId":"955762670","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jk A","accountLink":"/user/id/955762670"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Great music plot was ok.","displayName":"Google","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-27T15:54:02.779Z","updateDate":"2019-11-27T15:54:02.779Z","user":{"userId":"6bca4fe2-feb2-419c-87a6-51f36e5bc114","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Google","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I didnt get to finish the movie since my kids started getting restless, but the first half was amazing!
