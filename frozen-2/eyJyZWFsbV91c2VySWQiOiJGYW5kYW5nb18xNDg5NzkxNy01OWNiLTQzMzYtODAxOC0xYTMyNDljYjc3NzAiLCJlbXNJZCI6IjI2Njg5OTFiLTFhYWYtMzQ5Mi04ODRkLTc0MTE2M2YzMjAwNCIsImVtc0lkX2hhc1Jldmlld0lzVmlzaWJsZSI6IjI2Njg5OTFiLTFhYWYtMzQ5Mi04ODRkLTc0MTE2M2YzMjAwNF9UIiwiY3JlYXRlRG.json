The songs met expectations, the characters each got a moment to shine and the movie even poked fun at itself at times. If you're a true Disney die-hard then you'll have fun finding the little Easter eggs too. Just don't go during opening weekend if you're an adult because the only thing that ruined the experience were the insane amount of kids in the theater. Other than that, Disney has done it again!","displayName":"Bre'Aunna S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T02:02:27.305Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T02:02:27.305Z","user":{"userId":"239BCF0C-E9D5-4BAB-9403-F9EE8CF5327F","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bre'Aunna S","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"loved it..so well written..","displayName":"Sumit","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T02:02:16.318Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T02:02:16.318Z","user":{"userId":"71A48288-E154-483A-9665-70DC95609B6B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sumit","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"There were so many positive life messages throughout the movie.

Disney’s animations is only getting better and better! That’s where the good news ends. Horrible story for kids, nothing close to the first movie. Both my children were very bored with this movie.
