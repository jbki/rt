I didn't hate it and that's rare to say with today's movies. The songs weren't as good as the first. The animation was amazing. Overarching political themes were mostly and thankfully left out. Did this movie make sense to exist? No, but it exists to make cents.","displayName":"Lee B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/500454461/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-17T20:40:33.268Z","updateDate":"2019-12-17T20:40:41.269Z","user":{"userId":"948885504","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lee B","accountLink":"/user/id/948885504"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I loved Kristoff and Anna's proposal and all the sweet misunderstandings that lead up to it.
