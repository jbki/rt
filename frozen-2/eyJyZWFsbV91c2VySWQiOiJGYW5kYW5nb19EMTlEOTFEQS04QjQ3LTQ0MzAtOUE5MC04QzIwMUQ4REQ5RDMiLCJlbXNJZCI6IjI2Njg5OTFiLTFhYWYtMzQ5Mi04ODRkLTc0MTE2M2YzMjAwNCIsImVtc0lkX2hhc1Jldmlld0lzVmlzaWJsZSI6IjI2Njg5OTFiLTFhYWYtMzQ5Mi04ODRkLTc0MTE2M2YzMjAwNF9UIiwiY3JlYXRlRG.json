I felt like the first movie highlighted a lot of Anna’s emotions and this movie did a great job at making Elsa the center focus. Elsa still gives us a great emotional number and the visuals itself honestly make it worth watching anyways. Overall, if your on the fence you should go and see it.","displayName":"Rhian","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T04:19:22.627Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T04:19:22.627Z","user":{"userId":"7D92FEB0-1080-4719-97A6-D9E0AA589201","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rhian","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"We loved it!!!
