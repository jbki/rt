I did enjoy, as an adult, the human however, I’m glad I’m not a parent who has to explain that humor to a child.

Kept my interest. It was funny and sort of deep. My 5 year old niece asked what certain words meant and my 2 year old nephews attention was kept most of the movie except a few parts here and there. More music than the original Frozen. Beautiful graphics and scenes. Had more magical meanings which sort of took away from the characters.","displayName":"Nicole","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T17:01:41.237Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T17:01:41.237Z","user":{"userId":"3BE08E04-57A7-4BA1-A7D0-2578F0611F7E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Nicole","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"}]}
