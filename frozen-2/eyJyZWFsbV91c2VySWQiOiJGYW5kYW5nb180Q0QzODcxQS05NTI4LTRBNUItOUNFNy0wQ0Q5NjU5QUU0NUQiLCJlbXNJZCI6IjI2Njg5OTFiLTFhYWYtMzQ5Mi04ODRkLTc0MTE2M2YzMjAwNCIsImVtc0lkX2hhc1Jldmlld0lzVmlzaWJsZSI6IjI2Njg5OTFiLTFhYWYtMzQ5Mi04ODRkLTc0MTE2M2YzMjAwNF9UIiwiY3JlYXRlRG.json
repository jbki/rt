No matter your age or what you're going through in life, this movie will have something that resonates with you, and Disney delivered another masterpiece that makes you laugh, warms your heart, and gives you characters you can't help but fall in love with. The story is gripping and ties in perfectly with the first movie while answering the all-important question of why Elsa has her powers, and the two movies feel like one big story. Left the theater wanting to see it again, and I definitely will.","displayName":"James P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-03T00:59:17.914Z","updateDate":"2019-12-03T00:59:17.914Z","user":{"userId":"977028426","realm":"RT","displayName":"James P","accountLink":"/user/id/977028426"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it, the graphics, the adventure, the new characters.
