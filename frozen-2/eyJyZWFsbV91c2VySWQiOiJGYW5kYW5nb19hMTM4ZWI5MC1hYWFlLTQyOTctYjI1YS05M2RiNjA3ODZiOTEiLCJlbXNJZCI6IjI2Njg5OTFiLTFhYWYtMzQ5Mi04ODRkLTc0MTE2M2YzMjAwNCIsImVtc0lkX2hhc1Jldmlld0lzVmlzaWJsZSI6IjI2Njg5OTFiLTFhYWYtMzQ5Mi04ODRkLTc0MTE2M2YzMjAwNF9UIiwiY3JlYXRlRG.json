Yes Elsa has powers and she learned to use them for the good. but by who did she learn that from.

Most of the story worked, still have some unanswered plot holes that we thought were a little glaring.  Still I think any Frozen fan will be happy.  Wonder if they will try for a third?  Wasn't wrapped up tightly so could happen down the road.
