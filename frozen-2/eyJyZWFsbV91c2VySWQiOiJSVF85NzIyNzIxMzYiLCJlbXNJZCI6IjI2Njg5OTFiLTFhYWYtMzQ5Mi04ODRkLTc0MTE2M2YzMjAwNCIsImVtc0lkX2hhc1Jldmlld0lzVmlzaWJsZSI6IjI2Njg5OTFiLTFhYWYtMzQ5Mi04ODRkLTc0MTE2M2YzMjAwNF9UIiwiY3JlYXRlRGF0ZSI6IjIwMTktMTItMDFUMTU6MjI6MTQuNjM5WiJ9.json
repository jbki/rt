Not my favorite kids movie, but enjoyed it as an adult. This was my 3yos first movie at the theaters and I was disappointed at how infrequently she laughed!! Not anything like the first movie, in my opinion. More deep moments, real-life moments that I think are better geared toward teens and adults than the young crowd. \n\nAlso, the Kristoff song, while hilarious, I felt did not fit AT. ALL! Could have used a more authentic way of Kristoff opening up than an 80s/90s tribute-style song. A weird addition, I thought.","displayName":"Great music and life lessons, meh for kids.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T14:42:21.979Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T14:42:21.979Z","user":{"userId":"826ecaea-77ce-4a0e-b22e-586f43fed1d8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Great music and life lessons, meh for kids.","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Creators have yet another beautiful animation script woven around an intricate storyline, that captures various emotions&mood as well as keeping audience enchanted with wonderful graphics...
