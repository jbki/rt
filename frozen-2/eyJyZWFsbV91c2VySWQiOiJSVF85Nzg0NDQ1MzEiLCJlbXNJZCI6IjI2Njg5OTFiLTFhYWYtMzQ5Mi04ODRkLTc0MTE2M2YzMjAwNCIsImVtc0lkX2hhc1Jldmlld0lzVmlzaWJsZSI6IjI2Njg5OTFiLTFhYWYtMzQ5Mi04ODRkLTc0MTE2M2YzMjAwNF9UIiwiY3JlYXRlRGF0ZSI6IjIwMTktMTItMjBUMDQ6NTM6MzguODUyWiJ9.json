Yes it's music may not be as earwormy as the first soundtrack but it's music is used so cleverly and impactfully. Olaf is as funny as ever with not one joke failing and even has a somewhat catchy song. The movie started off warmly but you could feel the metaphorical storm brewing which was a nice touch. Kristoff is as worthless as ever though, only being likable in his solo \"Lost In The Woods\" which I even thought was a little too corny. Anna is the most important as ever though, she impacts the story in very unique and big ways. She had to make tough decisions even if it was risky or seemed wrong. She truly feels like a peer to Elsa now and not the powerless sister. Yes there are some shortcomings for sure, I think we just didn't see enough character development with the new human characters. Brunei though, he may be the best new addition to a sequel like ever, not gonna lie. He's cute, powerful, and funny. Overall this movie is a whole lot of fun, it isn't perfect but it's the most eye catching animated movie I've ever seen and has a meaningful depth filled plot.","displayName":"Jerry R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T04:49:04.433Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T04:49:06.109Z","user":{"userId":"974713539","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jerry R","accountLink":"/user/id/974713539"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Thought it was a more mature Disney movie, very good and entertaining but left me wondering if the kids in the cinema really understood the slightly complex storyline","displayName":"Ruth M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1770942229709774/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T04:34:17.322Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T04:34:24.016Z","user":{"userId":"978444389","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ruth M","accountLink":"/user/id/978444389"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Not as good as the first one but sequels are never better than the original","displayName":"Astrid R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T04:31:56.557Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T04:31:56.557Z","user":{"userId":"173ff1d1-8a8a-41de-9681-7bf744193c6c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Astrid R","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Great movie with lots of great scenes, but the songs did not match the level of greatness that the first movie had.

I was not a fan of the first Frozen movie and clearly am not the targeted audience so maybe that is why I disliked it. The story wasn't as captivating as the original and some parts made me cringe so much. The musical aspect of the movie also lacked and clearly they tried to repeat the explosive success of Let it Go with these songs but it just fell flat. Olaf however was the saving grace for this movie as the character's extended screen time and development brought a smile to my face. Frozen is worth taking your child to see but prepare for a less than satisfying experience at the cinema","displayName":"Lachlan S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T03:36:12.668Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T03:37:27.429Z","user":{"userId":"978443570","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lachlan S","accountLink":"/user/id/978443570"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"}]}
