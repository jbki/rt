After I loved Frozen, this movie didn't give me a reason to hope for an outcome. I really was just waiting for Anna to confirm with Elsa that we did it, because the movie doesn't give you the climactic moment where you know the protagonists fought hard and achieved an outcome! It was funny but I'd rather watch Ice Age 3 or 4 for some jokes.","displayName":"Nick G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/192224215279016/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T20:41:26.002Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T20:41:33.954Z","user":{"userId":"978404468","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nick G","accountLink":"/user/id/978404468"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"very good sequel, give it a watch","displayName":"David","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T20:39:43.834Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T20:39:43.834Z","user":{"userId":"459ABDB3-9646-44EF-AFD6-F896D1770ED9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"David","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"it was great my child was sitting comfy and didn't have a fuss it was overall a great experience","displayName":"frozen 2","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T20:38:09.325Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T20:38:09.325Z","user":{"userId":"B15645F4-C9C2-4A50-B1D0-2AA0EBE579FD","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"frozen 2","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Great for kids who are a bit older (6 +).
