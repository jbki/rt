My three grandchildren and I were on our edge of seats with the many adventure scenes. Elsa and Anna were so beautiful as the young girls they were in the movie and the grown ladies they became. It was touching to see their mother holding and hugging them when they were small and seeing the connection their mother had with the story.","displayName":"Janette","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T03:38:34.853Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T03:38:35.471Z","user":{"userId":"6a442961-8f40-4d1b-b44f-8ac5cafcdd5c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Janette","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"We loved the songs and all the new characters","displayName":"Jones Family","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T03:37:09.689Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T03:37:09.689Z","user":{"userId":"37027459-669B-47A8-80E3-C37794655C6B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jones Family","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"We took our 3 granddaughters (5, 6 & 9 yrs old) they enjoyed it very much as did I but I would say the story line was not smooth and was bit contrived.
