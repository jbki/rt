And one song she talks about how she does not want to go shes not gonna listen to the spirit then by the end of the song shes begging the spirit to speak to her.

It was even better than the first Frozen which I thought would be impossible. It was a bit heavy hearted but very appropriate in timing of maturity for the young girls who would have fallen in love w the first Frozen if they were 3 or 4 then. My daughter is older and loved that it explained how the parents died and that it allowed both Elsa AND Anna to have powers in their team effort. Just many positive messages for young kids watching!","displayName":"Renee K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T15:17:27.073Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T15:17:27.073Z","user":{"userId":"048ab799-18fb-4f1d-ad2e-970c707fafbf","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Renee K","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fantastic!
