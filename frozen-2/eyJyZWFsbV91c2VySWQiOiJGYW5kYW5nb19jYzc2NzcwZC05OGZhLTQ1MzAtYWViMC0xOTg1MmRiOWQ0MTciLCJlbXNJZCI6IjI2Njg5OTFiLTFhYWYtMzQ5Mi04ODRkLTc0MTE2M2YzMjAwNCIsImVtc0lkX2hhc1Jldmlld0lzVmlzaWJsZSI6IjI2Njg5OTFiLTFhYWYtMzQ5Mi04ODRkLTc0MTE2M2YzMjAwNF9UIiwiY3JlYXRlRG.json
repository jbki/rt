I felt that the songs in this one were more forced than the prior one. Frankly I could have done without Kristofs song in the woods altogether.. and the song that Ana sings when she has to get out of the cave. I did like the theme of saving the environment and doing the right thing. Very appropriate for what we are facing now in our society. Overall Id watch is again becaue.. well its Disney and my kids will want to. Just will have to ignore some of the singing!","displayName":"Veronica N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T02:07:23.205Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T02:07:23.205Z","user":{"userId":"9652421b-b104-4a37-9bbc-aad4338e5762","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Veronica N","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The animation was gorgeous, there was great character development, and catchy songs.","displayName":"Kim Smith","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T01:58:33.478Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T01:58:33.478Z","user":{"userId":"bafcc112-1c96-4362-b547-0ccb96c93891","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kim Smith","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The grandkids enjoyed it very much.
