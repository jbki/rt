There were way too many songs and all forgettable. The first Frozen had great songs that were unforgettable and very likable. Olaf was the most enjoyable, but even his character was written badly. Olaf should have been left as simple and lovable, not as someone searching for deeper meaning and often morose.","displayName":"Elizabeth T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T02:58:02.875Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T02:58:02.875Z","user":{"userId":"bbd67514-1cf5-4bb6-8aa7-58e96edaf834","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Elizabeth T","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Too much unnecessary singing.
