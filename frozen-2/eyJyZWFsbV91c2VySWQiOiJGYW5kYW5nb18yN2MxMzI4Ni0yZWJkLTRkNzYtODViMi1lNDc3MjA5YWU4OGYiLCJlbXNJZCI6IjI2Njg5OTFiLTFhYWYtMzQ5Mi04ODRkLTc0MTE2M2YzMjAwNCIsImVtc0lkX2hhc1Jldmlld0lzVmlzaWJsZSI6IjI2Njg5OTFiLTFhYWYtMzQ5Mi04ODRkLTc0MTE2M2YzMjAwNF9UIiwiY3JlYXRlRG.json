The songs weren't as good as the original, but I liked most of 'em.  The Kristoff solo was completely unnecessary, though.\nAlso, there's a scene after the credits!!!  Stay & watch!

All of the original characters return and some new ones are added, yet I feel as if they're not very necessary and don't really add to the plot. Also, there are too many plots going on which means that it jumps from idea to idea too quickly. Overall, it is a very good movie and an excellent successor. The songs are great and it meets the expectations.","displayName":"Daniyal I","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T16:30:17.873Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T16:30:28.231Z","user":{"userId":"978470452","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniyal I","accountLink":"/user/id/978470452"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great music and story line","displayName":"Brandiismom","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T16:19:10.503Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T16:19:11.562Z","user":{"userId":"cec81c30-d1cf-4a68-8840-d31e8ea5c497","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Brandiismom","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"so much better than the first one","displayName":"mike b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T16:17:00.715Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T16:17:02.954Z","user":{"userId":"961220715","realm":"RT","displayName":"mike b","accountLink":"/user/id/961220715"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Love it and my daughter too !!","displayName":"Augusto","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T15:47:06.794Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T15:47:06.794Z","user":{"userId":"9BC47EB7-2ADD-4EEF-8165-6F881272110A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Augusto","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"it was great to see the beloved characters again. the story was intriguing, but it lacked the spark of the first movie. the Christoph song was bizarre and there was not enough levity to balance the darkness of the storyline.","displayName":"Andrea F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T15:08:12.131Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T15:08:12.131Z","user":{"userId":"C7B57836-F94D-4E0B-BB2A-B29C8E68BA5E","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Andrea F","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"}]}
