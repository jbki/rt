It makes Frozen is so has a story that also fits an adult audience. The visual is so wonderful and make us bewitched. It can rise again magical animation era from Disney that present in the 90's. Frozen is the only best animation that has magical force from Disney in 2010's decade. But Frozen II didn't have a magical soundtrack- like the first movie because the arrangement of the song is not consistent. In one sequence so strict, and in other sequence so loose. I hope if it is a trilogy, it must be develope well because many people love all of this movie. From story, characters, until the song.","displayName":"Zinema M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T12:37:15.271Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T12:37:17.631Z","user":{"userId":"978219173","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zinema M","accountLink":"/user/id/978219173"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The best!

Where the movie really fell flat was the music, which was a large part of the first film's greatness. The songs are not at all memorable and you will find yourself challenged to sing any of them as you leave the theater. I heard many movie-goers actually complaining about the music on the way out of the theater, so it was more than just me that thought this. Immediately following the film I asked my 9 year old niece what she thought and she said \"the music kinda sucked.\" So there's that. Overall, worth the view if you are a Frozen 1 fan. Just don't expect too much and you will be fine. Just a notch up from a straight-to-video film I would say. It's doing well at the box office,  but is riding the coat-tails of Frozen 1, so will be interesting to see of a Frozen 3 makes it to the theaters.","displayName":"Zombiekiller0472","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T12:24:45.748Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T12:24:45.748Z","user":{"userId":"20def541-ed50-4c39-ac9b-75463ceb7898","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Zombiekiller0472","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I liked the 1st movie better.
