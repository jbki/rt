Stories are supposed to be derived from a non fictional world and transformed into a fictional world. And Frozen did just that. They remind us of our true nature, true power and endless possibilities. They are here to show us that when we set our minds to it, we can do pretty much anything. This movie is visually breathtaking and the animation is superb. Olaf was hilarious.
