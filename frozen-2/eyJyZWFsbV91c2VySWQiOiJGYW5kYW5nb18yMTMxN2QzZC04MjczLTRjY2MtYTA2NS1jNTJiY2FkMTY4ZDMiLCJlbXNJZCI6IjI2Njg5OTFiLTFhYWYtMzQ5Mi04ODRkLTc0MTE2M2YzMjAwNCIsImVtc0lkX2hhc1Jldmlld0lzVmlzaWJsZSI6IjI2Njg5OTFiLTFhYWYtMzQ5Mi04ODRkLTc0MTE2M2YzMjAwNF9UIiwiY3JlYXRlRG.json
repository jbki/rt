Frozen II lacked the depth of Frozen.  The score wasn't\n as good, either.  Personally, I can't stand Olaf.  Pretty costume design.  Two things always bother me about Disney: they never let their vocalists fulfill their ranges (songs always stop below a full octave) and animated hair on characters always looks like cotton candy.  At least  unlike Frozen, it didn't have any scatological references (the Troll's song reference to \"tinkling in the forest\").  I don't know why anyone would think that scatology is entertaining, but it isn't and adds nothing to the movie.","displayName":"laurie b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-26T16:08:12.369Z","updateDate":"2019-12-26T16:08:12.369Z","user":{"userId":"85dda1f5-145b-4bad-8d7e-752390eac14e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"laurie b","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"“Samantha!
