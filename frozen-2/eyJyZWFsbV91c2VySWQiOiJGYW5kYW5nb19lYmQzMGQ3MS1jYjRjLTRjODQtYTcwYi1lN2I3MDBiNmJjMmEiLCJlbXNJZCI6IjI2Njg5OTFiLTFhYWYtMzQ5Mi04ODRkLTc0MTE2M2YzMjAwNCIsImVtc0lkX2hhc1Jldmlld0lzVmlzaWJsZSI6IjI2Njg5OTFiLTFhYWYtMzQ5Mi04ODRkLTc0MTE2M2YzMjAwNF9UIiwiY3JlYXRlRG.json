Frozen II is worth seeing for the creative and sumptuous visual artistry, if nothing else. Luckily, there is plenty to enjoy here, from Olafs bizarre and existential character arc, to the intricate lore explored, and the reveal of a brand new group of people whose entire culture has been lost. I dont recommend watching these movies for the music, but I did appreciate the emotional rawness of these songs in their context in the film. Outside of the film, Im dont see myself jamming to these, but I could be proven wrong. Ultimately, if youre asking whether or not this film adds anything necessary, I would argue it does. It answers questions that plagued the first film and further builds a world that is rich, real, and truly exquisite to behold. A glittering edition to the Disney Animation collection, and I just felt satisfied after watching it. Would still watch a third entry if its handled this way.","displayName":"Elena S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T15:15:55.413Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T15:15:55.413Z","user":{"userId":"0dbbff97-d2d4-4c85-807b-7132edea0c5c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Elena S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Spectacular animation, and admirable effort at complex plot.
