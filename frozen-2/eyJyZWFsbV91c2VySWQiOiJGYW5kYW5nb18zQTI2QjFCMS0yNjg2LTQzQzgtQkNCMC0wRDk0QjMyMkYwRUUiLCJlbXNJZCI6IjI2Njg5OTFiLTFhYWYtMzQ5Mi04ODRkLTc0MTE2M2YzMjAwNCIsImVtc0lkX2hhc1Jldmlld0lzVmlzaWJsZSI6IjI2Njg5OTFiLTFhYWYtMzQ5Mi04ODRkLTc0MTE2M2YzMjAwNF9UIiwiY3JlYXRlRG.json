Some of the scenes are stunning to watch.  Characters grow and develop, building on the first film rather than going in a completely different direction, and message is a wonderful one both in terms of Elsa's and Anna's stories.  And, if you are a 80s child who danced at prom to some type of classic rock love song (i.e. I Can't Fight This Feeling by REO Speedwagon), there is one musical throwback number that will make you laugh and is perfectly done while turning the traditional Snow White sings in the forest with her bird friends on its head.  An entertaining film for adults and kids that has deeper ideas underneath.","displayName":"SAM","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T21:49:30.342Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T21:49:30.342Z","user":{"userId":"b400eb5c-ebbc-4bc3-ae1d-edf71f7c65cd","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"SAM","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"my favorite movie ever","displayName":"turqeyes51 S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T21:48:39.728Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T21:48:39.728Z","user":{"userId":"CD2F753B-2843-4ABC-87A8-8B17D7A8EDEA","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"turqeyes51 S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie which definitely did not disappoint!","displayName":"J.D.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T21:47:40.810Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T21:47:40.810Z","user":{"userId":"691BC3A0-C8EE-4FF2-AD81-418B48425558","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"J.D.","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Another animated classic!
