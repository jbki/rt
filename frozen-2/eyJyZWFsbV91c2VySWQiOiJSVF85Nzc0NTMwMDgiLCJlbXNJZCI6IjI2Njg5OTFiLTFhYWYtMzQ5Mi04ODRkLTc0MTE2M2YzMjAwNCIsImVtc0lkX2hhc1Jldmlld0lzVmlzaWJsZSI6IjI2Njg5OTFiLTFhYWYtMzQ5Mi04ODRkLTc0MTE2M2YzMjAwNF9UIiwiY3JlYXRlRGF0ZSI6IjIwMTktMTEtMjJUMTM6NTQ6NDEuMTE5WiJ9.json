The best moment of the movie is Olaf the snowman's plot summary of the previous film.  Classic.  However that is all the positive things I can say about this movie.  It is not terrible by any means.  Fans of the first movie will not be disappointed.  However I feel the movie falls flat almost immediately.  The songs are good but mostly forgettable.  Also the story felt a bit contrived.  It seemed to me like the writers were desperate for a sequel that they did not think the story out very much.  I was certainly not bored by \"Frozen 2\" by any means, but I found myself not liking it as much as I thought I would.","displayName":"Michael C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T13:10:25.075Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T13:10:29.645Z","user":{"userId":"901197331","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael C","accountLink":"/user/id/901197331"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"yahh itz really good for a 9-year-old kid like me","displayName":"Khoa T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/528088967777515/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-22T13:09:22.762Z","updateDate":"2019-11-22T13:09:29.327Z","user":{"userId":"978400496","realm":"RT","displayName":"Khoa T","accountLink":"/user/id/978400496"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"One of the many things that mad the first movie a success was that the audience could relate to all the characters and the songs.
