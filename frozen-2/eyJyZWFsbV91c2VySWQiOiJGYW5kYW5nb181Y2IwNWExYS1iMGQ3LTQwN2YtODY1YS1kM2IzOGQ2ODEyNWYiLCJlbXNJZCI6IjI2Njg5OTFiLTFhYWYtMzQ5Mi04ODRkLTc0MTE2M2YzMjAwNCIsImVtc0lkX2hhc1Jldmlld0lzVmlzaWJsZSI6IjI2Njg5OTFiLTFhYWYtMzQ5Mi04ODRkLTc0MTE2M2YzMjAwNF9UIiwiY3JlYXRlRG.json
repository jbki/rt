In some ways better than the first one. Don't agree at all with some of the major criticisms I've heard. I actually enjoyed Olaf (didn't in the first one)! He was much funnier here, and his character also serves an important thematic purpose. Was nearly in tears at his character's climax. Anna's decision at the end (no spoilers) made sense to me. She was truly heroic, and I love the way this move reinforced the need these two sisters have of each other. Their bond, once again, makes the movie. It's more epic than the first, it doesn't need a typical villain, the world building is fantastic, and it ends in a satisfying way. The only lingering questions I have are in regards to Elsa's big reveal (no spoilers). Some things still don't make sense, and I felt they could've addressed that a little more. Also, the songs were just too much at times. In particular, I wish Elsa's reveal (major plot point!) was not done through a cheesy song. At least the song should've paused, it would've landed better. It felt like they were trying too hard. For that, I dock it one half-star.
