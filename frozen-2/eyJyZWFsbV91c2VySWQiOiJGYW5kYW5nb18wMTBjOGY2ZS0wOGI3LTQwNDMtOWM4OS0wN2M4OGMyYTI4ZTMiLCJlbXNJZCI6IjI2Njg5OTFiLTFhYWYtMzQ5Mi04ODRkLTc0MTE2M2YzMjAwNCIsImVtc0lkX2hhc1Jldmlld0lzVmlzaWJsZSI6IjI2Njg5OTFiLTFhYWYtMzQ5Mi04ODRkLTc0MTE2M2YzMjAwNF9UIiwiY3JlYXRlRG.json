Parents, brace yourselves), some terrific animated sequences--watch out for a scene involving Elsa and a horse--and retains much of the first one's charm and sisterhood qualities to just about make up for its very thin storytelling.","displayName":"Shaurya C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1667993893/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T07:46:44.512Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T07:46:48.344Z","user":{"userId":"852999764","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shaurya C","accountLink":"/user/id/852999764"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very good - even for parents!!

There was way to much singing. Kristoff proposed to Anna but there was no wedding!! How could they leave that out?! That could have been a nice way to end. And why not address Elsa's love life or not; introduce a new characters with the same powers as her she falls in love with or something. For how long they were working on this, they could have done SO much better. The chameleon should have been introduced in the beginning instead of halfway towards the end since it was so cute and Elsas companion. The best part of the movie was Olaf's joke! I hope they make a Frozen 3 and introduce a boyfriend or girlfriend for Elsa and a wedding for Kristoff. And than Anna has a baby. Something should happen to one of the main characters, even Olaf they have to rescue and there should be a villain. It could even be the big snowman kidnapping Olaf or something. And Elsa should make Olaf and girlfriend and call her Samantha!  . I hope someone important reads this and agrees...","displayName":"Unmbar H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1061365286/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T07:33:47.104Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T07:45:33.806Z","user":{"userId":"907118645","realm":"RT","displayName":"Unmbar H","accountLink":"/user/id/907118645"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Great movie just as good as the first.","displayName":"Yulma R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-23T07:33:01.877Z","updateDate":"2019-11-23T07:33:01.877Z","user":{"userId":"309F6C0B-6E49-460D-8B28-DAFF4C527856","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Yulma R","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Gorgeous animation and catchy songs, but a convoluted story prevents it from reaching the heights of the first.
