An engaging enough storyline that was easy to see what was coming (for adults) throughout the movie. The character Olaf and some of his ramblings saved the day for the movie but, overall, this was just ok for me and my family. Kids will love it because of their engagement with Olaf and other characters.","displayName":"Shane R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T06:33:26.983Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T06:33:30.752Z","user":{"userId":"955151171","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shane R","accountLink":"/user/id/955151171"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Plot didn't make sense.
