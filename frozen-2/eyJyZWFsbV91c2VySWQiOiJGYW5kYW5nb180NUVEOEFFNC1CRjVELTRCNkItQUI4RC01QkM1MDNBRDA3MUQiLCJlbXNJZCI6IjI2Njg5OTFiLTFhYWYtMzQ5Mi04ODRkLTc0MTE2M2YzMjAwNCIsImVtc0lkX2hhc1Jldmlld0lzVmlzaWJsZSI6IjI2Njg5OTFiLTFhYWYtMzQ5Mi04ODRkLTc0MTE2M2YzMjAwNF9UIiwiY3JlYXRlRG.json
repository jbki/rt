Great character development all around, great story, exciting plot. The new characters are a bit lackluster, but as they only serve to move the story along or act as comedic pieces, there was never really a need to develop them more. Would definitely recommend","displayName":"Derek O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T01:13:31.423Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T01:13:31.423Z","user":{"userId":"978404764","realm":"RT","displayName":"Derek O","accountLink":"/user/id/978404764"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Won't ruin it for anyone so will just say that it was the perfect movie to watch during holidays.

In this sequel we finally saw more about Elsa's powers and cement the idea that extraordinary should never lead an ordinary life. The music is fabulous and there are no words to describe the animation of this film expect an absolute masterpiece. And yes at the end the risk taken was pretty minor but whats the point of a fantasy movie for children if we cant get all happy endings??","displayName":"Regina D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/809115421/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T01:12:49.917Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T01:12:54.595Z","user":{"userId":"822797408","realm":"RT","displayName":"Regina D","accountLink":"/user/id/822797408"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Very disappointing.
