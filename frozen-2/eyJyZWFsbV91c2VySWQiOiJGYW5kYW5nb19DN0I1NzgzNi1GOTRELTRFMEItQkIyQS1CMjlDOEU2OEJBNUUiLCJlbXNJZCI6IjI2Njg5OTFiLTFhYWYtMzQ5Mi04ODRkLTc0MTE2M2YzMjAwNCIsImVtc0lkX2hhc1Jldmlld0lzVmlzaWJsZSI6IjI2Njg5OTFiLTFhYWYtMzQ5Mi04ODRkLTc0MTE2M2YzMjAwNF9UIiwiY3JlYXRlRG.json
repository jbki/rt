The number of franchises that can pull in over $1 billion per film is monumental. Franchise recognition obviously plays a huge role in this, but I feel that a quality film is the difference between a good box office showing and a billion-dollar box office showing. Frozen II does not match the heights of the original, but it's a darn good movie all the same.\n\nThe film takes great pains to let the audience know that everyone is doing just great at the start of our story. Elsa rules and is beloved by her people, Anna and Kristoff are happy together, and Olaf is fitting in with the town. Only when an outside force calls to Elsa does the conflict begin. It's somewhat reminiscent of Pocahontas, with an established set a characters meeting a group from a different world. \n\nOnce again, Anna and Elsa are centre stage here, though Elsa does get to do more worldbuilding and exploration of her powers. The other relationships are there, but it is immediately clear who is driving the plot. As a result, all the side characters are just not as colourful as they were in the first film. They're there, and the characterizations are consistent, but this installment feels more like The Royal Sisters (And Their Orchestra).\n\nThere is some fun music here. It's almost operatic, with its sweeping grandeur and powerful vocals. I daresay this music will be almost as relevant as \"Let it Go\" was six years ago.\n\nIt's a fun story with a twisty ending that focuses on the sisterly bond of the two leads, if not as groundbreaking as the original.","displayName":"James S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/659620132/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T14:21:59.443Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T14:21:59.443Z","user":{"userId":"903748135","realm":"RT","displayName":"James S","accountLink":"/user/id/903748135"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"i got very emotional and im 26","displayName":"Natalie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T14:12:51.793Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T14:12:51.793Z","user":{"userId":"ad7c484e-c3c2-4c3f-a393-989839835c86","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Natalie","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"I did like the music and the songs Elsa sings. though the story itself feels like it's a direct to video Disney sequel.","displayName":"Manuel","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T13:06:30.404Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T13:06:30.404Z","user":{"userId":"13ABCD6D-3D09-406C-95ED-CD3D2BD300B6","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Manuel","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Funny, entertaining....the story line was a little lost but was pulled together in the end..","displayName":"Jennifer O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T12:05:07.671Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T12:05:07.671Z","user":{"userId":"755f240b-6edb-418d-8354-52ee0455d4df","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jennifer O","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I enjoyed watching my grandchildren so into the movie.
