Music was not as AMAZING, not as catchy. This surprises me, as I feel that the first movie balanced the characters, music, and the story really well. This was a revisit with great characters, a good shot at character development of the lost parents who birthed these amazing kids, but the story was not elevated and driven by the music this time, still fun though!","displayName":"Niki","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T11:33:44.798Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T11:33:44.798Z","user":{"userId":"e85df996-6879-4b13-8dcc-86e0af2f73a4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Niki","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It was very dramatic and predictable","displayName":"Diane","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T11:32:17.475Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T11:32:17.475Z","user":{"userId":"61375eee-716c-4ed7-8144-953eff23b277","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Diane","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The animation was stunning!!!!!!\nThe music was great-just not as catchy or memorable as the first. \nI loved all of Anna and Elsas outfits.\nSome of the plot lines felt rushed and left me with a few unanswered questions.\nTotally worth fighting the crowds to go see it in theaters!","displayName":"Kim","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T11:30:03.656Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T11:30:03.656Z","user":{"userId":"5b84a5f8-bd57-4f85-8662-907155290d77","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kim","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I liked it Better than the original","displayName":"Natalie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T11:27:07.879Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T11:27:07.879Z","user":{"userId":"BBE6D25B-D6C2-4404-85FB-78FA77A87BD9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Natalie","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My daughter and I loved the fact that this movie showed both of the sisters strengths and allowed them to be who they really are. In the first Frozen movie you could tell Elsa was struggling to fit in Arendelle, and Anna was the level head mostly. But Frozen II allowed them to show that they were born to parents of separate nations and 1 of them needed to be with the other side. This was a great way to show how different but yet a like in theor hearts they were. Great job with this one. And the new songs were perfect! We downloaded the soundtrack prior to going to see the movie.","displayName":"Prolific85","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-25T11:24:05.402Z","updateDate":"2019-11-25T11:30:07.353Z","user":{"userId":"b5c93f82-9304-41fb-9c61-a1f237add438","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Prolific85","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was a lot  better than the first one.
