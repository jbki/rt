Have to see it on the big screen. Good story to explain things. And not to make it another mushy princess movie. Finally two bad ass princesses. Plus some day too many songs. Well news flash. It’s a musical. And original was slatted as a musical as well. Agree on not memorable songs as original. But overall. A great movie. Don’t listen to the one or two star losers. They don’t k or a good movie when they see it.

But, it shouldn't be docked points for that. It was a great story with a different direction from its predecessor. The music doesn't have the charm and giddy feeling like the first, it's more raw given the circumstances the characters are in. I don't know why critics are claiming that it's lower in quality because of its different, more meaningful direction that it takes. It was a great movie. It had sad moments, It had happy moments. It answered questions left behind from the first movie. You walk out satisfied. It shouldn't be given under a 4.5/5 tbh.","displayName":"Drew S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/340356606353794/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T17:40:15.073Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T17:40:26.536Z","user":{"userId":"959497127","realm":"RT","displayName":"Drew S","accountLink":"/user/id/959497127"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Movie was awesome, part 1 was very funny and this one was very emotional but in a good way very good movie ❤","displayName":"sfavela1","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-28T17:36:55.266Z","updateDate":"2019-11-28T17:36:55.266Z","user":{"userId":"788D6302-84BC-4A1B-9598-B8B59410199D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"sfavela1","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Definitely was great sequel!!!
