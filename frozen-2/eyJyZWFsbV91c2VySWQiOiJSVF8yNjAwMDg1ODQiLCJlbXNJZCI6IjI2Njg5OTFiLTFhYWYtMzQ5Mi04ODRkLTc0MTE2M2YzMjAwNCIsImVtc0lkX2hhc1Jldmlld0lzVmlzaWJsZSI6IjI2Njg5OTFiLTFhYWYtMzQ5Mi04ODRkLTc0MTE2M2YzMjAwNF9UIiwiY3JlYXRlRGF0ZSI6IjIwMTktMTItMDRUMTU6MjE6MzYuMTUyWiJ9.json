The story was extremely convoluted and had all kinds of mixed messages - all good ones - but it was a mishmash of themes.  The original was a great story because it was classically structured, with a very clear focus.  i'm surprised people liked the music so much.  I thought it lacked the very memorable songs of the first.  All this being said, my 11 year old son loved it, but he \"loves\" everything.","displayName":"James W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T14:52:21.701Z","updateDate":"2019-12-06T17:06:15.344Z","user":{"userId":"900eef70-b241-48a9-8fc7-07ba9734c6da","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"James W","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"A good watch, catchy new songs, did not capture me as much as the first movie as originals are always best.
