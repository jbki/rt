I took 3 little girls to see it. They loved it, but for me it lacks the breadth of quirky incidental characters (beyond those we already know) that the first had and also comes up short of songs. Clearly the budget was vastly higher this time with no sign of the cheaply done animation that was used in the first in scenes such as when Hans fell over after meeting Anna for instance, but Disney excels at showtunes and characters, both of which lacked here.","displayName":"Ken L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10218931091082380/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T03:38:54.781Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T03:38:59.618Z","user":{"userId":"978406302","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ken L","accountLink":"/user/id/978406302"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Cute movie with an entertaining story line","displayName":"reviewer","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T03:35:34.223Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T03:35:34.223Z","user":{"userId":"D0F60F1D-B555-4CE7-81FA-84DBF4CD5383","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"reviewer","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"to dark. complicated story line.","displayName":"Lina","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T03:35:23.006Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T03:35:23.006Z","user":{"userId":"6A5FF7B7-28BC-4D1F-B6D2-A3D7C30444EE","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Lina","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Great for the kids kinda meh for adults unlike the first one!!","displayName":"Norah L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-26T03:35:22.760Z","updateDate":"2019-11-26T03:35:22.760Z","user":{"userId":"0ED4ED87-578E-4AA0-AC0C-F9237ACAE500","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Norah L","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Ugh.
