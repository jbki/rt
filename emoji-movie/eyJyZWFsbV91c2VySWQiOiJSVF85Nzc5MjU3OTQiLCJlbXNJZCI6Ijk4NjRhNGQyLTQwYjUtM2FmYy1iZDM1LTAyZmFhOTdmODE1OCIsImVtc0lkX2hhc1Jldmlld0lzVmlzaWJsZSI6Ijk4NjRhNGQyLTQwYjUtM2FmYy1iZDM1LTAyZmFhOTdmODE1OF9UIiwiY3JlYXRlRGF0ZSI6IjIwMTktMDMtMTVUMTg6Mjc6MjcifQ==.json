Patrick Stewart as a poop emoji? An inspired decision by director Tony Leondis. Going into this movie, I couldn't have imagine that he would improve on his previous effort \"Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch\", but this movie was phenomenal! I have seen this movie thrice and it never gets old. I admire Gene breaking the social norms of the emoji society and discovering himself. Obviously this is a critique of beauty standards and the stifling atmosphere created by our hyper obsessed social media culture. I admire Tony Leondis' effort in highlighting this point via emojis and his creative team knocked all of our socks off! I am so impressed and will recommend this to friends, my mother, my father, my professors (RTF profs), my neighbors, and last but not least my pastor!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/787133314632557/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-02-26T17:37:07.000Z","updateDate":"2019-02-26T18:01:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977853412","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977853412"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I literally want to die after seeing this movie please kill me it's fucking terrible.\nWhen the movie starts it's kinda meh it's bad but not extreme cringe.
