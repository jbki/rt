The main character is a freshman, a movie point never used before with a story arch so creative I was in awe. I love this movie and all of the hilarious puns about poop and hands.

If you want good kids movies, watch or re-watch the movies this directly copies: The Lego Movie and Wreck-It-Ralph. They showcase fitting in without making it about just being popular, integrate commercial properties in a sane way without just flooding you with mid-movie advertizing. In Wreck-It-Ralph, it was cute to see recognizable properties, whereas The Emoji Movie either floods the screen with logos or jams in a section dedicated to a single app. Where The Lego Movie shows kids that they can be unique and creative, and don't have to conform, This movie tries telling you it's about \"real friends\" while actively making everyone automatically worship Gene, and Gene's unique personality doesn't encourage the other characters to express themselves differently, but instead shows that Gene is a special case. It's family friendly image is nothing more than a thin cloak over the lifeless feature length advertisement. I don't think the actual viewership will make any impact on the success of this film, because they probably made back the whole of their 50 mil budget and then some before a single soul bought a ticket or merchandise, that's how overwhelming the amount of product placement is..","displayName":"Eddy C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000797371131/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T21:11:11.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T21:25:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"957447126","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eddy C","accountLink":"/user/id/957447126"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????","displayName":"Silvio E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T21:09:40.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T21:11:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"976580527","realm":"RT","displayName":"Silvio E","accountLink":"/user/id/976580527"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Absolutely terrible! ??","displayName":"Luke W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T21:07:08.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T21:07:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"976580518","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luke W","accountLink":"/user/id/976580518"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The message the movie was trying to send was obvious from the very beginning, however, it's a kid's movie. This movie isnt for those that arent fans of the obvious. It IS for those who love bad puns, though. The movie tackles topics poorly as there is typically no development of said topics. For example an issue between two characters was fixed in the very next scene. Overall, I personally enjoyed the movie.","displayName":"O G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T21:05:37.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T21:13:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"976580511","realm":"RT","displayName":"O G","accountLink":"/user/id/976580511"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Made me laugh, made me cry!","displayName":"s b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T21:02:01.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T21:02:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"922517499","realm":"RT","displayName":"s b","accountLink":"/user/id/922517499"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"best movie in eternity.","displayName":"Logan Q","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T21:01:56.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T21:01:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"976580497","realm":"RT","displayName":"Logan Q","accountLink":"/user/id/976580497"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"So far, TWO critics rated this garbage \"fresh.\" Let that sink in for a bit...","displayName":"Mark C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T21:00:43.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T21:01:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"976580493","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark C","accountLink":"/user/id/976580493"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is probably one of the best films I have ever seen.
