Even though the animation is OK, the plot is confusing, the writing is really over the top, the characters are lame, the comedy is awful, the pop culture reference are way too many, and even the moral does nothing to support the movie. In fact can I even call it a movie!? I give credit to its cast including TJ Miller, Anna Farris and Patrick Stewart, but their talents are just wasted in this movie. And can't believe I have to say this, but this movie even had the balls to steal the plots from other movies like The LEGO Movie, Wreck-It Ralph and Inside Out. I mean...really!? Sony cancelled The Popeye Movie for this!?

Every choice is non-sensical and stupid, every character is cruel and mean-spirited, every joke is flat and annoying, every app promoted in this movie is pandering the audience, every emotional and \"profound\" scene it's stupid and puts sad music to treat the audience like stupid, every piece of animation is done badly, everything this movie presents has already done a million times better. It is one of the worst animated movies i've ever seen and it's not even suitable for children, it's a terrible kids film and a failure of animation. Avoid it as much as you can. Do not be fooled, because it's not enjoyable bad, this is painfully bad.","displayName":"Joka Manuel P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-09-01T15:22:04.000Z","updateDate":"2017-09-23T11:09:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"931715074","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joka Manuel P","accountLink":"/user/id/931715074"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 01, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Probably the worst movie ever.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/705079186350105/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-09-01T15:00:09.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-08T17:16:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"976659713","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976659713"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 01, 2017"}]}
