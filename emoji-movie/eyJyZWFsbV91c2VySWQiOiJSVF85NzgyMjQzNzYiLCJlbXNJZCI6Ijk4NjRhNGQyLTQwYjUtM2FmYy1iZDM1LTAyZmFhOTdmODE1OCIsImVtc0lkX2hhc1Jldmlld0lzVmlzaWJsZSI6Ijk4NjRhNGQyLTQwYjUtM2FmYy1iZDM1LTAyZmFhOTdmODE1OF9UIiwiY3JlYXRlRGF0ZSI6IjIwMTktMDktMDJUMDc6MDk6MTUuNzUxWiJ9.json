The characters are T.J Miller, Wild Styl- I mean jailbreak, and Jimmy Corden. Jailbreak is a great character. They even made her say \"You know women are doing things men are taking credit for\" Great Message for kids! The main plot is that Gene is trying to express himself more with other emoji's.

You cannot understate the Emoji Movie's accomplishments and daring, not to mention that superb animation. There's really no point of me trying to explain why the movie works so well, it's like the poster's tagline: An adventure beyond words. Anyone who doesn't like it should go and watch their hipster-trash garbage like the horrendous Edgar Wright movies, or the Lord of the Rings.
