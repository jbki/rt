Critics don't know what they're talking about when they give it low scores. The movie was written for intelligent people, not critics. Go see it. Go see it again. Go see it another time. Go see it as many times as you can. Use all of your money to see this movie over and over and over. I'm already in the red, and am heavily indebted to the mafia, who want to break my legs. Little do they know that if they break my legs, I won't be able to walk, and will be able to spend the rest of my days watching this movie again and again and again.\n\nGo see it.","displayName":"meme B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T15:43:53.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T15:47:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"976579271","realm":"RT","displayName":"meme B","accountLink":"/user/id/976579271"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Sorry to the people that put their time into The Emoji Movie, but I hate this movie with all my being. I have not seen this movie, and I try not to judge something too much before I have seen it, but I already know that this has to be one of the worst things produced in a very long time. Not that it's probably badly made, because they hired good actors, good animators, and used a reliable script formula. The problem here lies in the very premise. If it weren't for the fact of the popular culture surrounding the emoji, then this movie would have been struck down in the earliest stages, but all that matters is that the repetitive merchandising of children's movies is a horribly desperate scheme for more money. I know someone who created this could have had a dream and an idea for this sad incarnation of new age human emotion, but I really could not ever give any kind of support to this movie, not genuinely or ironically.","displayName":"Alec G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100003940420366/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T15:41:38.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T18:41:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"948745976","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alec G","accountLink":"/user/id/948745976"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Honestly probably the greatest film I have ever seen. The story had no plot holes and this movie excelled in humor. I swear I nearly choked on my popcorn laughing so hard while watching this film. If I could give this work of art a 6th star I would. Greatest film that has ever seen the big screen, truly a masterpice that I advise all to see, young or old.","displayName":"Cole W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T15:41:35.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T15:46:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"976579291","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cole W","accountLink":"/user/id/976579291"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"best movie i've ever seen! 10/10 i only wish that there were more poop jokes and Meh was a great character.  i will make sure to go see this movie again! loved it!","displayName":"Gahoy G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T15:41:04.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T20:54:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"976579289","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gahoy G","accountLink":"/user/id/976579289"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was amazing","displayName":"Mariana R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T15:40:56.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-03T17:59:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"976579285","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mariana R","accountLink":"/user/id/976579285"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"While I watched this move toxicated it might have just been the worst experience ever.","displayName":"Brian S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T15:37:49.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T15:37:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"975117697","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brian S","accountLink":"/user/id/975117697"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was truly a masterpiece.
