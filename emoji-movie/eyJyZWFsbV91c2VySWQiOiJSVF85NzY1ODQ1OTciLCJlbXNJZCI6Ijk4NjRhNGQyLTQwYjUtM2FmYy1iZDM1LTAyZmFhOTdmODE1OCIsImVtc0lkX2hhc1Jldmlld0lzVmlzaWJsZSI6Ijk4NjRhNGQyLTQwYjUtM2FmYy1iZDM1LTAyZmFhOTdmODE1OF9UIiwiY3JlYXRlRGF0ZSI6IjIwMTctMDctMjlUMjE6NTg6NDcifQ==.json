I am studying both young and old viewers and their prespectives, and here is my rough estimate of the review. Also, there will be my prespective as well. If you don't like reading, then go to the bottom. Anyways, let's dive in. Let's go to the young person's prespective: The Emoji Movie is a fresh, new movie for them. It simulates their lifestyle. Right now, people are using more emojis every day. It is ome of the best inventions since the mobile phone. The emojis can comunicate to our people more better. We can express our feelings more than just text. The movie has all of that and many more. This movie is really good for young people because they use Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube.This movie can simulate all that. If all the young people had to gave it a rating, it would be on average 4.8 stars, which will round to 5. But then, there's the older people. You know, the people who prefer Atomic Blond instead of this. Anywho, If you look at this movie on the older person's prespective, you know why thy hated it. It's another cash grab shitfest that gives them headaches. All the jokes are too stale, the plot is barely visible, It's like Inside Out, but worse, which is ironic considering that Inside Out has a Tomatometer of 98%, and it's basically Inside Out, but with emojis. I'm pretty sure that the old viewers would give it a 1.5 stars. And here is my prespective, which no one would care. The Emoji Movie is not really terrible. Most people always skin every single movie without looking deep through it. I actually have to see it 3 times, 2 which I already been. If you actually look really deep into it, then you can actually enjoy every movie, no matter how shitty, or how awesome it is. That's the secret to all this. You have to really go deep into a movie to actually get the full picture. Even if you already go deep into this, try harder until you're 100% certain there is nothing. The Emoji Movie has some things that are hidden that you need to see. The only thing is that you have to go deep to see it. Alright, here comes the ratings. For young viewers, it's a 5 star for them. For old viewers, it would be 1.5. Mne would be a exact 4 stars. Is it good? Yes. Would your kids like it? Certanly. Would the adults like it without their kids? They would like it. Will it b fun if you bring your kids? No. Either leave your kids in the theater and go do something else, or better yet, take your kids in a kid-friendly cinema (A.K.A a room full of kids and a oppisite, seperate room for adults.) and see it there, or better yet, go alone, or with your friends, and go see it. In, all of this,\n\n(TL;DR) The Emoji Movie is a good movie. Just, don't bring your kids in any movie at all. Rating: 4 stars.\n\nThat is all, and I hope I can help everyone. Also, for some people that has some questions, This is an actual review. I'm not joking about any of this. Alright, Thank you.\n\n-M.

This movie is ground breaking; the visuals are so tight. Better animation hasn't been seen. the comedic timing kept me laughing the entire way through, and the points of tension has me on the edge of my seat. I didn't excpect the movie to be so terrifying; at moments I couldn't watch I was so terrified. That movie could have been considered horror. I came in expecting a light-hearted surface level movie, but I came out feeling enlightened. The film chose to tackle many controvertial topics such as: Women being under represented, technology dependance, addiction, self-aceptance, marital issues, and that only scrapes th surface. The characters are extremely rounded(pun intended), and I think we all have gone through the feeling of not fitting in before, or not being able to tell someone your true feelings. In essence we can all find a little Gene in all of us making him very relatable. The reason I didn't give it a 5 star is that Gene and Jailbreak didn't kiss which left their arc a litle unfinished for me. In conclusion, the emoji movie is a visual masterpiece that deserves more praise than it does, but could use more kissing(I think we can all agree on that:))","displayName":"max b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T21:06:56.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T21:24:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"976584423","realm":"RT","displayName":"max b","accountLink":"/user/id/976584423"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"}]}
