When I first heard of the emoji movie I imagined many different ways Sony animations could have made this a great movie, but what we were left with was a desperate attempt for money with all the advertisement made throughout the movie was so obvious that they didn't even try to hide it or at least make it a bit less obvious. overall I think Son animations tainted their reputation  and it will take some time for them to move on from it and they wont be doing it with another smurfs movie.","displayName":"Derek H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-10T11:36:12.000Z","updateDate":"2017-12-16T08:47:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"976071554","realm":"RT","displayName":"Derek H","accountLink":"/user/id/976071554"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 10, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie ever I want second part this time with fidget spinners ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????","displayName":"Andrew O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-10T09:54:18.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-10T09:56:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"976614033","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew O","accountLink":"/user/id/976614033"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 10, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I dont care what people say.
