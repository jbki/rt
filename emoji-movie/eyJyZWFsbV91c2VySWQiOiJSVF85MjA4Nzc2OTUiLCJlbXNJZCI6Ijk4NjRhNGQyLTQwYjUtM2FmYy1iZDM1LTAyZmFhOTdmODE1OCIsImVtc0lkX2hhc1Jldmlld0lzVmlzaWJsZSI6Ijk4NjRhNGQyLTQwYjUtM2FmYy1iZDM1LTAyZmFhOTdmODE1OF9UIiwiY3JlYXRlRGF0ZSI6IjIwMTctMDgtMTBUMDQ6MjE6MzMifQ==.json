Couldn't they add even more! My favourite part was when they danced the emoji dance in the Just Dance Official App downloadable for free on android and iOS. Sadly Jailbreak and Gene don't hook up but that hardly impacts the emojinol rollercoaster that is the Emoji Movie (In cinemas now) I highly recommend that you watch this movie, I loved to so much I have a small picture of gene in my room I pray to before I go to sleep","displayName":"Emoji%20 M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-10T01:36:30.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-10T01:40:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"976613530","realm":"RT","displayName":"Emoji%20 M","accountLink":"/user/id/976613530"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 10, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The worst movie of 2017","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1633488273362424/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-09T23:22:40.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-09T23:23:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"976613413","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976613413"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 09, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I am not saying that this is the worst movie I ever seen life. There is also a reason that this is not the worst movie I ever seen in my life. When I heard of all the crap this movie was getting with the reviews and such with the community I just had to check it for myself. I work at a movie theater, so I get to see movies for free. I went on Sunday night during opening weekend to see this movie, and guys, it was so terrible. Seriously, why was this movie ever made? Every single joke felt flat, every single plot development was so predictable, the visuals are incredibly bland, there is just plain lazy product placement just about everywhere in this movie, I sat there watching the movie in disbelief. It was so bad in fact, I walked out without even finishing it. Trust me, avoid the hell out of this movie. I feel sorry for anyone who had to make this piece of crap, release it in theaters, for the people who paid money for them and the kids to see it, everything. My god! Some of you may think seeing movies for free is all fun and games, but its not all fun, its not all fun.","displayName":"Matthew L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-09T23:11:30.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-09T23:15:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"905667783","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew L","accountLink":"/user/id/905667783"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 09, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I guess it should have been a red flag when the theatre was nearly empty, but we still stayed .

The positive reviews convinced me to give it a chance even though I was opposed to it from the start and I could not have had a more egregious blow to my faith in humanity. This 'movie' is more akin to an hour and a half long advertisement/propaganda piece. The characters spend literally 5 minutes playing candy crush and they couldn't stop saying App names to save their lives. The side-kicks were the traditional 'I'm a fat guy who says random things to appeal to kids' and the Nuevo-feminist 'I DON'T WANT TO BE A PRINCESS I'M STRONG ON MY OWN.' Which, guys, doesn't need to be an actual line of dialogue. Princess Fiona from Shrek showed her strength and independence far more effectively to the point where I remember her name offhand after not having seen the movie for years. I honestly can't remember the name of the girl emoji and I saw the film literally yesterday. They try to play off both a romantic feeling and an 'I Don't Need No Man' message and they just both end up feeling contrived and disingenuous. She ends up coming off more as a character who's either lying to herself or lying to others because she doesn't really have any long term consistency. The overall message seems to be 'Use these apps we advertised, send emojis to people to make them like you, also strong women don't ever fall in love because they don't need men'.","displayName":"Slaanesh T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-09T23:00:09.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-09T23:13:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"976613399","realm":"RT","displayName":"Slaanesh T","accountLink":"/user/id/976613399"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 09, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"this was a good movie now people are gonna hate me","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/525933824404940/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-09T22:26:32.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-09T22:27:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"976613353","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976613353"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 09, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Worst movie i've ever seen.","displayName":"Tad H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/585356218285548/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-09T22:15:51.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-09T22:16:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"973936728","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tad H","accountLink":"/user/id/973936728"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 09, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"anyone with common sense knows this is garbage plain and simple.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1934475243436325/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-09T18:24:29.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-09T18:26:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"976612933","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976612933"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 09, 2017"}]}
