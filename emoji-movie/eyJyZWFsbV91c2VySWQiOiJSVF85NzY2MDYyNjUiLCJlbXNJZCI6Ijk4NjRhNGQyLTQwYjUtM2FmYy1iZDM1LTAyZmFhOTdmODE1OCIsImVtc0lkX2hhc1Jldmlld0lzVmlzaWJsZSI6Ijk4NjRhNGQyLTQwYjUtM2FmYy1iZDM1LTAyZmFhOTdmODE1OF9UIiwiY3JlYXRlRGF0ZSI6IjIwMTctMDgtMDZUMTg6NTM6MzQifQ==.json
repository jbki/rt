I saw it last night and it was so beautiful it brought me to tears. Such an amazingly written, amazingly directed, amazingly animated movie! Easily the greatest movie so far This year, I would recommend bringing the whole family to this, there is amazing humour and jokes in it, by the five minute mark I was rolling on the ground slapping me knee cause it was so funny! Especially the poop emoji with all of the hilarious and original toilet humor! Don't listen to the negative reviews cause those people are all just haters and don't understand the true brilliance of this movie! I will be spending my $956 dollar pay check on seeing the emoji movie every day this month. I will be bringing everyone I know to this masterpiece! I downloaded the amazing and original soundtrack when I got home and today I spendt $400 on emoji movie merchandise! Please go see this movie cause it is truly amazing! P.S. I definitely wasn't the person who was pleasuring myself in the theatre. The only part I didn't absolutely love is the fact that there was no ??? Emoji! Have a good day thanks for reading my review!????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/343747939391015/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-06T15:08:42.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-06T15:21:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"976605633","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976605633"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 06, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Son and I thought it was too cute.
