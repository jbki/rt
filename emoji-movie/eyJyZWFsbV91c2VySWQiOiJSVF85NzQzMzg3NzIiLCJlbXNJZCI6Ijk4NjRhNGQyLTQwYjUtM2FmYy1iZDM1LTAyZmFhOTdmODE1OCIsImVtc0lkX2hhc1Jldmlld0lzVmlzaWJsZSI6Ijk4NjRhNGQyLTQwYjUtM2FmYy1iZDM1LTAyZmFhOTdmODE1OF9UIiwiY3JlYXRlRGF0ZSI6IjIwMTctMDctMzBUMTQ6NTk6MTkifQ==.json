The minute I finished this masterpiece, My faith in humanity instantly improved. The emoji movie also has a very good message of just be yourself And to accept everyone. Because of its wonderful message I think that every school in the world should play this movie for their students. If you haven't seen this movie, I sincerely suggest you watch it, because it just might change your life like it changed mine. ??","displayName":"Ava%20 M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T14:20:34.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T14:34:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"976586721","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ava%20 M","accountLink":"/user/id/976586721"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Worst movie of 2017.

The idea of using emoji and smartphone is not bad. The animation is good. But there are just something that does not feel right about it. First of all, I kept feeling many parts of the movie was just squeezed in as some kind of commercial. Well to be fair you cannot avoid that so I will let it pass. Second, I know the author is trying to use the idea of emoji but somehow they lack some key understanding of this feature of communication of nowadays. I cannot really tell what is it, but there is just something does not feel right. Third, perhaps my IT background haunted me but some of the idea are just weird. Yes, this is just an animation, but you erase your phone just for a not-repeatable malfunction? An emoji character has the authority to control anti-virus? These ideas are freaking me out actually. Last one, the whole moving is kind of in a rush, which made it quite \"shallow\", if you know what I mean. I cannot really get the idea of this movie. Though I am never a man watching movies for \"morals\", I don't really think a movie for plain story-telling with no morals at all would be a good idea. But anyway, it is still a not-so-bad way o spend an hour or so in the movie theater for this show - just try to empty your brain and don't think deep about it. In that way, you will find it is surprisingly, not as bad as some reviewers rated. (or, it is simply that I should not have watched that FoodFight! crap earlier this month.)","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/134628847136310/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T14:06:39.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T14:35:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"976586678","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976586678"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I would give it 0 stars if I could.
