Jacksfilms was right. Everything about this movie was just amazinig the characters, the plot, all the adds for the apps and games. EVERYTHING. Gene was just amazing T.J. Miller did amazing job on the voice. Sir Patrick Stewart with the poop voice and the jokes was just amazing. Seriously, if you haven't seen this movie yet just go and watch it already as it tops even the Titanic with the love story. And Aeroplane with jokes. The main villain was just amazing as it was honestly better than the Joker or Megamind. I'm shaking while writing this review as deadass this movie was just a masterpiece. 10/10","displayName":"HITAS H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-11-04T16:13:07.000Z","updateDate":"2017-11-04T16:20:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"976831516","realm":"RT","displayName":"HITAS H","accountLink":"/user/id/976831516"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 04, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Cute and funny, my 7 year old son and I enjoyed it.","displayName":"Travis B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/745665942/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-11-04T13:44:01.000Z","updateDate":"2017-11-04T13:44:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"928601421","realm":"RT","displayName":"Travis B","accountLink":"/user/id/928601421"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 04, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie suggests that all teenagers care about is emojis. Why would the creators of this movie paint an image of all teenagers to smaller children that they are dense and completely attached to text messaging? The movie was extraordinarily uninteresting. Why did anyone make this?\n\nMultiple of my friends decided to see it \"just to see how bad it was\". I have also seen many games on the app store based on emojis. I'm getting sick of companies  being so dense and unthoughtful. Watching this was a complete waste of 91 minutes.","displayName":"Leo R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-11-04T10:30:16.000Z","updateDate":"2017-11-04T10:39:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"976827542","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leo R","accountLink":"/user/id/976827542"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 04, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I love it so much I think it's hilarious ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????","displayName":"MK C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-11-03T22:04:07.000Z","updateDate":"2017-11-03T22:11:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"921740784","realm":"RT","displayName":"MK C","accountLink":"/user/id/921740784"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 03, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It was OK.

The movie comes off as a really bland and second rate knock off of inside out. The animation is Saturday morning cartoon quality and the story is ridiculous. It may be an OK babysitter for little kids but even they probably wont enjoy it. Patrick Stewart is entertaining but he is in so little of the film even he comes off disappointing.","displayName":"Jason T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1224397856/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-11-03T11:03:50.000Z","updateDate":"2017-11-03T11:03:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"905459818","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jason T","accountLink":"/user/id/905459818"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 03, 2017"}]}
