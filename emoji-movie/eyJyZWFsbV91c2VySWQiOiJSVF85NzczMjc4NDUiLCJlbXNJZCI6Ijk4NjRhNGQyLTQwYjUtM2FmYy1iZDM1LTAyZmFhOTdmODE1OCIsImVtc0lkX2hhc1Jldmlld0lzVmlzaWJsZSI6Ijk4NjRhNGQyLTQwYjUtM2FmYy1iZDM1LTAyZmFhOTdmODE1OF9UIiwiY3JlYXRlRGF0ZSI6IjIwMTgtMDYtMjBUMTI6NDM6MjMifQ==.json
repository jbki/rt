It has a heartrending story of how Gene wants to just be himself. When Jail Break excepted that she was one of the princess emojis I broke down and cried tears of joy. I was so inspired by The Emoji Movie to be myself and to love everyone for who they are, and that is a lesson no one can pass up! Don't even get me started on how hilarious all the joke are! This movie also includes so many different popular apps all kids love like: Youtube, Just Dance, Candy Crush, and of course Drop Box. I know when I was a young one I always talked to my mom about the wonders of Drop Box's fire wall!","displayName":"Dawson S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-17T10:28:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-17T10:39:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"977323503","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dawson S","accountLink":"/user/id/977323503"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Despite the ratings, this movie is pretty good, it's not Paddington level good but this movie is good","displayName":"Jack B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-17T05:32:15.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-17T05:34:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"977323179","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jack B","accountLink":"/user/id/977323179"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Horrible moving.
