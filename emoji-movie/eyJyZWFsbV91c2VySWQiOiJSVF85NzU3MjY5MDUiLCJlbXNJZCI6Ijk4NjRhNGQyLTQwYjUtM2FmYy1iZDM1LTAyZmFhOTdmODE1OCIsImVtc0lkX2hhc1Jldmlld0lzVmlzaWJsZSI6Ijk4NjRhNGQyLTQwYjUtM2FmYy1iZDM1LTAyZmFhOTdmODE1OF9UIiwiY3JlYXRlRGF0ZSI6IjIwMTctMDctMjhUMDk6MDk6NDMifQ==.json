The jokes are clever and will appeal to kids and adults alike, the story is outstanding and will fiercely pull on your heart-strings, and the animation is mind blowing-ly amazing, making you feel like you're really there with the amazing characters, such as Edgy Girl, Mehrio, and Pile O' Shit. Overall this movie is amazing and is worth watching, even if you miss the birth of your own child to see it. I give the Emoji Movie a 100/10 for being the best movie ever made.","displayName":"Watplr W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T09:01:56.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T09:08:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"976577569","realm":"RT","displayName":"Watplr W","accountLink":"/user/id/976577569"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"This may come as a shock to many of you, but The Emoji Movie is not good. In fact, it's really bad. Bad in the way that it doesn't even try much of the time. Bad in the way that it is intended to be a funny children's film with a message about championing individuality and being yourself, but even that tried and true formula falls flat. Did I say it was supposed to be funny? It's not funny. It tries, it has obvious attempts at humor, but it's not funny. Worse, it has a talented and typically hilarious group of people providing the voices for much of these humanoid expressions that exist in a world that doesn't make much sense in the first place. Let's start over as this would be the initial issue that only leads to more of these problems that spawn from the fact this is a movie based on emoji's. It would probably be big of me to say that this movie isn't bad simply because it is a movie based on emoji's, but it is. It represents everything wrong with the studio system from the perspective of attempting a cash grab without any measure of creativity or thought put into the actual work. There are no signs of life within this thing other than our protagonist going through the motions of feeling like an outcast, being brave enough to break out of his shell, and discover that it's okay to be different. That's all well and good, but you as well as your kids have seen this countless times before and The Emoji Movie brings nothing new to it with the fact it's emoji's going through these (e)motions only making it that much more grating. Worse even, it's beyond transparent that writer/director Tony Leondis (2008's terrible Igor as well as a few other animated shorts) and his two co-writers Eric Siegel (a TV veteran) and Mike White (Mike White!) could care less about the movie they are working on. No doubt receiving an assignment from head honcho's at Sony Animation that they needed something aimed at the kids after their one-two punch for teens and adults with Spider-Man: Homecoming and Baby Driver the studio latched on to current trends via The LEGO Movie and Wreck-it Ralph and demanded a movie based on those faces kids were using to communicate with on their phones. Leondis, Siegel, and White mix in a little Toy Story as well with hopes of no one noticing and yet The Emoji Movie is so distractingly bad that it doesn't become an issue of the movie being based around characters who are emoticons, but more the fact the whole thing never breaks through that barrier of convincing us why it's necessary.      \n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com","displayName":"Philip P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1025970122/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T08:56:50.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T08:56:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"783764844","realm":"RT","displayName":"Philip P","accountLink":"/user/id/783764844"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Emotional, thought-provoking and just an overall fun ride through the smart phone.
