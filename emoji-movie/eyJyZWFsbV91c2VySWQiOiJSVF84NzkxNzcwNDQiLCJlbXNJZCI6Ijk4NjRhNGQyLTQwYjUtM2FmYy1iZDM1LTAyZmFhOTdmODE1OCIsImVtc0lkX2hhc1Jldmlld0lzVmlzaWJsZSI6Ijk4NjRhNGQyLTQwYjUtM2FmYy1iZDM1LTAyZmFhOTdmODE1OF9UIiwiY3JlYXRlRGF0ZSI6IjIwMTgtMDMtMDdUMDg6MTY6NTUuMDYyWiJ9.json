To be fair, this is the best way make a movie about emojis. Not that it's the best movie, but it's the only way to make a movie of emojis. The humor was all over the place. Loved that.

And they totally succeeded; mostly. Some of the humor was actually pretty funny, although the story and premise were still completely awful.
