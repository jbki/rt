Where? During commercial breaks on tv. This film is one big commercial. They literally play Candy Crush and Just Dance! They also fly on the Twitter bird, go through the sound waves of Spotify, enter the Cloud through Dropbox, etc. The characters are forgettable. The has been told so many other times, in much better movies (Inside Out, The Lego Movie). The jokes are cringey as hell. There are so many problems with this movie, that the only reason why it gets a half star is because the animation is not bad (although it's not particularly unique either). This movie isn't like The Room, where it's so bad but so enjoyable at the same time, and therefore is remembered as a classic today. This movie should be forgotten completely. Unbelievable that this movie came from a company that made good movies in the past. Even more unbelievable that they shelved the Popeye movie to make this film.","displayName":"Daniel P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-10T17:02:21.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-10T17:08:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"964563340","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel P","accountLink":"/user/id/964563340"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Not a joke I really liked it but it's a copycat but the lesson is good so congrats your first 5 stars.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1187311378085534/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-07T23:15:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-07T23:21:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"977527066","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977527066"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"the good: the animation. it probably looks like one of the best-looking animations that I've seen.\nThe Bad: The plot.

It actually isn't the worst, and the bright colors gives it a more child-like appeal. And I thought that making the \"old-school\" emoticons senior citizens (like :0) was quite clever.\nBad: That plot. It's like Wreck It Ralph, Inside Out, and The Lego Movie mixed with emojis and gave birth to a disgusting baby. The character literally gets threatened just because he makes a different face. Huh? I expected something bad, but I remembered what I thought about The Lego Movie and decided to give it a chance. The jokes were very tired (mostly about the poop emoji), and the characters are actually kind of irritating in a way. \nWTF?: I'm sorry if I sound immature for this, but HOW DO YOU PLAY \"JUST DANCE\" ON A PHONE? There were some very big holes in the plot, and I'm not exactly into the voices in the characters. They all just seem tired and sleepy.\n\nOverall: Huge nope. If you see this movie, take two steps back each time.","displayName":"Eliza H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-06T19:15:41.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-06T19:23:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"977522267","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eliza H","accountLink":"/user/id/977522267"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 06, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"When you think of classic movies,what do you think of?Mulan?The emperors new groove?Do you really want to call this a classic?Do you really want to show your kids this?No.Remember that it takes an entire team to make this.It takes a group of people to sit down and say \"this is a great idea.\"","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/341817119897796/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-05T13:43:43.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-05T13:48:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"977515829","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977515829"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"dis mooviwe quz gud from sdtaRT to end big moon man from viloge prooteict hsi felow m em by giuong ujndederxover in de e val ophomne tje m aien   gury      hauz byporlar bot stull proticrts de viloge","displayName":"Dmitri V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-04T23:25:36.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-04T23:27:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"977513161","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dmitri V","accountLink":"/user/id/977513161"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Despite trying to be different from the rest of the movies, the only thing different is the superficial, the only fact that no one could think of a movie of the emojis, however, it is only in the superficial, and that level of script reaches be very heavy to compare it to other movies. 6/20","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/311805179632797/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-04T20:15:09.000Z","updateDate":"2018-10-04T20:15:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"977512547","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977512547"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The very best animated flim for kids in a while.
