This is one movie that changes you with in the first seconds of its run time, and one that will continue to change generations in cinema as we know it. It stars three wonderful main characters that shows the different sides of society, with such such complex character arcs and the most shocking part of it is that it's a kids movie. One of the things that stood out the most to me was the beautiful and groundbreaking animation style.  If you are fan of animation, this is a must see for you, because they manage to do something no one has ever done before: Emojis dancing. I know it sounds insane,  and I couldn't believe it myself when I started watching this film, but they did it! And don't even get me started on the message.  Oh boy, it teaches kids about the importance of helping others and finding who you truly are instead of trying to be someone else to fit in. This is a message never ever seen in other movies before, and they also managed to tackle important issues of our modern society, such as emoji discrimination; a truly important problem. And finally, what I think wraps everything together and makes this an extraordinary film is the jokes. I spent the whole movie laughing at its amazing and clever comedy, with so many jokes that definitely don't feel repetitive (and use things like poop) truly amazing. In conclusion, the emoji movie is a film that any age demographic can watch and feel different as they leave the cinema, and I truly encourage everyone to go watch this masterpiece. I rate it 100/100","displayName":"Eliot G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-27T14:01:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-27T14:01:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"977293209","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eliot G","accountLink":"/user/id/977293209"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Nope.
