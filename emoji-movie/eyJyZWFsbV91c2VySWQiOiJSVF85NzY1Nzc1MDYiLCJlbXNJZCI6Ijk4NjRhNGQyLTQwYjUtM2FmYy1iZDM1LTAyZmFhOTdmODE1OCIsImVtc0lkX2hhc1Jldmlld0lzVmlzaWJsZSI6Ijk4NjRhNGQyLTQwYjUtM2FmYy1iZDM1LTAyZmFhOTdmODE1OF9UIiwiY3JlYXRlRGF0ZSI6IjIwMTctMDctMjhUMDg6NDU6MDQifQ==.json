It's a wonder of modern day cinema and the animation is purely wonderful. The characters have very fleshed out backstories and are extremely interesting. I found myself crying at parts and laughing at others. This movie is gut-wrenching with a bit emotional, dare I say Emojinal, pull. I love the voice acting, especially from Shit Patrick Stewart voicing the \"Poop\" emoji. I don't think any movie could top how amazing this is, I without a doubt recommend you see it at once, and I am extremely psyched for the second one, \"An Emojinal Rollercoaster\"","displayName":"Kai C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T08:36:36.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T08:39:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"976577480","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kai C","accountLink":"/user/id/976577480"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie of 2017, no, best move ever. I watched this at the first showing and it was amazing. TJ Miller had his best performance yet in this, and it shows. I watched every countdown with Jacksfilms, and got more and more exited each time. I wish I could give more than 5 stars.","displayName":"Ya b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T08:34:32.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T08:38:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"976577468","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ya b","accountLink":"/user/id/976577468"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A masterpiece in cinematography","displayName":"Keith L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T08:16:29.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T08:18:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"976577422","realm":"RT","displayName":"Keith L","accountLink":"/user/id/976577422"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Do not listen to the critics!! All bad reviews are fake news!! Truly sad! Emoji movie is a peak of cinematic humor, storytelling and a technical feat. Sony pictures animation helped me find god.
