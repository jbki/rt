Kids deserve better movies, movies that aren't made purely for corporate interests in order to sell them Youtube, Spotify, Dance Dance Revolution, Candy Crush and whatever app is going to give those kids the cool new Emoji Movie Apps (Which I don't believe is out yet, but it will be and when it is I promise you it won't be free). It's not got anything interesting or original in it. It's competently made certainly, the frame size is consistant, there's maybe one line that got a laugh and the designs aren't awful to look at but... come on Sony, you can do better than this. You can do so much better than this.","displayName":"Lee B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1210961186/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-09-09T21:28:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-01-17T00:20:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"876803268","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lee B","accountLink":"/user/id/876803268"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 09, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Although with the bright colours and animation, The Emoji Movie has horrible jokes, story, dialogue and ideas.
