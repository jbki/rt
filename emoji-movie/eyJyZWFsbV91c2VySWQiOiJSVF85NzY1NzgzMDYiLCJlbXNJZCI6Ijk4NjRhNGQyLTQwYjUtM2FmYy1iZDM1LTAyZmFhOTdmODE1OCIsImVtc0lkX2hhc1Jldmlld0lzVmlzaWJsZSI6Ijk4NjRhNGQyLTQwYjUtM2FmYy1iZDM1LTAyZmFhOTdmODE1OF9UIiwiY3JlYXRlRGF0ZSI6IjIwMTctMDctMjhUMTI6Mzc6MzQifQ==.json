There where a few Star Trek Next Generation jokes in there from the Emoji Poop. That where pretty funny. A few adult jokes in there.

The story is lazy and unoriginal, the jokes aren't funny and the characters aren't interesting. This is a cringy film not just because of the EMOJIs but also because it uses trends from years ago and SIR PATRICK STEWART is just there to say poop jokes. like its main character, this movie is just \"meh\"","displayName":"Yohai E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T12:10:46.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T12:30:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"976578158","realm":"RT","displayName":"Yohai E","accountLink":"/user/id/976578158"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I really liked this film it really shows the struggle of man wanting to over power turmoil","displayName":"Hayden K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T12:10:08.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T12:11:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"976578206","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hayden K","accountLink":"/user/id/976578206"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"me me a big waste of time and an excuse for Hollywood to make more garbage movies such as this","displayName":"EMMA P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T12:09:24.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T12:13:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"976578197","realm":"RT","displayName":"EMMA P","accountLink":"/user/id/976578197"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"}]}
