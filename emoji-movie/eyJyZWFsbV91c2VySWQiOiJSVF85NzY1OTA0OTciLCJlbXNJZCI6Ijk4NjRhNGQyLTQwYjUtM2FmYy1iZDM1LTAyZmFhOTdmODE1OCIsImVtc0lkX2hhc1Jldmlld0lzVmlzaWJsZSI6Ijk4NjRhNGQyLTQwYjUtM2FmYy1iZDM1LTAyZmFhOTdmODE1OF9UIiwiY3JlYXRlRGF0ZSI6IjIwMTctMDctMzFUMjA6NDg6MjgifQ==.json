Although, despite the terrible puns, the concept was interesting - it would have been simple to make a much better movie, but it had the same kind of charm that The Room does. I would advise seeing it for free, but not to see it in theatres or buy a copy. Although The Emoji Movie is catered towards children it doesn't that very well. Lastly, the funniest and classiest jokes were about the poop emoji, and were actually an entertaining feature. In my opinion The Emoji Movie was a decent movie at best and definitely deserved all the \"Shit-Posting\" it was given during the creation.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1876717242647014/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-31T20:22:01.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-31T20:31:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"976590446","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976590446"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 31, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was the most amazing movie I have ever seen.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/4262891708479/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-31T20:20:00.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-31T20:20:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"976590442","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976590442"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 31, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Bad movie with bad characters and an even worse plot.","displayName":"Nate H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-31T20:19:25.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-31T20:20:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"976590440","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nate H","accountLink":"/user/id/976590440"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 31, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Just want to kill myself","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/850940931735348/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-31T20:10:29.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-31T20:11:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"976590426","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976590426"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 31, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"If I could give this movie 6 1/2 stars I would. Let me just start by saying the plot line was impeccable. The twists and turns that occur within the story exceeded my expectations. Maybe even more than The Blindside. Without a doubt I would see this again. It was totally worth the $15 to see it. Each punchline, especially the ones involving punny humor ?, were received by the crowd with abounding laughter. Jacksfilms and the actors chosen for the parts did a spectacular job at grasping each and every emoji's personality. Even down to the amazing princess/ Jailbreak!! I would just like to thank this generation for creating a world in which we have the freedom to express ourselves in this way with emojis, and a HUGE thank you to the production of this movie to prove that. This movie really has set a great example for the younger generations and it has helped me put my faith back in humanity. Thank you.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-31T19:59:40.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-31T20:03:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"976590370","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976590370"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 31, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"This is the worst movie that you will ever see in your entire life\nIt has the same plot every stereotypical Disney movie ever created. \nHe wants to fit in, he makes a mistake and he goes on an adventure with a girl and a \"funny\" companion.
