But for the quick review, i love The Emoji Movie. It is really good despite that a hatebase was evolved after the film came out. Trust me, i hate the hatebase for this film.

Do not go against me for loving a movie that they criticize.","displayName":"Damian L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-24T15:30:14.000Z","updateDate":"2017-12-24T15:32:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"963615642","realm":"RT","displayName":"Damian L","accountLink":"/user/id/963615642"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 24, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Yeah.

Hell, ive seen first time  animated companies make better movies. No heart or soul in this film. Mediocre voice acting. Animation was nice it self but ive seen similar if not BETTER in movies like Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs and the short film In a Heartbeat. Story line was bland. Never will watch again. If How To Train Your Dragon 2 could make me feel things and even make me cry there is no excuse for the Emoji movie.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1887891124858420/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-22T22:17:23.000Z","updateDate":"2017-12-22T22:23:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"976985109","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976985109"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 22, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"excellent movie! \nit was funny, cute, interesting and delivered a great message.\nthe animation should at least get 80% \nnonetheless, it offers great values for kids such as 'being yourself','helping out others', and expressing one's own opinion instead of conforming to the crowd.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1782801808397994/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-21T17:04:03.000Z","updateDate":"2017-12-21T17:10:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"976978457","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976978457"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2017"}]}
