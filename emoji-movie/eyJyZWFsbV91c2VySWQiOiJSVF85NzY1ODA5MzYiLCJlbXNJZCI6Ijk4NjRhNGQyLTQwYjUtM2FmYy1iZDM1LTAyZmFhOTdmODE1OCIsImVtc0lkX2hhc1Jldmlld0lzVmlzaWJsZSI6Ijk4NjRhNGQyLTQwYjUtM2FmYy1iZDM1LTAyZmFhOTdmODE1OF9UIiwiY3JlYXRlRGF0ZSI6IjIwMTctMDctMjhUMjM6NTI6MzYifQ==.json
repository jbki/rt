It was much like what I would imagine an acid trip to feel like. My body was trembling the whole time, I had goosebumps and once I heard the quote \"there's no point in looking out for number one, if there's no number twos\", I started sweating. I wish I had a device that would allow me to forget the emoji movie, just so I can watch it again and relive the feeling of being awoken. The whole of the movie has subtle social commentary about gender, equality, and feeling comfortable in your own skin. Jailbreak, the major female role in the movie and the hacker was originally a princess who dean yes to express herself dofferently than the way her emoji forced her to be. She broke free from social restrictions by expressing herself differently. I found this truly profound. The only problems I had with the movie were 1. That the eggplant emoji was considered an unused emoji, even tho it represent dat phat dick. and 2. there was a lack of racial and sexual diversity presented by the emojis. Furthermore there was only one strong female character in the whole movie. A particularly interesting scene in the movie was when Jailbreak and Meh were traveling through soundcloud. Jailbreak spots a whale sound and this bitch sound like she finns bought to nut as she moans at its beauty. While this was unusual for a kids movie I enjoyed that it shows women they have a voice sexually, as women are often repressed from expressing pleasure. To be fair though, this movie was truly a masterpiece. It unlocked a whole new dimension in my mind that i never knew existed. The soundtrack, the jokes, the slang, all were really hip and and with the teens. If i could give this movie a higher rating I would. This is my bible. Jesus isn't my savior, the emoji movie is.","displayName":"hanna i","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T23:45:04.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T00:04:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"976580923","realm":"RT","displayName":"hanna i","accountLink":"/user/id/976580923"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"it was good.  idk why people are giving bad reviews.  go see it and review yourself :-)","displayName":"Naomi O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T23:40:27.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T23:40:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"976580915","realm":"RT","displayName":"Naomi O","accountLink":"/user/id/976580915"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"If you take the absolute value of garbage, you would get this movie.","displayName":"Paul B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T23:36:30.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T23:38:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"936748569","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paul B","accountLink":"/user/id/936748569"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It wasn't as good as storks, but it was vastly better than boss baby.
