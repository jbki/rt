I recently watched it and this movie is actually pretty funny and perfect for if you need to get into a better mood.  I would 100% watch it again. I think the main problem with the negative reviews is the reviewers are older individuals that just don't know how to enjoy a movie for what it is... the movie is great. Just relax and have fun for once...

Don’t believe me? Here: The movies revolve around our main character, who was born in a different way from his surrounding world, concerning his parents on wether or not he should go to the family’s job. When his parents finally work up the courage to take the main character to his first day at work, he accidentally causes a mistake that badly damaged the work area. Later that day, the main character decides that he can be just like everyone else, and goes on an adventure to worlds he’s never seen to give out a “Don’t judge a book by its cover” message. AND there’s also shameless product placement sprinkled throughout and very underdeveloped characters if that wasn’t bad enough. Don’t watch it.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-23T02:47:49.563Z","updateDate":"2018-08-23T02:47:49.563Z","user":{"userId":"260158801","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260158801"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 23, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Just bad.
