This movie captures the very soul of this generation. The jokes are priceless, the animation and the controls are like nothing you've ever seen before. I would rate 10 stars if I could. Not only does this movie have a clear message delivered in an ongaging and humorous storyline, but it also serves as a helpful reminder that the Just Dance App is now available and free on the app store!

Beautiful animation. Stunning character design and development. An important moral to be thought to all kids using this very clever movie. An overall beautiful,stunning and touching movie. The only criticism I have is that it didn't have much poop jokes. The poop jokes are funny. More funnier than pee pee,actually. I would definitely go to The Emoji Movie 2.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1831831343799277/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T06:19:31.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T06:22:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"976581568","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976581568"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I don't know what they were thinking","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T06:00:16.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T06:00:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"976581534","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976581534"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Straight up pile of shit","displayName":"Sonora C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T05:59:17.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T05:59:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"976581532","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sonora C","accountLink":"/user/id/976581532"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"}]}
