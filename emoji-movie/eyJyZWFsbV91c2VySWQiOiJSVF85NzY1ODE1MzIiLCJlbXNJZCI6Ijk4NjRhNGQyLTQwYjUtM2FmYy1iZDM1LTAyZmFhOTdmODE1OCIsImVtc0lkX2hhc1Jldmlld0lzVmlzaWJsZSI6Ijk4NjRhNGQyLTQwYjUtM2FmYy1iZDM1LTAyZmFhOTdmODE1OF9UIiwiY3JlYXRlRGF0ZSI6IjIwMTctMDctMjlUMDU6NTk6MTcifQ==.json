The mere idea of a movie based on little faces we use on our phones makes wrench. It's quite sad that now the movie industry has focused on being hip,trendy,non original, garbage that desperately try to take your money. Movies used to be filled with creativity. Movie makers could express their imagination and also pocket some cash. Now movies only exist for money. Big company's that are to LAZY to make original content make this type of trash. It was obvious from the start that this movie would be the pandering garbage it is. I pray to LORD that this stomach wrenching movie doesn't start a trend of movies like this. If I was given one wish it would be to erase this movie from existence so that future generations don't see this God awful movie.","displayName":"turtle g","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T05:56:28.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T06:04:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"976581527","realm":"RT","displayName":"turtle g","accountLink":"/user/id/976581527"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Honestly, I didn't plan on seeing this movie when I saw the trailers but my friends didn't want to see other movies out so we saw this. Big mistake. The Emoji movie doesn't even deserve a meh joke because it's failure to craft up any coherent multi scene plot line made me feel almost angry. I could never decide if the creators wanted this to be more like Wreck It Ralph or Inside Out (both great movies), but their inability to decide resulted in a piece of trash being made. What bothered me most about The Emoji Movie, other than its inability to create tension, was how it actually got a few basic computer facts wrong. In its weird journey to plug as many apps as possible, the writers put the end goal as Dropbox, a place the characters claimed would allow them to change their code. As a person who took computer science, I can tell you that is not how coding works. If the Unicode (emojis) needed to be changed, it would be in Operational Memory, a place much much harder to get to than Dropbox (and I think would have made a much more interesting journey). Overall, The Emoji movie may have a place as \"The Room\" of terrible animated films.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T05:48:50.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T05:49:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"976581490","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976581490"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"What's the emoji for suicide in the theater ?....please","displayName":"Danis T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T05:39:19.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T05:39:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"928386780","realm":"RT","displayName":"Danis T","accountLink":"/user/id/928386780"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"awful movie clearly made cause EMOJIS","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1992586071025865/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T05:39:08.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T05:41:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"976581489","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976581489"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This is the lowest rating I can give it... only half a star?","displayName":"will w","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T05:15:06.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T05:46:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"976581449","realm":"RT","displayName":"will w","accountLink":"/user/id/976581449"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing twist at the end, afterwards I truly question my morals and values in life.
