It's comical genius and light-hearted nature really made me enjoy this movie with sincerity. There was a strong character development when it came to Gene realizing that being different is good. There were amazing plot twists that kept the audience on the edge of their seats. It was full of laughs and a joy for the whole family. And yes, while its was probably the most stupid movie I've ever seen, I've never laughed as hard as I did when I watched this. It was fun for the whole family and a real joy for your senses.","displayName":"Vicki P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T13:01:04.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T13:16:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"976586477","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vicki P","accountLink":"/user/id/976586477"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Yesterday I had cancer and this movie cured me right now I'm in my maninsion with my 16 wives writing this review they are all petting me also this is the best amine since Cory in the house thank you Sony you've saved ma liofe","displayName":"Guy F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T12:57:36.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T13:04:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"976586467","realm":"RT","displayName":"Guy F","accountLink":"/user/id/976586467"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Even Sony didn't take it seriously, so why'd they bother making it?","displayName":"Joseph K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T12:46:58.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T12:48:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"976586435","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph K","accountLink":"/user/id/976586435"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"}]}
