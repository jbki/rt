It was NOT made to shove blatant ads, shallow messages, millennial pandering, and stupid references to unsuspecting children.\n\nWith that being said, I've seen worse movies in my life. The Emoji Movie isn't incompetent, but that doesn't mean it's any less lazy, moronic, unoriginal, soulless, unfunny, and mind-numbingly boring as it is. An easy skip, even for ironic viewing.","displayName":"Dawson B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/989361664518475/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-07T18:33:15.000Z","updateDate":"2017-11-25T14:36:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"926573692","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dawson B","accountLink":"/user/id/926573692"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 07, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"10/10 it made me want to die a little bit more than usual","displayName":"Naylene M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1529865117331453/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-07T18:13:40.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-07T18:14:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"972617724","realm":"RT","displayName":"Naylene M","accountLink":"/user/id/972617724"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 07, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"my daughter liked it","displayName":"Steve G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-07T17:12:50.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-07T17:12:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"970215361","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steve G","accountLink":"/user/id/970215361"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 07, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This was honestly quite a bit of fun.

The only real appeal this movie has would be for kids who would beg their parents to see it simply because it features emoji which are nothing but a trend, and like all trends they have a peak and a fall and the peak that Sony Pictures was attempting to capitalize on was long passed. In addition to that much of the plot was not original and has been done before and better I might add. An example being the idea of another world that effects a character outside that world has been done before in Pixar's Inside Out and in that movie the characters both inside the world and outside it were very fleshed out and well done, something i just cannot say about this movie all the characters just felt  lackluster and one dimensional. Now some people may say\"Just because Inside Out came first doesn't mean it was the better version\" and to that i'd say name the forth person to land on the moon without searching for it on the internet. Often times the first one to do something is the one who is remembered and more so if it does it better. In addition to that the comedy which as The Angry Birds Movie has proved can save a movie even if the plot was predictable, seemed just as lackluster as everything else in this movie. Many of the jokes failed to make me laugh and seemed to have a different effect, it made me very angry. There was only one time in the entire movie where a joke was presented that made me laugh and that was when the gag with a Trojan virus being shown as an actual Trojan horse filled with Trojan warriors. Otherwise that was it, no other jokes made me laugh. Another thing I did not like was the placements of actual phone applications such as Dropbox and Candy Crush. Just something about it just made me want to slam my head against a wall. Honestly with trends like emojis i don't understand them but things like this movie make me reprimand them. In conclusion this movie is like a pie that the baker messed up and burned it out of shear anger it's not worth seeing. Seriously what's next fidget spinners the movie?","displayName":"A S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-07T15:23:46.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-07T16:51:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"976608177","realm":"RT","displayName":"A S","accountLink":"/user/id/976608177"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 07, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Honestly the best animated movie I've ever seen.
