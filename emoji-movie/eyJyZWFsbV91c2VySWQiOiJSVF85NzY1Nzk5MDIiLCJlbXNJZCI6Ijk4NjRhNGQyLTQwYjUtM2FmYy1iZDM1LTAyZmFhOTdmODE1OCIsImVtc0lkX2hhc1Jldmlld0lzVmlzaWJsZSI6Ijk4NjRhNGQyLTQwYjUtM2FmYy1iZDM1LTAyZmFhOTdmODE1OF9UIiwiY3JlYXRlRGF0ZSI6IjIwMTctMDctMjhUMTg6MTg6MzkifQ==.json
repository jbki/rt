First, the amount of adult jokes. One of my older cousins actually COUNTED how many jokes. How many? 16. And the Only laughs i heard from children was at the short films before the movie started. Overall, it was MEH. \n\n\n\nPlus all the poop jokes were a stupid amount.","displayName":"Hugh M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T18:02:42.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T20:15:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"976579831","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hugh M","accountLink":"/user/id/976579831"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"People have given this film harsh criticism ever since it was announced, but this is truly the film of the century, incapsulating everything a movie requires to show its excellence. Whether it's the clever jokes and puns strewn about the sub 2 hour film, or the amazing character development we see along Gene's journey, this film will surely impress people of any age. Even your out of touch grandad will surely laugh at jokes like \"throw myself on the barbie'\"-shrimp emoji??. This groundbreaking film has shown us its humble beginnings and, I predict, that it will will rise to be one of the greatest movie franchises of our generation.??????????????????????????????????????????????????????
