Its not interesting; the plots just revolve around the advertisement. The animation however is okay. Basically watch if you want to pay to watch advertisement. the stuff people make on YouTube is more entertaining.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1877369219258799/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-16T11:42:07.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-16T11:50:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"976767278","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976767278"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 16, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Un \"meh\" definiria toda la película.","displayName":"José C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-16T11:04:59.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-16T11:05:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"914535845","realm":"RT","displayName":"José C","accountLink":"/user/id/914535845"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 16, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"One of those fun for kids movies and an adult can stand watching too.","displayName":"Jeff R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-16T10:56:38.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-16T10:56:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"925869485","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeff R","accountLink":"/user/id/925869485"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 16, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Seriously speaking, I just can't see anything wrong with this film.

Not only did I leave a warm imprint indicating where I had sat through the duration of this movie, nay, this masterpiece from the gods, but I also left something essential to a human being's spirit. I left my will to live in that theater, as it was dragged up the screen with the credits. I embraced the emptiness that rocked the core of my being as I stood up, crying whilst applauding my hands raw. The Emoji Movie teaches us a true lesson that some of the wisest of men may never have lived to learn. The one true takeaway: James Corden was a bigger piece of absolute horse shiet than the one Patrick Stewart voiced in this film.","displayName":"Jimbo K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-15T20:38:51.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-15T20:43:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"976765993","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jimbo K","accountLink":"/user/id/976765993"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 15, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Screw this pile of shit movie","displayName":"MeepMorp M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-15T15:03:48.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-15T15:03:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"976765044","realm":"RT","displayName":"MeepMorp M","accountLink":"/user/id/976765044"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 15, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Waste of time and money.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2060281097524516/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-15T11:38:11.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-15T11:39:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"976764510","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976764510"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 15, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Talented cast is hamstrung by this utter dud of a script.
