My friends and I have seen it twice today and we just absolutely love it. It has great acting and story. Strong character development and am amazing ending. I went to this movie thinking nothing but just trash but when I left I couldn't believe how great it was. I was in the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next! The best way to spend your 86 minutes.","displayName":"Mckoy J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-27T21:47:21.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-27T21:49:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"976576248","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mckoy J","accountLink":"/user/id/976576248"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 27, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I dont care its amazing","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/221135528411339/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-27T21:38:29.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-27T21:39:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"976576221","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976576221"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 27, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Bad doesn't even begin to describe this movie.

This movie was just a full on advertisement of the different apps that was shown and also throwing in some cringeworthy jokes that just didn't even work at all. Sony just don't even know what they're even doing anymore since they couldn't make this movie work at all and they seem to rip off elements from other (better) animated movies from the past such as Wreck-it-Ralph, Inside Out, and The Lego Movie. Overall, this movie was really unnecessary, the comedy didn't work, the plot was super predictable, and it lacks creativity. The only good thing I can say about this movie is the animation but it still doesn't save this terrible movie, so I suggest to not waste your money on this. It also still upsets me that the studio made this over a Popeye movie.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-27T20:43:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-03-07T19:45:23.988Z","user":{"userId":"952849384","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/952849384"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 27, 2017"}]}
