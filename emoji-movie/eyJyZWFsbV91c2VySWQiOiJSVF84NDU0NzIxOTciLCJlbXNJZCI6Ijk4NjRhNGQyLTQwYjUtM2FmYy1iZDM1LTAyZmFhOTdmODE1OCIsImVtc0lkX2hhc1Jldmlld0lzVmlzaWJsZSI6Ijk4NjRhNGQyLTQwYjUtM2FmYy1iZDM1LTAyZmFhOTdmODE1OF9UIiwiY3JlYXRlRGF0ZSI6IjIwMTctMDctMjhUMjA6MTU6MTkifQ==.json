The star studded cast truly brings this heartwarming story to life, at one moment it will have you on the edge of your seat with tears swelling in your eyes, the next you will be laughing out loud (or, dare I say, lol?). The humor in this film is far too deep and meaningful for mere children however, so I suggest watching this film alone in the dark, rubbing essential body oils on your bare stomach, be sure you get it in every nook and cranny, you wouldn't want to anger your skin.\n\nI would give The Emoji Movie a 10/10, the excessive use of the N word was a bit much though.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/478002495907423/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T19:47:38.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-19T23:04:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"976580262","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976580262"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"it... it exists I guess, so that's a plus, wait no that's still a negative because \nCHILDREN ARE BEING BORN INTO THE WORLD WHERE THIS IS CONSIDERED CINEMA!
