This is what the film industry has come to: an emoji movie. This morning I woke up and checked the Rotten Tomatoes page and I thought, \"is there really an emoji movie, or is this a twisted, never ending dream-state hell. Nonetheless, I saw this movie for pure hilariousity. I thought I could atleast have a fun time laughing that this movie exists. And I will say, you can complain about anything in the world, but I spent an hour and a half of my life watching this movie, so you will be fine.\n       I'd love to rant about this total abomination all day, but let me talk the legistics. The first thing is the humor: it's painful and unfunny. Most of the jokes are either poop jokes, retired humor from animated movies, or pop culture references, if you can call them that. I sat in this theater and I laughed once in the entire runtime, and the rest of the laughter was kids. This movie has talented voice actors that I really want to give a big hug just because I feel so genuinely bad for them that they had to appear in this film. The voice acting was screaming please get me out of this sound booth and give me my damn money.\n       Now like I said earlier, this movie is a deadbeat playback of animated movie tropes. It's a retired plot and retired humor, and it's unbeleivably painful to sit through. It's almost like a 4 year old got their dad's computer and download their favorite animation movies and just slapped them together and put emojis on their faces. I think I could do a better job making this movie at that age. And in the end, it's all about money. Sony doesn't care if this movie is good or bad, they just see it as a movie about emojis so people will see it cause they like emojis. They just treat us like we don't care if a movie is good or bad, we just want EMOJIS. And if that wasn't bad enough, there's so much product placement is this movie. It takes runtime just to explain what Candy Crush is and how to play it!\n       Overall, this complete utter abomination of missuse of film is unfunny and painful. This isn't just a kids movie, it's a nobody movie. The voice cast has potential but there's no good humor. It's a painful waste of existence. We just have to accept that to most people, there is no purpose to film making anymore! They just want more money! The Emoji Movie is an undeniably terrible cash cow, and it's already the worst movie of the year, if not of all time. Don't see this disgrace to mankind unless it's that or being brutally beat and slowly tortured to death. The Emoji Movie can be described in one emoji: ??","displayName":"Reece L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-15T16:51:18.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T12:11:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"976531864","realm":"RT","displayName":"Reece L","accountLink":"/user/id/976531864"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 15, 2017"}]}
