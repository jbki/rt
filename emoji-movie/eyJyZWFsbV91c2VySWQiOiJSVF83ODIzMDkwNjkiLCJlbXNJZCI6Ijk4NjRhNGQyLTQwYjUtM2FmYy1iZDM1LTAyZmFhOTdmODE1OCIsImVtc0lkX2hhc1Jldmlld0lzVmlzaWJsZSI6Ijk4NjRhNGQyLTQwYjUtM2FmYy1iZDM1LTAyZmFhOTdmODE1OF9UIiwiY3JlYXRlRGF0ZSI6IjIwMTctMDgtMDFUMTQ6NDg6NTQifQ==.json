The Meh emoji (Voiced by impeccable T.J Miller) brought so much nuance into what could've been a bland role, especially with the sexual tension coursing through the veins of Jailbreak (voiced by the emojified goddess Anna Faris). Though I would've liked to see them pound it didn't take away from my enjoyment. I enjoyed all the hip apps they went to on this freshman boy's phone such as Dropbox and Just Dance! Though my only critique would be to show Alex's (voiced by the number 1 hottie that looks like he regrets the last five years, Jake T Austin) extensive porn collection within his secret teen boy storage app and hopefully that will be addressed in the sequel. The parents dynamic was very raw and filled with passion that an audience could connect to.Overall this movie has beaten out every other emotional rollercoaster  and will be remembered as the best of all time.","displayName":"Raven%20 K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-01T12:35:35.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-01T12:42:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"976591830","realm":"RT","displayName":"Raven%20 K","accountLink":"/user/id/976591830"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 01, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Heloo folks this movie is the best arround the world.
