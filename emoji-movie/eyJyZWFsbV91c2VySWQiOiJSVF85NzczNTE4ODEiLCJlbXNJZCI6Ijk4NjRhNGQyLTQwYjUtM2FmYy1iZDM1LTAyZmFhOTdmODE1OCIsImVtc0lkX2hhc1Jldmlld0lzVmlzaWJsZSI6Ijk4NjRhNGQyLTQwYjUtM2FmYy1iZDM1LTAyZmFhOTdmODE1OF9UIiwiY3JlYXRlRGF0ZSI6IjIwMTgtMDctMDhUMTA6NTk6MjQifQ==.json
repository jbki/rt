The plot is just a laughable excuse for a story. It rips off 3 actual cinematic masterpieces since these nitwits say this is. Packed with the saddest jokes, ads, and tear inducing boredom. The emojis look like hairy horse nuts and made me look at emojis in a different way. Back off Emojis. This was 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back from this complete waste of sound and animation.The new Battlefield Earth of the decade.","displayName":"Christian R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-05T07:53:28.000Z","updateDate":"2019-02-26T04:22:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"977343249","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christian R","accountLink":"/user/id/977343249"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"i personally think that this movie is just completely and utterly disgraceful towards society in general. the fact that we had a fricking movie about EMOJIS and not something that is even remotely meaningful a made me realize that we have no hope for the future.

The writers of this movie are clearly out of date with the modern world and the dialogue seems unnatural and forced. The humor is...well not very humorous.
