I think when you see multiple actors take there careers and put it in a paper shredder, it really gives you a thought of how bad this is. Now to start off, the reason why it's one star and not half a star, is because the animation is actually OK. I only say OK, either way your not really even paying attention to it because your cringing so hard you can barely see. The creators of this film took what could have been an amazing opportunity to get creative, and instead decided to use every kid movie cliche in the book. The movies plot all in all is pretty what you would expect (at least from what the trailers told you). 3 misfit emojis go on a mission to save the phone after one of them did something that resulted in a glitch that made the use want to get the phone wiped. We follow our characters (and of course we need a female character so our main protagonists ends up falling in love with her). We have our three typical movie characters. Our protagonist (T.J. Miller) is the one who does not fit in. Our female lead, who is there to both assist our protagonist and later fall in love with by the end of the film, and last we have our comedic relief character who is there just so the kids can laugh. \n\nHere's my advice:\nIf you want to be brain dead, please watch this\n\nIf you still want to remain sane than stay as far away from this film.","displayName":"Maxx P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T17:13:50.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T17:14:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"963781024","realm":"RT","displayName":"Maxx P","accountLink":"/user/id/963781024"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was the best movie I've ever seen.\nI was lucky Jacksfilms pointed toward it.\nI have never experienced a more emojinal film in my life and I personally think I have bean purified by the sheer fabulesness of this movie.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1971697506407042/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T17:05:36.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T17:08:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"976579624","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976579624"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The emoji movie is worth much more than zero percent and it made me laugh in several places","displayName":"Ilene W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/660506448/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T17:03:49.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T17:31:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"805514255","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ilene W","accountLink":"/user/id/805514255"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie is creatively dry","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/191471304723205/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T17:03:13.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T17:04:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"976579608","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976579608"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Completely and uderly crap.
