I mean it's very predictable but has some cute funny gags, so in terms of kids movies I'd actually say it's better than most. There aren't even any consistently annoying characters like there usually are. I would actually recommend it for kids, there are WAY worse kids movies. We were also torched when we watched it, so maybe that had something to do with it lol","displayName":"Sam O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-09-10T11:33:00.000Z","updateDate":"2018-09-10T11:37:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"977081629","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sam O","accountLink":"/user/id/977081629"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I have to say it was the  worst movie I have ever seen in the history  of movies.

This movie gets a lot of hate but when you boil it down it's basically a lighter version of Wreck-it Ralph. The plot twists were pretty good but the comedy was a bit childish for me (that's the point). Fairly average.

It at least has a heart followed by a sent thumbs-up emoji.
