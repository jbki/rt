Naturally me and my 13 year old friends start screaming to put on the emoji movie and we win to others disgust. We watch and whenever we find a joke that can be made dirty, the little perverts that we are make fun of it. One is \"What could a 13 year old BOY possibly want to hide from his parents\" and one that really got us going is \"Put some sauce on that dance burrito\". Even the assistant was laughing and it is now a joke.
