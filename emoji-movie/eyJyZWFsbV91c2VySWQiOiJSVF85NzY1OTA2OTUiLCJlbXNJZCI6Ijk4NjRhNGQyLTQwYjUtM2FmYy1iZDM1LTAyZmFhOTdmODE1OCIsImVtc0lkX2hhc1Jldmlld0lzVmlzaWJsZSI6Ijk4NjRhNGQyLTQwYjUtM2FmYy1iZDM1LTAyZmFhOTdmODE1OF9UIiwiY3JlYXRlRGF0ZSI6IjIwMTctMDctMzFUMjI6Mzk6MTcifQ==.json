The jokes are amazing. The graphics were good, ran 120 FPS with no lag or ping spikes, the controls were very clean as well. Reminds me of my favorite movie, Knack.

It may not be a masterpiece, but it's far, far from the worst film in existence. Some of the jokes felt a bit forced and some definitely worth an eye roll, but I found the movie quite enjoyable. Some weak points include not following through on the original metaphor (being gay and in the closet) as well as a very forced romantic sub-plot, bu the animation's pleasant to watch, there was a positive message at the end, and the overall story was relatively engaging. From my own personal interest, I give the movie 8/10. From my objective artist's perspective, I rate 6/10. I rate 5/5 here because there shouldn't be this much cheap negativity such a genuinely harmless movie.","displayName":"Henry B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-31T20:57:33.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-31T21:19:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"976590514","realm":"RT","displayName":"Henry B","accountLink":"/user/id/976590514"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 31, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie ever made no movie ever made by DC can compare \nDC should learn from the  emoji movie.\nEmoji movie a true master piece !","displayName":"Annisha V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-31T20:57:26.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-31T20:57:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"975068360","realm":"RT","displayName":"Annisha V","accountLink":"/user/id/975068360"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 31, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is amazing, is better than any marvel films that has ever been released.
