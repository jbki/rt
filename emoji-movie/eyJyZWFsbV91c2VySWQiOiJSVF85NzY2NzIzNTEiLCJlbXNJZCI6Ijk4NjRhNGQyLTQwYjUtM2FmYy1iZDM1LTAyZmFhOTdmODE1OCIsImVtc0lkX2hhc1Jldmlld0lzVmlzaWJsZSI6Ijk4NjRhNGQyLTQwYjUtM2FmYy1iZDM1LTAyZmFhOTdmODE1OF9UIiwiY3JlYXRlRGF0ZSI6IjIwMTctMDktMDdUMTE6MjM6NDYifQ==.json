But at age 6 and 3, they pretty much like anything that is a new cartoon. The main difference I have seen between my kids reaction to the movie, is that they didnt ask for a thousand different toys from the movie. I took them to go see Cars 3, and the after time with them was more expensive than the actual movie. Somehow they suckered me into buying a toy for each of them. Both cost more than their tickets. And the purchased didnt stop. Have two parents living away from each other. It is hard to coordinate if one of us buys them toys. Oh shit, I just realize that they are in order to get more toys, but they have yet to ask for an emoji poop, princess, or the meh one. \n\nSo...for kids, it is perfect. \nFor parents: blah...time to catch up on some much needed sleep.\nFor the wallet: Few toys, and the toys that are available arent really cool. So you might save a few bucks...","displayName":"Chris B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/872910124/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-09-05T04:25:51.000Z","updateDate":"2017-09-05T04:25:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"786090616","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris B","accountLink":"/user/id/786090616"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 05, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie made me go limp.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-09-05T04:22:11.000Z","updateDate":"2017-09-05T04:22:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"976587239","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976587239"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 05, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This film was disappointing. It is great for any child under 3 because they can not differentiate between a good movie and a poor one. Although I will not be showing tgis to my child as i wouldnt rot her brain with such overpopulated drivel. A perfect example of the 60 percent of films that are made each year that should have gone straight to DVD.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/853946898087976/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-09-05T03:01:02.000Z","updateDate":"2017-09-05T03:09:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"976667836","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976667836"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 05, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This is the worst movie I ever seen! The story were poorly written, The character were poorly development which none of them are likeable and I couldn't feel any connection each other especially jailbreak which is ripoff from Lego Movie, joke is almost unfunny, and this movie was a ripoff from Wreck-it Ralph and Inside Out. The only positive I got is the animation, but it doesn't matter whatever is the good or bad animation. What does matter is the story and character. If both of them are bad then that consider the bad movie. At the end of the movie, my face turned into the meh face and I said..........(deep low voice) \"What the heck did I just watch?\" I thought I can prove the critic that this movie can't be that bad, but I was wrong. I watch the movie for free on my phone and I'm happy that I saved some money. This movie was boring and mindless. I did not laugh once. The moral of this story is the most important thing about this phone is the emoji. Wrong, the emojis are not that important. Now to be fair, I sometime use the emoji to understand how I'm feelings. However, the words are stronger than the emoji. The words can get their feelings better or hurt even more than the emoji. This is the one of the main reason why this movie should never exist. If you're going to make the movie then tell us why you're making it. because if you don't, then that not a good sign. The reason why I watch it because I watch for you, my family, friends, and kids so they don't have to watch that movie. DO NOT BUY THE DVD MOVIE, DO NOT WATCH ON THEATER, AND DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT WATCH IT. Save the money and watch recommended movie like Zootopia, Wreck It Ralph, Inside Out, etc.","displayName":"Jake P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-09-04T16:45:31.000Z","updateDate":"2017-09-04T17:25:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"976667013","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jake P","accountLink":"/user/id/976667013"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 04, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Who came with that idea?!
