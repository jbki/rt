It is one of the most underrated animated films of our generation. Honestly if this does not win an Oscar then there is a serious problem with Hollywood. All the people hating on this film don't know the first thing about animated film making. Patrick Stewart as the poo emoji is hilarious, why can't people see how funny this is. Tj Miller delivers a layered performance as Gene, the animation is super slick and the theme of the movie is just what we need in a post-truth Donald Trump era. Parents need to take there kids to this film to understand how their children communicate. Stop hating on this film.","displayName":"Robert C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-13T15:34:58.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-13T15:38:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"976621997","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert C","accountLink":"/user/id/976621997"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 13, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Pretty horrible.

Nothing about this movie works. There are so many plot holes and the entire script was stolen from other better movies that actually worked! It feels like Sony can't decide if they love emojis or if they hate people who use them. They make jokes about millennial having short attention spans.
