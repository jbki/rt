If and when the sequel is announced I will update to the 5th and final star. What is there to say about the emojie movie other than that it is our generations \"Schindler's List .\" The movie had so much depth beyond the surface that one watch will not suffice. I have watched the Emoji movie with my kids, grandkids, and even my pets! I feel like the film gets a bad rep but I think this is due to the fact that people have only seen it once. When watching a Guillermo Del Toro film you need atleast 3 watches to get the fully meaning. I can not recommend this enough and if you have any questions feel free to follow me on facebook. Thank you for your time and I hope you too enjoy the emoji move! :)","displayName":"Kurt R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1803068904/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-02-08T20:31:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-02-08T20:36:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"970372453","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kurt R","accountLink":"/user/id/970372453"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"How about this for a movie:  you spend nearly the entirety of it in a smart phone where the plot makes very little sense,  complete with the most obnoxious jokes that probably won't even make its target audience laugh.What?! No, that's already a horrible idea, that you should just scrap to shreds! Think of something else. Anything else! Try telling that  to the makers of the Emoji Movie. I think its ratings speak for themselves: this movie is not good. It seemingly made a huge blunder on every possible element it could have. Bad story? Check! Incoherence? Check! And my personal favorite: Terrible manifestation of forced feminism? Check! That's not to say that I don't agree with feminist movements, by the way. What I'm saying is that the movie itself incorporated it in a way the audience didn't appreciate.\n \nThis effectively rendered the movie mediocre at best, and pretty f*cking terrible at worst.\n\nBut if you can find it for cheap, (as in basically free) I really recommend that you pick it up, especially if you're into movie design. Why? Because, in short, it'll tell you what not to make in a movie.","displayName":"Hayden F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-02-07T19:46:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-02-07T20:30:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"977097569","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hayden F","accountLink":"/user/id/977097569"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 07, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie was way worse than I expected. It's aimed squarely at the brain-dead, phone obsessed tween/teen demographic. It ruins apps, it ruins songs I used to like, and it ruins phones in general. Not a single person involved from the animators (The characters all look horrendous), to the writers (fuck you Tony Leondis, Eric Siegel, and Mike White, Go dig a hole and dive into it), to the director (also Tony Leondis. Fuck you twice), to the cast  seem invested in the product they are working on. If The Lego Movie is the example of how to do a film like this correctly, then The Emoji Movie is the antithesis. It attempts to shoe-horn in messages about non-comfority and feminism (none of which feel sincere or earned). It also posits that the only proper way to show your emotions (or express your love for a girl) is by texting emojis.  It's soulless, unfunny, bland, boring, uninspired and just plain awful. My only emotions throughout the film were meh (appropriately enough), anger, and  boredom. The Emoji Movie perfectly captures everything that is wrong with today's youth. It wll make you want to chuck your phone in the trash can, or maybe smash it with a hammer.","displayName":"Dan H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-02-07T08:37:48.000Z","updateDate":"2018-02-07T09:04:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"906180249","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dan H","accountLink":"/user/id/906180249"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 07, 2018"}]}
