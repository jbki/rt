This new one, set 30 years after the events of \"Stitch 2: Stitch has a glitch\" is funny, touching, and surprisingly light-footed. It boasts a lot of familiar elements, including Emoji family mythology and another Death Star-type weapon, as well as self-aware lines about how things work in this series.","displayName":"Theodore%20 F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T14:08:52.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T14:17:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"976578808","realm":"RT","displayName":"Theodore%20 F","accountLink":"/user/id/976578808"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"True physical enlightenment comes in the form of The Emoji Movie.
