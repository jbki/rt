And it takes the best element of them.\nIn its core, The Emoji Move (EM) represents \"Sausage Party\" for younger audience, with the original \"Toy Story\" dark style. That's how good chasing scenes in it.\nWriting/Plot is steep and boring, but at the same time keeps viewer on the point for entire movie.\nFiller material utilized marvelously. It doesn't drives all your attention to it and it respects viewers' effort to take a look. You will never see anything offensive in a frame like a bare bottom, breasts, saliva or urine.\nJokes/visual gags and visuals overall are fairly innocent and pristine in this movie.\nI would reccomend my child to see this movie if only they are not afraid of cartoonish genocide and imminent 'wipeout'.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/694859777366396/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-11T09:15:40.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-11T09:59:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"976616115","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976616115"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 11, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I liked this movie even though the critic don't.
