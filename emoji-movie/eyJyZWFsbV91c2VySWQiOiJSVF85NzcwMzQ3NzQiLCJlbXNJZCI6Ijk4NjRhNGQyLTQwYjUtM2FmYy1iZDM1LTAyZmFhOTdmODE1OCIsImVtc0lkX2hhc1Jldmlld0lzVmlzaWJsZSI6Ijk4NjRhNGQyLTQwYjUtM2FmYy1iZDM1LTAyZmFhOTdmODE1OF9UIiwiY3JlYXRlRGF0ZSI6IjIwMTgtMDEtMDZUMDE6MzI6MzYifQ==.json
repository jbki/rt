It was a good movie, cheesy but good.  Bunch of pretentious duchebags reviewing a movie they hated because they can't stick with the movies they like.  Best stay away from cars and trolls and Moana and shrek... etc etc. All I got from the hate is you don't like kids movies.","displayName":"Aaron K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-01-04T16:39:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-01-04T16:44:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"976098608","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aaron K","accountLink":"/user/id/976098608"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 04, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"I think most negative reviews are a bit harsh. Considering it in context... the title tells you what it's about, so let's immediately lower expectations - this is going to be pop culture trash, not a cerebral experience full of rich complexity. So in that context it's not too bad. Lame in parts, sure, but overall not a bad story with a scattering of laughs... if you were asked to make a movie about emoji, which we surely all agree is a ridiculous request.
