The subtle referencing and allusion combined with the first class animation from Sony Pictures Animation ??combine for one of the best viewing experiences of my life. ??\n   Tony Leonids brings us a true candidate for picture of the year. ??Accompanied by an excellent soundtrack provided by Patrick Doyle ??the atmosphere of this masterpiece outclasses other current movies like Dunkirk?? or Spider-Man: Homecoming??. I never thought I would witness another movie on par with The Boss Baby????, but Leonids proved me wrong.\n    Though I initially questioned it I can see why T.J. Miller?? quit Silicon Valley?? to focus on The Emoji Movie. Both James Corden??? and Maya Rudolph???? are both perfectly cast as well. Sir Patrick Stewart??

However, my children want it to watch it so we went for it. I don't regret watching this movie. It has lots of hidden adult humor. I don't get the critics. I'm going to have to lay out the \"How to get good reviews on your movie starter kit\".\n1. Don't diss social media. This happened to the Movie the Circle too. Once you mess with people's dear social media you are likely to get a bad review.\n2. Include non-hetero romance. More amd more I see that movies with same sex romance get the best reviews.\n3. Don't persuade women audience to think big and that they can be anything they want to be on life.\n4. Don't persuade kids to be themselves.\n\nExcuse my grammar but didn't feel like using spell check or grammar check.","displayName":"Jose G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-02T20:49:19.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-02T20:57:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"976595252","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jose G","accountLink":"/user/id/976595252"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 02, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Is the emoji movie a good movie? The answer is an unequivocal no. The writing is concept is terrible, and it's all in all terrible. But is is fun to watch? Dear god, yes. The movie is a nonstop thrill ride of \"did they really do that?\"s and \"this is terrible and hilarious\". Watch it with friends. Whisper jokes into each other's ear. You will have the time of your life, and I think that may be the Emoji Movie's ultimate redeeming quality. It's terrible, but it's so overwhelmingly fun that not giving it five stars feels like a disservice.","displayName":"Emma R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-02T19:44:22.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-02T19:48:11.000Z","user":{"userId":"976595118","realm":"RT","displayName":"Emma R","accountLink":"/user/id/976595118"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 02, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"It is a real adventure but god it's still awful\nOh and guess what?
