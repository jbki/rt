This is just another example of companies coming up with a lazy plot about something that is popular amongst our generation so that people say \"oh I use emojis I should go see that\". The one thing they got right about this movie is casting the most boring actor in hollywood to play a character that's supposed to be boring. Everything about this movie is so lazy by the studio. The plot had no thought process what so ever, the characters were every under developed, and the jokes were just plain cringy and tough to sit through. This movie never should've been made and I think most people agree and know that. The best and most critically acclaimed actor in this film, Patrick Stewart, is literally playing a piece of poop, waste of potential right there. I practically fell asleep with every scene of \"meh's\" parents they were so boring. So overall I think this movie was just a huge ad advertising emojis and just dance and candy crush etc... Normally I would say for a bad kids movie that it would be okay to take the kids to and that they would laugh and enjoy it and it would teach them a good lesson, but the message of this movie is to text more so I wouldn't even say that. I don't think anybody will get enjoyment from this movie and there is no good themes to teach kids at all. Overall this movie is not enjoyable and was a pain to sit through every 10 seconds was a new cringy moment. Who knows maybe a few of you out there got enjoyment from this movie somehow but personally I can't see that being possible.","displayName":"Riley N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-01-16T16:52:57.000Z","updateDate":"2018-01-16T17:06:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"977010211","realm":"RT","displayName":"Riley N","accountLink":"/user/id/977010211"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"loved it still dreaming about a seconbd one","displayName":"Jew i","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-01-16T06:00:00.000Z","updateDate":"2018-01-16T06:00:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"977056923","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jew i","accountLink":"/user/id/977056923"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"0/5.

Genes goal is to escape the phone and get to the cloud. This represents the eternal struggle of humanity to create peace and order while we are forced to live in chaos. Furthermore, the three main characters (Gene, Jailbreak, and Hi-5) represent the three Freudian concepts of the mind. Hi-5 respresents the id. Always searching for instant gratification. Gene represents the super-ego, trying to do the morally right thing all the time. Finally, Jailbreak respresents the ego, trying to forever satisfy both parties.","displayName":"Rob K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-01-13T23:36:06.000Z","updateDate":"2018-01-13T23:52:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"977052368","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rob K","accountLink":"/user/id/977052368"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Not completely horrible, just meh.","displayName":"J W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-01-13T20:59:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-01-13T21:00:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"977052197","realm":"RT","displayName":"J W","accountLink":"/user/id/977052197"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This represents and features everything bad about Hollywood nowadays.\nCynical Commercialism.","displayName":"Steffen F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-01-12T15:44:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-01-12T15:44:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"921280795","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steffen F","accountLink":"/user/id/921280795"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This film is awfully: animated, voice acted, and written","displayName":"Stinky P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-01-12T09:04:15.000Z","updateDate":"2018-01-12T09:06:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"977048748","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stinky P","accountLink":"/user/id/977048748"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"I liked it but it was not my type of movie","displayName":"LylaJoy R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-01-11T19:54:04.000Z","updateDate":"2018-01-11T19:54:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"977047834","realm":"RT","displayName":"LylaJoy R","accountLink":"/user/id/977047834"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 11, 2018"}]}
