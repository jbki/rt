Well, this movie is like an 80 minute version of those ads, except unlike those ads, the emoji movie is never at any point interesting. In addition, the movie was so cringy I got up to go to the bathroom, not because I needed to, but because Ineeded a break from this  terrible \"film\" I don't even want to call it a film really, it's just a bunch of app ads.","displayName":"Nate R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-31T20:01:21.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-31T20:04:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"976658408","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nate R","accountLink":"/user/id/976658408"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 31, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"stupid movie. kids giggle a little bit but not much to it. pixar movies are really going downhill.

The ?film? was basically a f*** fest of ads for a verity of apps and programs. Further more the film demonstrates the exact opposite of individuality (which is the films exact ?message?) by displaying ads. As a comedy animation for children one would expect so funny jokes. But instead the Emoji Movie spits out forced puns that most children wouldn't get.\n\nSo to conclude this review I would say that this film isn?t even worth watching ironically. I hope all who contributed to the movie feel ashamed at what they have done \nI rate 0.5/5 stars","displayName":"Sholn T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-31T06:54:17.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-31T06:57:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"976657317","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sholn T","accountLink":"/user/id/976657317"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 31, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"??I Thought The Emoji Was gr8 I Love It.
