For the content and premise, I thought it was cute and amusing enough for an adult. I mean, should we expect every 1 1/2 hour movie produced to be a blockbuster? Very, very few adult movies are worth the cost, so why should kids movies be \"amazing\"? I see pretty much every kids movie that comes out with my twins and their friends, so at least there I feel pretty educated on what is terrible and what is not so bad. I'll put this one in the \"won't buy the cd but a good Sunday afternoon get-a-Way\".","displayName":"Jaime M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T11:33:19.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T11:36:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"918390117","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jaime M","accountLink":"/user/id/918390117"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie was a BLAST.
