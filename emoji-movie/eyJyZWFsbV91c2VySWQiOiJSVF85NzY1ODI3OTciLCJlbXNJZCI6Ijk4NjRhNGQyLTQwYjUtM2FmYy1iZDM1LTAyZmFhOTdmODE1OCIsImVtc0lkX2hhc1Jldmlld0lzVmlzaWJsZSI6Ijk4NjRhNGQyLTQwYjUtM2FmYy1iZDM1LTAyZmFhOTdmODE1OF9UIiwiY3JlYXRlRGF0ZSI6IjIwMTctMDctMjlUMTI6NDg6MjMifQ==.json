It doesnt awnser these questions directly it makes them very clear that it cant but that it you should find the awnsers yourself. in summary if you want to see a smart animated movie that asks important questions and provides an awareness of the consumer culture it exists in.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/504597666550468/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T12:26:08.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T12:35:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"976582721","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976582721"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Imagine having the opportunity to see the premiere of Star Wars back when it first came out. You now have that opportunity. The emoji movie is a masterpiece of filmmaking. It crosses all genres, having moments of intense suspense, and some hilarious laughs. There is also a love story for the ages. One so powerful that not even Shakespeare would have been able to properly write about. This movie IS perfect. The only thing that disappointed me about this film was that I will never get to see it again for the first time. I would give 6 stars if I could.","displayName":"Lord M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T12:21:57.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T12:28:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"976582711","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lord M","accountLink":"/user/id/976582711"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"10/10 would see again","displayName":"Bob D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T12:16:03.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T12:16:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"976582693","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bob D","accountLink":"/user/id/976582693"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"please don't see it ironically. it's not bad enough to be funny, it's just painful.
