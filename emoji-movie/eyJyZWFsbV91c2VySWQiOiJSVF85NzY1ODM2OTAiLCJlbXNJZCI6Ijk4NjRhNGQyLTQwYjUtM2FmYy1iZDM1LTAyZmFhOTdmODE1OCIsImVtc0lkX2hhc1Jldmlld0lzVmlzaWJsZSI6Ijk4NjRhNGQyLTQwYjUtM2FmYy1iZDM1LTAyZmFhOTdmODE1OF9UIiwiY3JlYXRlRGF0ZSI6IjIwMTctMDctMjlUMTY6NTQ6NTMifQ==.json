People say this is bad because \"oh they ripped of another movie\" or \"oh its a desperate attempt to appeal to a younger audience\". The reason I gave it 4.5 stars because, in the phone when someone is using an emoji, that emoji has to make a facial expression. but the best part of it was the message, but people don't see it because they're to busy criticizing it. The message really imposes good morals on our youth. People from the 90s knew about cartoons that impose good morals, and they know that nowadays, we don't have that anymore. The movie really teaches acceptance, in other words, the movie teaches, people are different, and differences make us who we are. You might be saying \"the emojis are different\"  they are different on the outside, but deep in their roots, they're all the same. I don't know if the people who made this movie to have it have this message, but... does it matter anyways?","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/485799998448393/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T16:33:07.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T16:59:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"976583619","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976583619"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"the emoji movie is a generic uninspired \"film\"  packed with predictable and uninspired jokes.
