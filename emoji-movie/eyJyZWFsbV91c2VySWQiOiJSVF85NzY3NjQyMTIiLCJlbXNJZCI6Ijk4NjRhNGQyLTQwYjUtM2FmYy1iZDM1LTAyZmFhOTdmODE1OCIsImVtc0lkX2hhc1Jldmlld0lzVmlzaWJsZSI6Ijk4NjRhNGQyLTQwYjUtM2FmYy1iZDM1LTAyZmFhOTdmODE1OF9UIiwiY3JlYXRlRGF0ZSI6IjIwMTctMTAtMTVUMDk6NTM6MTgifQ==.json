From a kids standpoint, it was great and very entertaining. Even for an adult it was hilarious. People need to learn to lighten up and not get \"offended\" for every little thing. The horrible ratings on this movie are retarded, this movie was very similar to Wreck it Ralph,highly enjoyable. Great movie, plan on buying it! \nMy kids give it 5 stars ??????????","displayName":"Britanny R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-14T21:49:24.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-14T21:55:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"932438244","realm":"RT","displayName":"Britanny R","accountLink":"/user/id/932438244"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 14, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Don't watch to movie, unwatchable, disgusting.\n\nIt's about a MEH that's gets picked and has to be taken seriously, I mean what?

The concept of the emojis entering candy crush and dance dance revolution is funny enough when you bypass the ads for the games and even the concept of the emojis having their own world and requirements. If you want something to put on for an hour in the background to entertain people passing buy then this movie is for you but if not and you want something you can invest yourself in then pass it on by","displayName":"Edwin H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-14T20:44:28.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-14T20:52:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"976762777","realm":"RT","displayName":"Edwin H","accountLink":"/user/id/976762777"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 14, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie is horrible in so many ways, first of all its really predictable and they copied wreck it Ralph and I think frozen!","displayName":"Lotus G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-14T20:01:04.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-14T20:01:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"976130022","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lotus G","accountLink":"/user/id/976130022"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 14, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Worst movie I have ever watched.
