The movie starts out nicely paced, but when things speed up it just turns into a mess. The movie is mostly cliché from beginning to end, notice I said \"mostly\" because every time it tries by anything else it fails like, BIG time. The movie is very fast and just completely rushes the characters relationships, though to be fair it is a short movie but they could have certainly found a way. The voice acting is well, meh. There is one scene in which HI-5 just smiles in the end while the actor for him ( James Corden )\nTalks and cheers and of course they don't align with each other. Another big gripe I realized I had with this movie as I watched it is that to the drop box they were going too is next to the Just Dance app and they have too dance there way out of there...\n\nWHY?! Can't you just walk by that app and go to drop box? They spend there time there for 10 minutes, maybe I missed something but if that's the case, good gosh. The movie has a massive amount of product placement just for money. As bad as this movie is, there is one thing that went unnoticed by many that I thought was quite good, the ways they made sort of things in the movie that were part of a phone were quite creativity designed and I saw some talent in that. That's all I thought about the emoji movie, bad? Yes. Worst movie of all time? No, it's certainly not as bad as some people say on the internet, but then again that's the internet.","displayName":"mmiles","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-02T13:42:25.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-08T10:04:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"976503288","realm":"RT","displayName":"mmiles","accountLink":"/user/id/976503288"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 02, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The Emoji Movie is so meh and boring for even a kids animated film and serves as an advertisement for texting with emojis and phone games.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-02T12:30:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-01-22T14:48:04.446Z","user":{"userId":"955370067","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/955370067"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 02, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Yo!

Even though there's no Original World like Wreck-It Ralph \n\nI'm grasping at straws\n\nThe Bad (My Fucking God)\nThe Creepy Exercise on Product Placement\nThe likes of Facebook, YouTube, Crackle and Instagram are briefly seen or name-dropped, while services and games such as Dropbox, Candy Crush, Just Dance, Spotify and Twitter are actual, honest-to-God plot points as multi-expressive emoji Gene (T.J. Miller) tries to figure out exactly what he wants to be. Its basically for kids to go ooooohh its that app, its disgusting.\n\nA Talented Cast Wasted\nAlongside the brilliant T.J. Miller, the movie stars James Corden, Anna Faris, Maya Rudolph, Steven Wright, Jennifer Coolidge, Patrick Stewart (but more on him later), Christina Aguilera, SofÃ­a Vergara, Sean Hayes, Jeff Ross and Rob Riggle.\n\nOnly James Corden really gives a particularly energetic performance, but again, he's working with nothing, so it's basically for naught.\n\nThis is not Funny like at All - From first minute to last, the script takes the easiest, laziest route possible with its humour, opting for low-effort puns and eye-rolling smartphone-related gags.\nWhether you're a kid or an adult, the movie's attempts at humour fall fatally flat, and if you manage to smirk or half-smile just a few times throughout its run-time, that's frankly a bit of a miracle.\n\nThe Animation is Fucking Lazy like my brother could fucking make a better art style of animation and he's 15, but its Sony Picture Animation who are lazy except for Cloudy For a Chance of Meatballs.\n\nSir Patrick Stewert's Shit Emoji is barely in it and his Shit Jokes are Lazy and easy as fuck even the lazy Star Trek Reference. \n\nIt Throws Away Most Of Its Satirical Potential\n\nThe Awful Meh Parents Sub Plot which almost led to a divorce cause the Dad was to Meh to care (LIKE WHY IS THIS A THING)\n\nDROPBOX FUCKING DROPBOX Is a plot point\n\nThe Most Cringe Worthy (and there's a lot of cringeworthy scenes) scene is the ending which is a AWFUL DANCE NUMBER called The Emoji Pop that came from Just Dance App.......\n\nMaya Rudolph as Smiler the BIGGEST ANNOYING CHARACTER OF THE WHOLE MOTHER FUCKING MOVIE, and I love Maya Rudolph but I hated her for a whole Hour and a Half\n\nIt felt too fucking long\n\nChristina Algerera Jesus Christ \n\nYouTube app showed only the shittiest videos on Youtube.\n\nCandy Crush enough said\n\nThey went to the piracy world and had viruses, trojan horse but couldn't show porn cause its a kids movie.\n\nThey used Twitter as a way to get back home..............\n\nI'm surprised Snapchat wasn't on this but it made me hate Spotify for a moment \n\nThe Biggest thing its a Rip Off of Wreck-It Ralph, Inside Out and The Lego Movie.\n\nOverall: The Biggest Fucking Cash Grab of 2017 and possibly Worst Movie of the Year \n\nOverall Grade: This truly deserves the \"Fuck You\" Rating","displayName":"Jacob M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-06-30T21:09:00.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-04T18:26:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"931316257","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jacob M","accountLink":"/user/id/931316257"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I think it's awesome","displayName":"Sam B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-06-30T08:26:45.000Z","updateDate":"2017-06-30T08:27:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"976496144","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sam B","accountLink":"/user/id/976496144"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 30, 2017"}]}
