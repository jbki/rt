What I saw of this \"product\" (I am afraid to call it a movie) is incredibly boring and insulting at the same time, and I wish death among every person that worked on this piece of emoji garbage. I only saw half of it though, because this movie made me so bored and insulted, I started masturbating to make myself feel a bit better. Thankfully i was removed from the theater. \n\n     Don't see this film. Even if you're one of this faggot kids that see the movie ironically, please don't watch it. You are supporting the film if you do so. If you saw it already, I think that the best suggestion for you is suicide.","displayName":"Evan C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-05T19:03:12.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-05T19:03:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"974648295","realm":"RT","displayName":"Evan C","accountLink":"/user/id/974648295"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 05, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Movie of the history of the universe.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/368179236934526/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-05T18:25:04.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-05T18:26:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"976603151","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976603151"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 05, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Make no mistake, the emoji movie is a very, very VERY bad movie( we're talking about a hyperactive piece of corporate propaganda where Spotify saves the world and sir Patrick Stewart voices a walking pile of shit) but real life is just to hard to compete with right now. It is a soul crushing disaster that lacks humor, wit, compelling preformences, and countless other things that would make this a good movie. Gets any rating at all because at least the animation was ok.","displayName":"Paul B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-05T18:17:19.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-05T18:22:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"976603130","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paul B","accountLink":"/user/id/976603130"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 05, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I took my 8 year old son to see this movie and we had fun. It's a clever story about a \"Meh\" รฐ??? emoji that wanted to be more. Nothing more politically radical than that, which is why I believe more of the radical leftist critics on rotten tomatoes didn't like it. We enjoyed seeing the characters traverse through the mobile app universe and encounter apps like Candy Crush,  Just Dance, Dropbox, and Instagram. It didn't feel like an unabashed capitalist opportunist advertising as some have accused. The humor of casting Steven Wright as Gene's dad was not lost on a 40 something like me. I only gave it 3 1/2 stars because I wish there was more of the emoji characters developed in the story but overall it was a fun movie to see as a family.","displayName":"Chad M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-05T18:12:41.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-05T18:12:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"957876334","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chad M","accountLink":"/user/id/957876334"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 05, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The kids loved it!

I saw this with the lowest of expectations and kept waiting for moments that led other reviewers to call this movie \"offensive\", or one that leaves a viewer \"a colder person, not only angry at the film for being unconscionably bad, but resentful of it for making them feel angry.\"; and \"a movie for no one.\" There may not be many laughs but there are genuine ones, and I don't recall attempts at humor that fell flat.  It was not great, not bad, but enjoyable. There is one scene (in virtual Paris) that comes off very well and made me wish we could see it in 3D.  I suspect the fact that the movie has product placement and that they refused to let critics publish before it was released may have led to the unwarranted backlash.  I've read several of the reviews and have not seen one that actually articulates a fair and reasoned objection to the movie.  I'm not saying it's a must see, but don't let the negative reviews keep you from seeing it.","displayName":"Robert G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10155433481228348/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-05T17:26:15.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-05T17:34:13.000Z","user":{"userId":"976516886","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robert G","accountLink":"/user/id/976516886"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 05, 2017"}]}
