It has a realistic theme, but is animated in such a way where you forget of the theme of realism. The story arc is great but I find it a little too cliche for my tastes. But its all forgiven because of the main characters, there is so many different kinds of different personalities. Overall its a great movie, and I greatly recommend seeing it!","displayName":"Turnip K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-08T20:36:34.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-08T20:43:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"976611053","realm":"RT","displayName":"Turnip K","accountLink":"/user/id/976611053"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 08, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The 3 words that describe this movie are boring, unwatchable and even more boring.
