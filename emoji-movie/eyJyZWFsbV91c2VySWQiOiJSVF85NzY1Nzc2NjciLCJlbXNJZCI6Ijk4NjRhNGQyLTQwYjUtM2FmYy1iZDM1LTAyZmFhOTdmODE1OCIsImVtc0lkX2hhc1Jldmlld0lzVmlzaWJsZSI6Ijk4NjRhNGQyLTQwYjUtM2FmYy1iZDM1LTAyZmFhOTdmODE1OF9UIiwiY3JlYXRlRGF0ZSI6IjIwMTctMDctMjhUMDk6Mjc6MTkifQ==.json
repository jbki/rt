Where to even begin?\nIt's a barebones recycled kids movie story with some of the worst tropes and cliches I've ever seen (Jailbreak is touted as being super feminist but it's all false to get more seats filled), I doubt any of the screenwriters on this have ever actually USED an emoji in real life. If you find the poop emoji funny then...you'll probably like this. That's a really low bar though. And the poop emoji has 5 lines despite being in all the marketing. There's good talent like James Corden in the movie who clearly don't know what animation is like and thought this would be their big break into the animated world. Mel Meh is the most bland, generic character with no personality I've ever seen (despite the whole movie being about how he has ALL the personalities he's a jack of all trades, master of none). \n\nThe worst part is how malicious the advertising is. Twitter, Soundcloud, Dropbox, Spotify, Candy Crush, Just Dance etc, it's one big ploy to get your kids to mindlessly use their phones with several minutes dedicated to trying to sell you the apps like an advert. It is harmful to your kids and malicious because of it.\n\nUltimately this is a movie that preys on the gullible, the people who will get enjoyment out of pointing at something and going \"I know what that is!!!\". Don't see this movie, not even ironically, it's just not worth giving them the money for your ticket.","displayName":"T H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T09:09:43.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T11:06:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"975726905","realm":"RT","displayName":"T H","accountLink":"/user/id/975726905"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"}]}
