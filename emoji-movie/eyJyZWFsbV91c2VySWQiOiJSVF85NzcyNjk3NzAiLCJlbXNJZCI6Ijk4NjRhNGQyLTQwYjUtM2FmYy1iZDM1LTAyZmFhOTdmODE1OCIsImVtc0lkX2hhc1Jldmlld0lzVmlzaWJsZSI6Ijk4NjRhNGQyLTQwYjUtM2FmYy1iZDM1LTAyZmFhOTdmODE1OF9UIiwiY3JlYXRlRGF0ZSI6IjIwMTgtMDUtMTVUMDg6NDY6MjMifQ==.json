Everything, the art, the plot, the character development, the theme, it was anything, but \"meh.\" My children so did my wife (in fact that was the only reason that I took them to this movie). I thought, hey, at least it will keep the kids from screaming the next time we go to Dennis! So, I walked into the movie theater, unsuspecting of what awaited me and my household. I came out with a teary face and a wobbly body, I was indeed not ready for this film. The action scenes where just so intense and vibrant, to the point where even Marvel would be scared. \nIs this the worst movie ever?\nno\nIs this the best movie ever?\ny  e  s","displayName":"Angel%20 R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-12T19:13:12.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-12T19:21:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"977266385","realm":"RT","displayName":"Angel%20 R","accountLink":"/user/id/977266385"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I was really excited for the movie but not too much so, so I watched it on Netflix. It started out pretty good but just a few minutes in I found that I had a lot of questions about the society and the main character. I tried to ignore it and just continue on with the movie and I waited for a climax, or just something interesting... that part never came. I guess the creators tried to make it a movie with multiple climaxes but they did it so much that the whole movie felt bland. I started to fall asleep during it. There are so many things wrong with this movie how the logic doesn't make sense, to the obvious and lame guest star appearances, to the even more obvious Candy Crush advertising, and the whole movie was just boring. The idea is pretty good but the creators and writers must have been in a time crunch. The Emoji Movie is a perfect example of Hollywood out of ideas so they do movies fast so they can get money fast, which ultimately leads to poor quality.","displayName":"Lillian W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-11T07:31:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-11T07:40:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"977223193","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lillian W","accountLink":"/user/id/977223193"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I just love it.

Now onto the \"movie\": As expected, it was just a cess-pool of cliches and unfunny dad-jokes; I probably shouldn't say that because the jokes in this movie are even worse. This movie had very little character development, characters interacted with one another very unrealistically. For example: Jailbreak, who is just your typical cliche non-conformist, and Gene, an average and uninteresting character who's just another cliche, become friends within one day. In my opinion, I don't about yours, that's pretty unrealistic. To whomever decides that this movie deserves a go: I wish you luck.","displayName":"Awkward P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-09T13:42:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-09T13:56:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"977262777","realm":"RT","displayName":"Awkward P","accountLink":"/user/id/977262777"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"It is not the worst movie ever, it has good animation and ok voice acting.\nnow wfor my real freview\n\nGENE IS THICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC","displayName":"Jake P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-08T14:01:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-11-07T11:00:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"977261808","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jake P","accountLink":"/user/id/977261808"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A truly marvelous movie with the most astounding humor, soundtrack, characters and plot!
