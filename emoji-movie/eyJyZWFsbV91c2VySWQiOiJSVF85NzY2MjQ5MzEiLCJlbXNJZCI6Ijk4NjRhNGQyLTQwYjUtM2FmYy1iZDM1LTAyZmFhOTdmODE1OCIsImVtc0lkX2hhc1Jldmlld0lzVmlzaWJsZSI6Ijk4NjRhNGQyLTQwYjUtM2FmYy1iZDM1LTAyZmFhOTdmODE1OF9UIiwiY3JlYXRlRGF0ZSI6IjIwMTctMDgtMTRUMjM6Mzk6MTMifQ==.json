The animation and the world they've created is pretty, hence the half star, but it lacks everything that makes children's films enjoyable. The plot was predictable, and that would have been forgivable if the script was well written but it isn't. Product placement is rife, and the love interest ending came out of nowhere. \nThere's usually adult humour dotted about these films making it copable for parents who've had to sit through it but when it missed humour full stop maybe I was expecting too much?","displayName":"Zoe J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/514747265/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-14T22:01:38.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-14T22:08:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"849628164","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zoe J","accountLink":"/user/id/849628164"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 14, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"this movie looked cute, but it was very boring and the jokes were dry.\nmy kids wanted to leave the theater 40 min into it.","displayName":"Brock H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-14T21:55:29.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-14T22:05:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"949127519","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brock H","accountLink":"/user/id/949127519"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 14, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie, loved it ????!

And tbh, I was hoping this would go better than it did. And after watching (not in theaters, cause I didn't wanna pay full price) I have to agree with the others. It's a clever a really good idea that fell flat.\n\nIt did fell pretty rushed and cramped with only 86 mins of screen time, but I mean, what can you expect? Also, I think the love interest between Gene and Jailbreak/princess was pretty forced. It didn't have a whole lot of development.. \n\nHowever, there were a few (and what I mean is like 2-3) funny parts that I actually LAUGHED (not giggled) at. And there were a few parts that made me giggle. I did also REALLY enjoy all the references to apps, popular web videos, etc. since I am (still) growing up in this generation. So I get 98% of the references.\n\nI also love the mom of Gene (main character), and just the Meh emojis in general, because they're so lackadaisical in their emotions and feelings. I couldn't just help but laugh, because I can relate to that sometimes.. \n\nAnd the cast they hired did a good job voicing each character too. \n\nBut to be fair, those few little things did not match up to the rest of the movies' pretty under-developed storyline, poor lack of character development, etc. I personally believe if they had cut out the love interest and perhaps made the movie run for at least 15-20 minutes longer, and developing Smiler, Gene, Hi-5, and Jailbreak a little more, I could see this movie being a whole lot better!!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-14T20:46:37.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-14T20:46:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"976615089","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976615089"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 14, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Such a good movie!
