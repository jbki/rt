The Emoji Movie doesn't get a check in any of the above listed categories, and in none other that come to my mind (granted, not many can come to my mind, now that this movie has given me stage four brain cancer). Don't waste your money on this film. If you can't tell how bad the movie will be based off of this title alone, I'm sorry.\n\nI did like the colors they used in the film.
