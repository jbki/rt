Truly it shouldn't be one of the last thing she you experience in you're life. After you've experienced something so beautiful everything else in life will feel meaningless. Absolutely nothing comes close to the feeling you get when you watch this movie, not marriage, not intercourse, not even having a child. Truly this experience has caused me to peak at a young age, and I don't think life is worth living anymore, but it's all worth it because I know that I got to experience this. We live in a 13 trillion year old universe, on a 5 Billion year old chunk of rock flying around in space in the perfect location to harbor life, life evolved for 3 Billion years and humanity has been around for 2 million, and I am lucky enough to be one of the few things alive in all of existence that will be able to experience this movie.

I personally thought that it'll just run fir a short period of time and I didn't think that it will be THAT bad. But, I was WRONG! \n\nHow do you even call this piece of that *poop emoji* a movie!? It has no likeable characters, an unoriginal story, bad animation, jokes that 3 year old kids WOULDN'T EVEN LAUGH at them, an overrated massage that wasn't deliverd in a creative way but it's shoved down to your throat, dumb advertisments, and the worst of them all is that this \"movie\" could take a place instead of an actual great movie! (For example, not everyone got to see Kubo and the two strings, but Norm of the north had a WORLDWIDE RELEASE. Do you realize how stupid is that?)\n\nIn short: I don't recommend this film to enyone, kids deserve movies better than this, nobody asked for it and it's entire existence is just cashing in from 5 year old kids that don't know eny better.\n\nI'm sometimes ashamed of the world that we live in.\nScore: 0.5/5","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1925982124341249/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T14:40:28.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T14:59:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"976578972","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976578972"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"}]}
