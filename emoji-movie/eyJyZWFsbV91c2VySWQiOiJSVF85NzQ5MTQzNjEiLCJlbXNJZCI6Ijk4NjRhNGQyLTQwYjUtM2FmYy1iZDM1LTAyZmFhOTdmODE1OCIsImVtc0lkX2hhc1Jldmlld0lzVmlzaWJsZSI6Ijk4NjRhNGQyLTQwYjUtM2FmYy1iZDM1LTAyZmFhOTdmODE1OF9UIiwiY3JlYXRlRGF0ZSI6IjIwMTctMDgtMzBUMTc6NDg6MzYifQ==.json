Doesnt really make sense...something about a meh emoji getting selected but makes a mistake and is hunted down to be deleted. Still may appeal to those who have their heads down stuck in their phone wondering if their little apps and smiley faces have feelings.\nShame i didnt keep the reciept as thats 40quid i wont see again but Corden will.\n\nStill cant tell you what the plot was about.

Truly a modern classic. (Minor spoilers)\nThis is a masterpiece, what more is there to say about this godsend of a movie.\nIf you haven't watched it: Watch it!\nIf you have watched it: Watch again!\nWords cannot describe the greatness of this movie. It single handedly restored my faith in god.\nFirst of all, the characters, oh man were the characters great.\nT.J. Miller as \"Gene\" did an amazing job. You could really feel the dedication that went into his role. Gene as a character was so relatable, his averegeness and his daily struggle really connected with me on a deep emotional level.\nAnd Hi-5. I liked James Corden before this movie but this movie took him to the next level for me. He was so energetic and silly in all the nice ways. Just seeing him on screen made me happy.\nJailbreak was meh (haha get it because Gene is a meh emoji hahahahahhahaharofllmaololxd)\nDon't get me wrong Anna Faris did a great job but I just didn't feel the connection to her character, atleast her romantic subplot with Gene was great. Really enyojed it.\nSmiler (Maja Rudolph) was also the perfect villain. Her constant smile was almost creepy at times and also gave a perfect contrast to her evil self.\nAnd of course, best of all, Patrick Stewart as \"Poop\". You can't even start describing his character. It was just way too great.\n\nHonestly we don't deserve this movie.","displayName":"Carl P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-29T11:28:06.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-29T11:42:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"976654212","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carl P","accountLink":"/user/id/976654212"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie i have ever seen in my whole life.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/115298955802995/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-29T11:18:37.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-29T11:19:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"976654202","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976654202"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Movie is super funny !","displayName":"Brenda O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-29T08:48:45.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-29T08:48:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"976654027","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brenda O","accountLink":"/user/id/976654027"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Too primitive animation in 3d.
