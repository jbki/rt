I thought it would at least be good for the purpose of jest and a little self depreciation on the films part.\n\nBut no\n\nI was instead subjected to the longest ad made in the history of mankind. Time stretched to impossible lengths, similar to that of someone sucked into a black hole. My eyes flitted to my friend watching with me, who had a watch on. A look of sheer exhaustion and pain across my face. To my amazement and woe, he responded \"there's still over an hour left.\" I desired to get up and leave multiple times, but alas I had to pay for my sins. My sins of supporting this movie, for wanting to go in the first place, and for dragging an innocent down with me. Every time a pun was made (which was approximately every 3 seconds) I felt a metaphorical knife being driven into my very being. The fact that so many poop emoji puns can be crammed into the 4 minutes of screen time that emoji had was utterly astonishing.\nI am ashamed to be right on the cusp of this generation. Even as I type this, the fact that I have used emojis with these fingers before shakes me to my core and fills me with regret and self loathing.\nI have seen the depths of hell. I am changed forever. I will never get back that piece of me that the Emoji Movie stole from me. My only purpose on this earth now is to prevent the death of more innocent souls. Do not go to the Emoji Movie. Do not make the mistakes I made. I was young and naive. But I still must pay for the evil deed I so willingly did. And with such excitement. I see the error of my ways now.","displayName":"Hanny C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-09-11T20:31:45.000Z","updateDate":"2017-09-11T20:33:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"976685051","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hanny C","accountLink":"/user/id/976685051"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 11, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Poor...
