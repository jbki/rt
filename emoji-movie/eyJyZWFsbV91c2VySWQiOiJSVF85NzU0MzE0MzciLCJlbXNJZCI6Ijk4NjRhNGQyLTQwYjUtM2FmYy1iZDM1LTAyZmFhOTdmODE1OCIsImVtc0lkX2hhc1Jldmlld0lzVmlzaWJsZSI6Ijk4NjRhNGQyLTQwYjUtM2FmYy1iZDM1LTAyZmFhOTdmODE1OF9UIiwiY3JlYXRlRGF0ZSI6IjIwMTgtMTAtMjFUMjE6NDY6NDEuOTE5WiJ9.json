Probably because Sony wanted Money. The Emoji Movie is the most unneeded film ever to be in our existence because why would they even make a movie about Emojis, Just Why??? When I walked into the theatre to see this, I was expecting some crap, but I was wrong, at the start. When I rewatched this movie a couple of times, I started to realise why everybody hates this movie, it is just plain crap. The plot is basic and is when an emoji named Gene, A multi-expressional emoji, sets out on a journey to become a normal emoji. This plot is stupid and bad. I laughed so hard at all the cringy scenes, especially the scene when Genes parents went into YouTube, and Pen Pineapple Apple Pen was playing. \n\nThe film is only kept alive by the great cast which are in it. The cast are T. J. Miller, James Corden and Anna Faris. Don't forget Sir Patrick Stewart playing the Poop Emoji, true cinematic gold. I found Anna Faris's character, JailBreak a lot like Wyldstyle from the Lego Movie, Oh I forgot it is a copy of Wyldstyle, Sony needs new ideas instead of copying other people's characters. The dialogue for this movie is very stupid and lazily written because when Hi 5 goes missing, Gene asks like 5 minutes later, wait where's Hi 5. The film is basically a huge advert for mobile games, especially Just Dance and Candy Crush Saga. Why would children who are watching this movie be interested in mobile games, nobody would. This film shoves product placement right down your throat and keeps on giving you more like every 5 minutes that the movie progresses. \n\nYou can clearly tell the Sony didn't have idea because they copied Wreck It Ralph, Inside Out and The Lego Movie. All those movie are brilliant, that's why The Emoji Movie copied they're out of ideas. Hopefully the emoji movie 2 (if it comes out) isn't called The Emoji Movie 2: Gene Breaks The Internet. I am really made The Popeye movie is held back for five years because Sony wanted to make this crap. The only thing I would say is good about this abomination is the great cast, great songs and the animation, which wasn't great but good. \n\nSo Overall, The Emoji Movie is a crash grab for Sony because they wanted more money. Due to the good cast and songs, I would say hate watch The Emoji Movie, not alone but with friends so you and your friends so you can make fun of this garbage. \n\nGrade D","displayName":"Shaun B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-10-11T23:32:22.000Z","updateDate":"2019-02-24T01:45:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"977271135","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shaun B","accountLink":"/user/id/977271135"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"My cock got caught in my zipper when I watched this movie and I needed sixteen stitches.
