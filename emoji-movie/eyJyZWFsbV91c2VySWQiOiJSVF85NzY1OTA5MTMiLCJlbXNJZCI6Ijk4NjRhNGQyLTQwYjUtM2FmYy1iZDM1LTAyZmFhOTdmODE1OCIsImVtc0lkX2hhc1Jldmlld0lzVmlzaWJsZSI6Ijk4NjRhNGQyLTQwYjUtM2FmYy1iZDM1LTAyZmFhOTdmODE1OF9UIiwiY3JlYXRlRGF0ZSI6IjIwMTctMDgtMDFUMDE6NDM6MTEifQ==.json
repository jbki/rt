The film industry will no longer be the same with this ever-lasting classic. The repetitive humour is somewhat quirky and alleviating to the current movies in the box office.The storyline is something that will change the way we see film and television forever. Simply one of the best movies I have ever seen.

Any faith he had  in his life I could see draining from his pittifull existence as each goddamn poop joke brought him closer to death.
