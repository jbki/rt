The music and animation were beautiful, and the plot, while predictable, was still fairly intriguing and kept me interesting. Overall, I would recommend seeing it regardless of your age. For maximum enjoyment, I would recommend seeing it late at night so you get your own private screening.","displayName":"Eddie Z","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100003790134671/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T22:30:02.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T22:35:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"970103139","realm":"RT","displayName":"Eddie Z","accountLink":"/user/id/970103139"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Leaves you asking...why?","displayName":"Donovan C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T22:29:44.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T10:43:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"976580760","realm":"RT","displayName":"Donovan C","accountLink":"/user/id/976580760"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Horrible.

The biggest issue with this movie is it showed glimpses of some really interesting ideas but failed to capitalize on those ideas. Even some of the jokes were wasted by the writers taking it in a direction that killed the joke.","displayName":"Joseph C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T22:01:10.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T22:03:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"907407716","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joseph C","accountLink":"/user/id/907407716"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie of 2017. I can't imagine how many Oscars this will get. The casting is amazing and the animation is incredible! The story is packed with fantastic jokes and one of the greatest plots ever. The soundtrack is killer and totally made me tear up in the theater. A must-see of 2017. Dunkirk and War for the Planet of the Apes came out, but they are not nearly at the same  level of mastery of cinematic production as this movie. I plan to see it as many times as possible and I can't wait for the Blu ray release to fully get the experience that I did at the theater.","displayName":"Jack B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/469050746636246/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T21:59:20.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T22:09:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"973243869","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jack B","accountLink":"/user/id/973243869"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The movie was very underwhelming.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1929766447237948/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T21:57:38.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T21:58:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"976580678","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976580678"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Me Me Big Piece of Sir Patrick Stewart","displayName":"Matt S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T21:55:32.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T21:55:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"965355506","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matt S","accountLink":"/user/id/965355506"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"the worst movie in the history of movies","displayName":"tyler e","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T21:54:51.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T21:55:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"976515634","realm":"RT","displayName":"tyler e","accountLink":"/user/id/976515634"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"}]}
