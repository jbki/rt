I can't argue about the animation though, it was pretty descent, but still I felt like I was watching wreck it Ralph, the Lego movie and inside out. I mean the kids will like it, but the adults and teens will probably sleep in the movie theatre The emoji movie just fails at everything but the animation.","displayName":"LB Movie R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-06-24T19:45:07.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-03T03:44:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"976215963","realm":"RT","displayName":"LB Movie R","accountLink":"/user/id/976215963"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 24, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I'm not sure why everyone is trashing this movie. Yes, it was predictable, but was it bad? No. It was cute, funny, clever, and a cool way to relate with modern times and the younger generation. Don't be so elite that you can't enjoy what is obviously meant to be a kid's movie. I liked it and would watch it again.
