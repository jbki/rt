Everything was perfect from animation to casting everything was TOP NOTCH! It was so beautifully put together and emotional (Or should i say emojinal????!) that at moment i couldnt help but let a single tear escape from my left eye and slowly hit my theigh as i thought \"Wow how did they create such a masterpiece?\". I personally went to go laugh and well i suggest you wait till the bluray if you laugh like a fucking haiena because i can say without in my heart that you will burst out laughing! The jokes were amazing and the delivery was perfectly timed! I personally think this movie was even better than the legandary \"Saving Christmas\" and even \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\"","displayName":"Dani M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T14:40:13.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T14:52:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"976578971","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dani M","accountLink":"/user/id/976578971"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I haven't even seen it yet but this movie is the best piece released since the dawn of cinematography.","displayName":"Evan S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T14:39:44.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T14:40:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"976578970","realm":"RT","displayName":"Evan S","accountLink":"/user/id/976578970"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"So fine ????????????????????????????????","displayName":"Jade H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T14:39:06.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T14:40:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"976578965","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jade H","accountLink":"/user/id/976578965"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Phenomenal.
