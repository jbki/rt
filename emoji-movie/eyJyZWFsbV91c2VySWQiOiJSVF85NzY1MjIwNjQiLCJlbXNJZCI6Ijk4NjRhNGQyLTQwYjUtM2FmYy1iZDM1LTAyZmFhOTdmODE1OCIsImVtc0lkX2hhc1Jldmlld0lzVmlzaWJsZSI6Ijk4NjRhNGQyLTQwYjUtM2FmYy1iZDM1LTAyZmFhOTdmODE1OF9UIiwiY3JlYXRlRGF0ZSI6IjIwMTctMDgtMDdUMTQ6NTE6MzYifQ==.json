Sony copied what Wreck-it-Ralph did just so they can make a quick buck. There were more advertisements than actual movie. The movie was made so that kids that can barely think can watch the movie and laugh at the poop emoji making poop jokes. It was so generic that you can take any concept in the world and make a movie just like this movie. I wish I had used my time and money correctly to go see or do literally anything else in existence instead of watch this. Your kids would be more thrilled by watching dust settle on the tickets for this movie than to actually watch it. I give this movie a -6 star rating.","displayName":"Hugh M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-07T12:45:51.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-07T12:57:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"976607895","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hugh M","accountLink":"/user/id/976607895"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 07, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My name is Jude and I am seven years. I think the Emoji movie was great!\nIt was a little long but I didn't mind. I would love to see it again. \nThe characters were great. I like the end because Meh was a malfunction and could turn into any emoji he wanted. He got to make a moving emoji picture that changed into different emojies.","displayName":"Mike S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-07T12:30:18.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-07T12:33:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"976607809","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mike S","accountLink":"/user/id/976607809"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 07, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING.
