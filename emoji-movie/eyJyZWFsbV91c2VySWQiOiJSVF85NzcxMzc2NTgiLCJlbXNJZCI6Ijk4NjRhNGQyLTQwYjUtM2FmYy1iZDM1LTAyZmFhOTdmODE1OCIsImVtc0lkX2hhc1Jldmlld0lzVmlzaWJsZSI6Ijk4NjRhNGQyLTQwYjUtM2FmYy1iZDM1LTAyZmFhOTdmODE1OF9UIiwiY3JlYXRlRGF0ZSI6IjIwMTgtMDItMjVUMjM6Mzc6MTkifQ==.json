But this is a movie about emojis. Those little things in your phone that only teenage girls use unless of course you are middle aged and trying to be 'hip and cool'. I don't think I need to waste my time typing to show you how bad it is. Could you stoop any lower as a human being by seeing this movie? Not really. Not unless you were one of the monsters involved with making it.","displayName":"Luke A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-02-25T21:13:30.000Z","updateDate":"2018-02-25T21:18:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977137467","realm":"RT","displayName":"Luke A","accountLink":"/user/id/977137467"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I decided to watch this movie because I had heard it was arguably one of the worst movies ever made, and I was not disappointed.  I cannot comprehend how movies like this get made and we still haven't gotten a sequel to the 5th Element.  The entire premise is just bafflingly bad and literally makes no sense.  I really hope all of the big names who participated in this are forever reminded of their part in making a movie that should literally get the title of worst movie ever made.

Crappy jokes, speaking of crap there are so many stupid jokes when the poop emoji was around, and there where lots of other things i would talk about but i don't feel like it because i want to tell you the worst part. The end is literally just an ad for the new animoji, at the end (Spoiler Warning) the meh emoji use its abilities as a \"malfunction\" and look like other emojis and changes during a scan to look animated, and eventually animated emojis were put on the IPhone X.
