This is not a good movie at all but the silliness of it all and Patrick Stewart as the Poop emoji actually made me chuckle a few times. When a studio is determined to make a movie story be damned this is what you get. But it could have been worse. Oh and side note to TJ Miller I hope HBO will hold your character for you in Silicon Valley because this is not a career maker","displayName":"Nick B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-15T18:24:06.000Z","updateDate":"2017-12-15T18:27:59.000Z","user":{"userId":"974149520","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nick B","accountLink":"/user/id/974149520"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 15, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Not great, but not necessarily bad either.

Everything this movie did caused me to have a seizure for joy. I liked this movie so much I watched in the theaters 7 times. I now have acquired this film on Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital.
