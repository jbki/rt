The animation was better than any Miyazaki film, and the environment was more detailed than The Good Dinosaur. The dialogue was better than Shrek. The concept was more inspired than Inside Out. It had more heart than Hotel Transylvania or Toy Story 2/3. It's gonna win all the Oscars, including best film, animation, actor, and supporting roles. It deserves a higher score on this site; so I'm going to just imagine that the score is like Golf, in which lower is better. If you don't agree with me, then you just didn't get it.","displayName":"Alexander S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100006215050090/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T20:35:19.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-10T00:14:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"954995713","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alexander S","accountLink":"/user/id/954995713"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Foodfight! is a 2012 American computer animated adventure comedy film produced by Threshold Entertainment and directed by Larry Kasanoff. The film features the voices of Charlie Sheen, Wayne Brady, Hilary Duff, Eva Longoria, Larry Miller, and Christopher Lloyd. It tells the story of brand mascots (\"ikes\") who come to life in a supermarket after closing time, and their struggles against the villainous forces of \"Brand X\".\n\nDespite Kasanoff raising tens of millions in funding,[4] Foodfight! had a troubled and much delayed production. The film was originally scheduled for a Christmas 2003 theatrical release,[5] however this failed to materialize and later planned release dates were also missed.[4][6] Eventually, after the producers defaulted on a loan, in September 2011 creditors auctioned off the film's assets and all associated rights.[7][8] In 2012, the film had a low-key release, being direct-to-DVD in most territories.\n\nContents  [hide] \n1\tPlot\n2\tCast\n3\tProduction\n4\tRelease\n4.1\tCritical reception\n4.2\tHome media\n5\tMerchandise\n6\tReferences\n7\tExternal links\nPlot[edit]\nFoodfight! takes place in the \"Marketropolis\" supermarket. After closing time, the supermarket transforms into a city in which all the citizens are \"Ikes\", personified well-known marketing icons.\n\nIn the Ikes' world, heroic cereal mascot Dex Dogtective is about to propose to his girlfriend Sunshine Goodness, a raisin mascot, but she goes missing just before he is able to do so.\n\nSix months later, in the 'real world', a Brand X representative called \"Mr. Clipboard\" arrives at Marketropolis and aggressively pushes Brand X's range of generic products. In the world of the Ikes, the arrival of Lady X, the seductive Brand X detergent Ike, causes a commotion at Dex's club, the Copabanana.\n\nBrand X products begin to replace previous products, which is mirrored in the Ikes' world with the deaths of several Ikes. After Dex's friend Daredevil Dan (a chocolate squirrel) disappears, Dex begins to investigate. After rebuffing Lady X's attempts to bring him to Brand X's side, Dex is locked in a dryer with Dan to be melted but the two manage to escape. Dan and Dex find out that Brand X contains an addictive and toxic secret ingredient.\n\nDex and Dan attempt to initiate a product recall with the store owner's computer. A Brand X Ike cuts power just as they send the message. Dex then rallies the citizens of Marketropolis to fight the armies of Brand X in a massive food fight. The citizens win the battle through cunning use of the supermarket's electricity and lightning rods to protect their own buildings.\n\nDan rescues Sunshine who had been held hostage in the Brand X tower and escapes with the help of Dan. Mr Clipboard then enters the Ike's world, and it is discovered that he is a robot controlled by Lady X. Lady X reveals that she had previously been the hideous Ike of an unsuccessful brand of prunes, and had been stealing Sunshine's essence to create a new brand. Dex and Sunshine defeat her, reverting her to her original form. With Brand X defeated, and a cure found that revives the killed Ikes, Dex and Sunshine finally marry.","displayName":"Jonathan W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T20:27:55.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T20:34:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"976580399","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonathan W","accountLink":"/user/id/976580399"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie is without a doubt the best film of the past century!
