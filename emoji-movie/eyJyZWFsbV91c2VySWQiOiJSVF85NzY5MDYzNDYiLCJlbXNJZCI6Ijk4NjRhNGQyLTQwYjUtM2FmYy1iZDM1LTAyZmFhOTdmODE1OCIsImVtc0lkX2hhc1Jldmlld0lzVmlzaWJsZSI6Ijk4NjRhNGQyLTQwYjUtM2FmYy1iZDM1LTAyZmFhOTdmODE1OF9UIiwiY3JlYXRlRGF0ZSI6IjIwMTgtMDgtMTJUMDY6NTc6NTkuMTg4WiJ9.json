I went to see it with my kids and seeing their precious little smiles made me smile. The movie was a good way to entertain them on a rainy day. And I didn't mind it myself. And when we were on vacation about a month ago, it came on TV at night and the kids were mesmerized by the TV and stayed up until the credits were done. Overall, The Emoji Movie is an entertaining movie and is the perfect example of a rainy-day-with-the-kids movie.","displayName":"Becky S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-10T11:28:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-10T11:34:03.000Z","user":{"userId":"977346627","realm":"RT","displayName":"Becky S","accountLink":"/user/id/977346627"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 10, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Absolute garbage.\nTerrible jokes.\nAn absolute cash grab,and it worked.It's reviews are terrible yet it still made so much money.\nVery Very forced product placements\nThey had so much fun playing..dance dance revolution?Available for IOS and Android,and then candy crush.\nIf I had to state a positive.....\n\nTJ Miller was good considering what he had to work with.","displayName":"Peyton W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-08-09T09:55:28.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-09T09:55:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977405426","realm":"RT","displayName":"Peyton W","accountLink":"/user/id/977405426"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I can't imagine a movie that insults audiences so badly that their decomposed brains are pouring out of their ears.\n0/10 B's (don't ever see this damn film.
