The plot is stupid, pandery, and above all cliche. And on top of all that, even the animation itself is lazily thrown together, with minimal continuity or logic within it's own set of rules. On top of all that, the writers of this film seem not to understand how phones work at all, as throughout the film they seem to think that phones have a recycle bin, data can be un-deleated, and that internet trolls are programs instead of actual people.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/157945701443458/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T13:44:00.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T13:51:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"976578646","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976578646"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A Film Masterpiece by Sony animations with a fantastic score.
