Their last couple of movies (such as Ghostbusters) are a total planewreck that even a 9/11 looks like nothing!\nSecond: they copied several good and bad movies and placed in one (Main character is same as Ralph from Wreck it Ralph, his sidekick is the same as Donkey from Shrek, he exists only because of \"laughs\", and Jailbreak looks exactly the same as the girl from Lego Movie, with personality of her and Disgust from Inside Out)\nThird: The plot is a mix of Inside Out and Wreck It Ralph\nFourth: How the fuck can you play Just Dance on a mobile phone?! Also it is stereotypical... very very fucking stereotypical... its like a nazi came to the Jew and said \"Because you did not pay 1$ of taxes, you are parsimonius, you are a Jew\", then later takes him to Auschwitz...\nOverall, we can all agree that this movie deserves five stars. What an I talking about, give him 77 stars, give him infinite stars, great piece of art that we will remember in a couple of years and compare it with The Room.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2035328353366985/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-03T10:23:41.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-03T10:34:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"976596413","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976596413"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 03, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is the best movie ever created, thousands of years of evolution have lead up to this movie, before this movie, I was sad every single day of my life without anything to entertain me, after this movie, I could say that I am the happiest human alive","displayName":"Gold K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-03T10:18:13.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-03T10:20:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"976596407","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gold K","accountLink":"/user/id/976596407"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 03, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Horrible film, movie idea, and production.
