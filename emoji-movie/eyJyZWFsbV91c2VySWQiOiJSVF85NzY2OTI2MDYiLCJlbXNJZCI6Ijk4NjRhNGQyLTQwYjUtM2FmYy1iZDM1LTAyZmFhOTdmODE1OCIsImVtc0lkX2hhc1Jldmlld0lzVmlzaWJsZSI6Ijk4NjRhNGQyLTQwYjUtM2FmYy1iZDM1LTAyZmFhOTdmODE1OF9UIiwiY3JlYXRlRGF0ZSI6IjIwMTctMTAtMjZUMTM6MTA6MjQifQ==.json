But my niece wanted to see it, so I went. I didn't really like this fil much. I mean yes phones and the internet are now a big part of our lives and we use them for all sorts of things. I'm just not sure a movie about emojis is really what anyone, except fanatics would like. Phones are cool and all, but there a part of everyday life, we use them but there not so super cool that they or their programs would warrant s movie. Still there are some laughs to be had here by some and it's better than Cars 3. But most movies are, so that's not saying much.","displayName":"Rhiannon B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-26T04:27:22.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-26T04:49:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"976788067","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rhiannon B","accountLink":"/user/id/976788067"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 26, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"10/10 one of the best 2017 movies","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/885273818304930/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-26T03:33:38.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-26T03:33:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"976788043","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976788043"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 26, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"The movie is amusing but can be a bit better.","displayName":"Karim G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-26T02:55:29.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-26T02:56:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"976788010","realm":"RT","displayName":"Karim G","accountLink":"/user/id/976788010"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 26, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It was not as bad as everyone says it was. When I first heard of it, I thought \"wth are we doing these days? This is the dumbest idea ever.\" With all of the bad reviews and terrible score on RT...I thought \"there is no way it is that terrible.\" I rented it from redbox yesterday...and I have to say...It was a cute movie. I giggled in a few of the parts. It was predictable but I find very few movies achieve unpredictability these days. The plot made sense and was easy to follow. Again, this is a kids movie. I thought the use of the technical terms and their corresponding animations to illustrate them were great to give an idea to children of what those mean. This is still a better movie than Sausage Party.","displayName":"Brigette G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-25T16:00:23.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-25T16:18:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"976787168","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brigette G","accountLink":"/user/id/976787168"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 25, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I LOVED IT 10/10 IGN a","displayName":"IGN O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-25T07:28:00.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-25T07:32:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"976786400","realm":"RT","displayName":"IGN O","accountLink":"/user/id/976786400"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 25, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I wasn't expecting much from this movie after reading some of the reviews.
