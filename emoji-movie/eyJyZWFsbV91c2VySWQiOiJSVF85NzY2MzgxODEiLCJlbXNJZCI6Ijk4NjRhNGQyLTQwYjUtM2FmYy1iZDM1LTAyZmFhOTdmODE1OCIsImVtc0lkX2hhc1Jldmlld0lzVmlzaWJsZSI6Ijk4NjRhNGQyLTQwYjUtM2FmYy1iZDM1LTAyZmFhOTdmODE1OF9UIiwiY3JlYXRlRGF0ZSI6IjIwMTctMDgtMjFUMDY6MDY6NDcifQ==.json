Certainly not one star. A lot of thought has gone into it I feel. It's actually quite clever and littered with technical jargon which a geek like me gets. The way they go into each app is clever and it does make you laugh. At times the plot feels long winded and yes it repeats the same basic plot as hundreds of other films. It's not as good as inside out. So it's no masterpiece but me and my wife (no kids) enjoyed it. We have unlimited so thought why not try it after liking the trailers. Would I pay to see it. Probably only if I had kids. I'd definitely watch it on Netflix though.","displayName":"Paul T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/524170105/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-20T11:00:15.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-20T11:00:15.000Z","user":{"userId":"791507181","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paul T","accountLink":"/user/id/791507181"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 20, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The emoji movie was awesome I would definitely see again","displayName":"Jacob K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-20T10:36:20.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-20T10:37:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"976636301","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jacob K","accountLink":"/user/id/976636301"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 20, 2017"}]}
