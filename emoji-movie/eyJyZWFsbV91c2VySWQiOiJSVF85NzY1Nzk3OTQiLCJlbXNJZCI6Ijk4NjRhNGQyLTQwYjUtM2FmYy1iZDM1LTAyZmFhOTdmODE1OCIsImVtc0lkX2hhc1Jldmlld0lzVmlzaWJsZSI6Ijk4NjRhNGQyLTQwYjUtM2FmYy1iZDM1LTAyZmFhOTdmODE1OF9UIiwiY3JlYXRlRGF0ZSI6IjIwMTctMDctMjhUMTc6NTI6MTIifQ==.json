It was clear sony saw the success of the movie Inside Out and wanted to cash in on the premise of finding who you are. There was zero effort put into the movie, which is abundantly clear right from the start. In Inside Out you have personifications of a young girl's emotions during a hard time in her life. One of those emotions want's to be the only one, but finds out that all emotions are important, which is the exact same idea the \"Emoji Movie\" was trying to sell.\n   This thing is a discrace to every movie that came before it and is the living embodiment of the downside of capitalism. Every aspect of this movie was stollen from other popular movies and packaged so that it can appeal to the largest audience possible. THERE EMOJIS FOR FUCKS SAKE. They are used to portray almost every emotion humans posses. And that brings me to my next point.\n   I cant even take this movie, or the whole of sony entertainment seriously anymore. Of all the things they could have made a movie about, they chose emojis. FUCKING EMOTICONS. SMALL PICTURES USED IN TEXT AS A MEANS OF SHOWING EMOTION. \n   In conclusion, this garbage does not deserve a single rating above 0 stars. Every aspect of it was horrible and i would rather poor clorox bleach into my eyes than watch this disgusting thing. It is trully the lowest point in all of human existence.","displayName":"seven t","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T17:47:35.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T18:06:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"976579772","realm":"RT","displayName":"seven t","accountLink":"/user/id/976579772"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"wejpkj;LTKSTEFDLFKHFNHLGSDJNJE5HYRISEJK;RKY4WHIE;HRLEKLRHNIEHRNWJI;RWJKGNJBHRWYJLGEUW4ILEAHBEATQH3LKWhilJ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/138179103443899/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T17:46:55.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T17:47:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"976579767","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976579767"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A truly inspirational movie, almost as inspirational as Just dance now available for free on android and ios","displayName":"Ronalds C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T17:46:26.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T17:47:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"976579765","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ronalds C","accountLink":"/user/id/976579765"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Holy crap this movie sux.","displayName":"REdd Z","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T17:46:04.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T17:46:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"965264610","realm":"RT","displayName":"REdd Z","accountLink":"/user/id/965264610"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Now, not many people have witnessed what I have. I've witnessed the most beautiful of things. A butterfly emerging from it's cocoon after metamorphosis or perhaps held a newborn child. The most beautiful thing I had ever seen, the best experience, was holding my daughter in my arms for the first time. You could call me a connoisseur of beauty, perhaps. Nothing in my 48 years of existence can top this fine piece of art. Using only the BEST of artists to write, create, and narrate this movie, Tony Leondis has managed to create a utopia that will reside in my heart for years to come. I hope one day I'll enjoy this with my grandchildren, and they, with theirs. When I walked into that theater, I did not expect more than a wasted 91 minutes, but now I am a changed man. The Emoji Movie captures the essence of human emotion in the most captivating ways. What better way to show us the flaws in our society than with an allegory using beloved emoji. Maybe we can all learn something from this beautiful story that just so happens to be the pinnacle of art.","displayName":"Deven M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T17:42:24.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T18:08:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"976579746","realm":"RT","displayName":"Deven M","accountLink":"/user/id/976579746"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Dear god, just kill me now.
