A well constructed story of depth with the use of many applications we use today like \"Candy Crush\". The way they put in the fictional characters into our everyday enjoyment mechanisms is outstanding. The jokes about flatulence are very laugh worthy. Not enough manure jokes though. Very good piece of constructed filmography but you should read the manga first. One of my favorite anime movies of all time. 100 emoticon out of 100 emoticon.","displayName":"benjamin f","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T15:25:42.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T15:32:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"976586919","realm":"RT","displayName":"benjamin f","accountLink":"/user/id/976586919"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Movie I've ever seen only flaw is I can't rate it ??/10","displayName":"Vincent V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T15:25:16.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T15:26:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"976586918","realm":"RT","displayName":"Vincent V","accountLink":"/user/id/976586918"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This steaming pile of ?? was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was a 71 minute long advertisement for Sony phones, Youtube, Dropbox, Spotify, Candy Crush... I could go on. Spoiler Alert (for those who care), this explains the plot. The main character, a meh emoji, has more than one emotion. He travels through a phone (read - gigantic billboard for advertisements) to be hacked so he become a normal emoji, after a smiley face emoji tries to kill him for being a multi-faceted emoji. He realizes that it's okay to be multi-faceted and everyone likes him for making the owner of the phone happy.\nBesides being one of the most overused plots in mainstream children's movies (nobody likes the main character until they realize they don't always have to care what others think, prompting everyone to love the main character for embracing differences), the \"moral\" is completely unclear. In the beginning, the narrator remarks on \"kids these days, always on their phones.\" The entire movie results in the character not deleting his phone and using it to [spoiler alert again] take photos of himself at the fall dance. This is apparently a triumph and is trumpeted by loud music that wasn't popular several years ago.\nOverall, I would give this movie zero stars, except that's not an option. Please don't watch it, but if you have to? Try lightening the mood afterwards by watching Schindler's List.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/138109946785628/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T15:16:58.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T15:39:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"976586894","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976586894"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fairly original, and with jokes that are so unfunny there funny.
