It takes a plot too simple to mess up and somehow messes it up. On top of that, the pacing drags, characters are 2 dimensional, it lies about character development, and it has plot holes so big they could consume the whole planet. Contradictory. Badly written. Cringe worthy. It's a bad time no matter what mood you're in.","displayName":"Joel  J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-09-22T16:12:13.000Z","updateDate":"2017-09-22T16:13:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"975177022","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joel  J","accountLink":"/user/id/975177022"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 22, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Funny, creative, cute, and with dazzling animation, this is a fun family film if approached with an open mind.","displayName":"Amelia T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-09-22T06:50:52.000Z","updateDate":"2017-09-22T06:51:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"976707645","realm":"RT","displayName":"Amelia T","accountLink":"/user/id/976707645"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 22, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"This movie was a desperate attempt from Sony Animations to appeal to younger audiences, which failed terribly. The movie is quite an abomination, and has an extremely predictable and repetitive plot. If that wasn't enough, the movie is the equivalent of one massive ad for mobile apps. I was shocked to hear some of the voice actors that decided to completely butcher their reputation for this excuse of a comprehensible movie- even one of my favorite actors, Patrick Stewart, has burnt all of my respect for him just because he was put in this \"film.\" The movie has little to no charm, humor, or even an understandable story. It pains me to see how far down the hole some animation studios have went, it really does. Overall, this film is no doubt one of the worst in decades- all genres included.","displayName":"Jason N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-09-21T18:08:15.000Z","updateDate":"2017-09-21T18:14:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"976706713","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jason N","accountLink":"/user/id/976706713"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 21, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"loved it?\nmor liek emojied it!","displayName":"Gilford T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-09-21T05:59:31.000Z","updateDate":"2017-09-21T06:00:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"976705649","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gilford T","accountLink":"/user/id/976705649"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 21, 2017"}]}
