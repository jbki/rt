If you want a \"you can fit in and still be yourself\" story, watch Wreck-It Ralph.\nOnly positive thing I can say is that the animation is well-done and it's bright and colorful (which is a plus for me).\nBiggest problem, aside from the fact it's about emojis, is that it's extremely predictable and a 100% cash-in. They got sponsers from Candy Crush, Just Dance, Spotify, Twitter, Dropbox and YouTube (all were mentioned/used in some way in the movie).\nThey spent too long on dead memes. Not only is it a shitty meme, it now dates the movie even more than it already was doing.\nRating: 3/10\nPros: Bright and colorful, the plot's been done worse in other films\nCons: Dead memes, \"Bye, Felicia\", Eggplant is a not-used emoji, villian has no redeemable qualities, Patrick Stewart is Poop, hit-and-miss jokes that miss so hard it hurts, tried pandering too hard, sponserships, it's about emojis.","displayName":"Michael C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-08T14:58:34.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-08T14:59:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"976610368","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael C","accountLink":"/user/id/976610368"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 08, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"It's self explanatory.","displayName":"Jack W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-08T14:38:31.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-08T14:38:31.000Z","user":{"userId":"945206823","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jack W","accountLink":"/user/id/945206823"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 08, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I wish I could give it 0 stars.

This movie was so well put together with the different emoji and apps along with the storyline! It was great because you could relate to the social media apps etc so it made it thoroughly enjoyable!
