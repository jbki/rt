Rather than simply featuring some degree of product placement, the movie itself is placed into and featured around the product. The various apps the emoji travel through were well thought out, and indeed quite magical.\n\nOlder audiences will not like the emoji movie. Teenagers will find it \"cringy\" and there is little to offer adults. Children do not know any better. For them I think it will be something of a hit, in the same unhealthy way that McDonalds is a hit with that demographic, which is quite sad.","displayName":"Fehzor R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-01T22:12:00.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-01T22:35:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"976593035","realm":"RT","displayName":"Fehzor R","accountLink":"/user/id/976593035"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 01, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very interesting ideas ?????","displayName":"Ibrahim H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-01T21:18:22.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-01T21:18:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"959757471","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ibrahim H","accountLink":"/user/id/959757471"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 01, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Surprisingly not as bad as I thought it would be.
