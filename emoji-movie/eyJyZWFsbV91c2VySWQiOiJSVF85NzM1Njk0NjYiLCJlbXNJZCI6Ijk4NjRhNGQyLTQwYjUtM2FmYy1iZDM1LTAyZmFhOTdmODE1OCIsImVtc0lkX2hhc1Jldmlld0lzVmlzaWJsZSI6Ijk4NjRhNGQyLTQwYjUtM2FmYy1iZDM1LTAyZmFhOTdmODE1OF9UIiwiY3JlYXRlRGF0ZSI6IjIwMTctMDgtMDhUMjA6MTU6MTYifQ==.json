It is like the flipped version of Inside Out. It basically throws the clich√© concept of finding your place in the world, which is a good idea for kids, but the storytelling fails to deliver. It also throws in unnecessary jokes that  failed to amuse the audience as they popped out of nowhere. Even worse, they added in the \"emoji pop\"  which is a  cringe worthy dance where you cover your face and show an expression and you cover your face again and show another one, and so on.","displayName":"JC C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-08T19:40:28.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-08T19:49:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"976610947","realm":"RT","displayName":"JC C","accountLink":"/user/id/976610947"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 08, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"A time-waster, subjective, not funny, boring and stressful movie that is plagued with lots and lots of advertising. This is the worst movie of 2017 so far and maybe the worst animated movie aswell. It's full of contradictions, stereotypes and is an inciter to not live the real life, to keep stuck in a cellphone and to solve any real-life problem with an emoji. The world doesn't work like this and the people either. I don't know what the directors were thinking about this would be a good movie.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1365902620194069/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-08T19:06:57.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-08T19:13:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"976610865","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976610865"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 08, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Ok, this film isn't offensively bad, but rather a blatant ripoff of both Wreck It Ralph AND The Lego Movie. It's just insulting to older adults who aren't familiar with the apps shown, and treats its target audience like they are 3 years old. There are some clever moments, with how the worlds of some apps are portrayed. You will sigh and roll your eyes a LOT more than you will find yourself genuinely -- not sarcastically --  laughing. This is just a simple, bad film.","displayName":"DeVaughn B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-08T18:31:08.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-08T18:32:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"966389829","realm":"RT","displayName":"DeVaughn B","accountLink":"/user/id/966389829"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 08, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I took the kids on 8-7-2017 and we laughed it was funny.

Speaking volumes in how greatly he wished to strive from under his famous father's shadow, \"Meh\" takes little time before figuring out that the truest of identities is that of friendship and trust. \n\nMy son was so moved by this movie, that we've begun to sew up a \"Poop emoji\" suit for him for Halloween this year, as to help define himself from the rest of his friends.\n\nIf you haven't already, take your kids to go see this movie!","displayName":"Jerome B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-08T15:47:55.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-08T15:53:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"976610395","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jerome B","accountLink":"/user/id/976610395"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 08, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A truly beautiful creation, a joy to watch!
