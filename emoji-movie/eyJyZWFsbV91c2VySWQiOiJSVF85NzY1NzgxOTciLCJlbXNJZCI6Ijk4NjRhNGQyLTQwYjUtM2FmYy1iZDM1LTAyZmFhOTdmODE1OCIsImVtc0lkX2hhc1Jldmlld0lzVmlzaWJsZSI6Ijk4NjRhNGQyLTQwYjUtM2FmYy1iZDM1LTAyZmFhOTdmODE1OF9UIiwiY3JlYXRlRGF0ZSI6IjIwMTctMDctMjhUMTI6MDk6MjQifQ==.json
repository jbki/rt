This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, it's probably not in my top 10. However, this is the most shameless, desperate and sad effort I can imagine.\n\nThe premise reeks of corporate group-think, trying to find something young and widespread, followed by some jackass who blurts out \"I got it!\". He looks ahead and pauses, building suspense before he puts forth his great epiphany. He says one word: emojis! The group loves the idea, everyone gets excited because teens love their phones and use emojis, we'll be rolling in money for sure. We'll sell toys, have a spinoff t.v. show, sequels galore!!\n\nThis project is an insult to movie-goers. Every single person associated with this dumpster fire should feel shame.","displayName":"vinny f","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T11:57:14.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T11:57:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"976578070","realm":"RT","displayName":"vinny f","accountLink":"/user/id/976578070"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Its the best movie ever","displayName":"Emoji M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T11:51:34.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T11:53:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"976578136","realm":"RT","displayName":"Emoji M","accountLink":"/user/id/976578136"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Completely half assed storytelling that didn't even make any sense in the end.
