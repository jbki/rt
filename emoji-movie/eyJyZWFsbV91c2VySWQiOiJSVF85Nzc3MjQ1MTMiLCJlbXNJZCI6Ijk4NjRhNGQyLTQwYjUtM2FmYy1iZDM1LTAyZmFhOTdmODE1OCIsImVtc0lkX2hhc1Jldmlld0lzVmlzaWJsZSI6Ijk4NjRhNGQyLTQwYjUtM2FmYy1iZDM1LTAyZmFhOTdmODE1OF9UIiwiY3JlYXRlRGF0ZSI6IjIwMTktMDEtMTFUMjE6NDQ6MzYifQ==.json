And if there is anything that I hate is a studio with no sense of creativity with any advantages they may have. this especially goes to studios with enough money to give decent animation. but there is one studio out there that I DESPISE not only as an animation studio, but as a complete whole of a company. that company is called Sony Pictures Animation. I hate them with every fiber of my being because they waste their talents with no care in the world of what the hell they show to the public. And yes I did say they do have but only one talent that is just its animation. but that is it. so one day those idiots announced that they would a movie that would later spawn as EVERYTHING WRONG WITH FILMAKING!!! that movie is called the emoji movie. im gonna keep this crap short because I want nothing to do with this film. but I will say that this is the worst thing possible to show to the audience. the story is something out of every movie aimed at children. it also ripped of a few films released prior such as inside out, wreck it ralph, and even the lego movie. it is just obnoxious to see such good animation waste itself ripping off better films than sony will ever make! fuck this film! fuck everything about sony! AND FUCK EMOJIS!!!!!!!!!","displayName":"Joshua E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-08T21:06:00.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-08T21:19:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"977719503","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joshua E","accountLink":"/user/id/977719503"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I was told if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything so I won't say anything","displayName":"Jessica W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-06T17:23:38.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-06T17:24:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"977682590","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jessica W","accountLink":"/user/id/977682590"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Fairly entertaining and clever, some story ideas don't hold together, but there are a lot of creative parts.
