Went only because my 10 year old son was mildly interested in the trailers. I cannot believe this movie got a6-8% rating on Rotten Tomatoes! This movie is for anytthat ever used emojis in texting. This, by far is one of the best movies I've ever watched in the movie theater. If you liked Inside Out, you will LOVE The Emoji Movie. We laughed ALOT, I actually cried in the end. Yes to The Emoji Movie. Whom ever rated this movie on Rottwn Tomatoes ?? must have had a really bad day or week, because the %rating is unjustified!! If you have a smartphone and you use emojis in your texts, PLEASE!!, Do your self a favor and go see this movie. I will gladly see it again and enjoy every minute if I get the chance!

When your children ask where you were on that fateful day, the day that the pinnacle of film-\"meh\"king was reached, what will you tell them?\n     I will be able to stand tall and proud as I describe to them the pure joy that I felt as the first few seconds of this \"meh\"sterpiece graced my eyes. My squad fam and I witnessed the emoji movie's birth together, fidget spinners whirring in our trembling hands whilst Gene and his crew braved the perilous pixels of young Alex's phone. We smiled at the clever and well thought out jokes, tried not to cry as Broom chanted his pitiful lines, and nodded in fervent agreement to Jailbreak's utter smASHing of the patriarchy. You go girl, you go. \n\"Meh\"ving on to the ro\"meh\"ntical aspect, \"meh\"ke sure you bring your uncooked vegetables, because things are about to get stea\"meh\"y ;) Jailbreak and Gene are the couple of the century. \"Meh\"ve over Romeo and Juliet, Genebreak is the hot new couple that EVERyone is swooning over.  So \"meh\"ny sparks were flying between them that all the unpopped kernels in the bottom of my fellow moviegoer's popcorn popped simutaniously, bringing to \"meh\"nd the applause that this \"meh\"vie so completely deserves. I could literally go on forever about how much I love this \"meh\"vie, but the next showing starts in five \"meh\"nutes, and I am not willing to risk \"meh\"ssing out on the first five seconds of film. You truly cannot catch everything this film has to offer on your first viewing, I am still catching delightful easter eggs on my fifth go-around, and have no intention of leaving this theatre until they re\"meh\"ve me forcibly. This Emojiac signing off, - An extremely satisfied consu\"meh\"r.","displayName":"Mildred F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T19:42:41.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T20:10:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"976587683","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mildred F","accountLink":"/user/id/976587683"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"it was the best movie i've ever seen by far. 99999/10. i laughed, i cried, it was an emoji-nal experience.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/132550807347797/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T19:37:19.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T19:37:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"976587671","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976587671"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is probably my new favourite movie. TJ Miller produces his most masterful performance to date, while James Corden pulls off his best role since The Lady in the Van. Even Patrick Stewart is immensely good in this new genre that we have not seen him in much. Fantastic humour throughout the film, and a compelling storyline. I believe that many people will overlook the score as well, which is masterfully done by Patrick Doyle. This is a vastly underrated film, which deserves much more appreciation due to its star-studded cast and wonderful storyline. World Class.","displayName":"Dan S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T19:22:07.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T19:29:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"976587613","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dan S","accountLink":"/user/id/976587613"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Cute for the kids....","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10214194721888324/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T19:05:22.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T19:05:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"976587577","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976587577"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Bad cringe carnival of a movie starring tj miller about emojis.
