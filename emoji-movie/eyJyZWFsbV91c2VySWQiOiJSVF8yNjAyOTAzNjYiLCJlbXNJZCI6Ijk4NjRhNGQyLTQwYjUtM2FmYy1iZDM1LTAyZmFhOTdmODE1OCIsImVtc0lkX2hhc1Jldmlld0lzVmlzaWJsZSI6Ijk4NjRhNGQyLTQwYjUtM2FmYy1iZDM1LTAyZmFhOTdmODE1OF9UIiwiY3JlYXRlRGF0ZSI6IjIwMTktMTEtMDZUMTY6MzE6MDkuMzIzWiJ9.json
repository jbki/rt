The movie was terrible and hard to focus on because josh was screaming and laughing at inappropriate times and started hitting people with his foam swords. I left the theater after the movie was over and I didn’t speak to josh for a week. He then asked to see it again but I declined.

It looks good, the world building is great and it is overall fun and engaging to watch, but it definitely is very mediocre in the areas of humor which is juvenile, scripting which is copying much better films such as ‘Ralph' and ‘Inside Out' and characters who are mostly unlikable stereotypes.","displayName":"David L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000787676881/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-23T12:58:00.295Z","updateDate":"2019-10-23T12:58:00.295Z","user":{"userId":"901488735","realm":"RT","displayName":"David L","accountLink":"/user/id/901488735"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"worst cartoon ive ever seen","displayName":"Todd B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000161711449/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-19T17:54:20.551Z","updateDate":"2019-10-19T17:54:20.551Z","user":{"userId":"921358367","realm":"RT","displayName":"Todd B","accountLink":"/user/id/921358367"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I don't like this movie as a serious piece at all. But this movie is brilliant. The jokes are not funny. There are long \"Just Dance\" and \"Candy Crush\" portions that are giant advertisements. The plot and moral of the story is stale and unoriginal. But I don't see why people would go into this movie expecting a masterpiece with thoughtful writing. On the other hand, the animation is incredible and is ironically hilarious as there is no subtly about how dumb of an idea the movie really is and it shows with how hilarious the execution is. And that is what makes this movie great. If you see this as a satirical view into the meaninglessness of the topic itself, you will have plenty of laughs at the self-aware execution of how horrible it is to have a movie about emojis.

(0 stars) The movie also had many peculiar moments, such as when the emojis began playing Just Dance, not to mention that there were also corny puns throughout the entire movie. (1/2 a star because of the creativity of the puns) Overall, the movie could have been written better, taking that into account I rate The Emoji Movie 1/2 star out of 5 stars.","displayName":"Kayla L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-14T04:20:43.013Z","updateDate":"2019-10-14T04:20:43.027Z","user":{"userId":"978332405","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kayla L","accountLink":"/user/id/978332405"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I can't even watch this movie ironically.","displayName":"Sam R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-14T00:48:37.261Z","updateDate":"2019-10-14T00:48:37.261Z","user":{"userId":"978331919","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sam R","accountLink":"/user/id/978331919"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 14, 2019"}]}
