Me and my friends went to see this in the cinema. Only 3 groups of people walked out to not return. During the film, my friend pointed out that only two people laughed during the whole film: -me (because the puns were just too good) and -some random 50 year old woman (who had a laughing fit half way through, we aren't certain on whether it was because of the film or not).\nThe plot-line was neatly made, character development was at a good pace. Without spoilers: we follow the eggplant emoji on his epic quest to become a favourited emoji, only to be forgotten about. That is, until meh, high five, and jailbreak (please make jailbreak an actual emoji) do a thing, and some more things, almost get trashed, but someone does a thing!\n\nBecause of the above reasons, and the emoji movie's unique, petite community, I have to give it 10/10.\nSir Patric Stewart made a great addition to the movie in the voice of the poop emoji. Some say its a waste of such talent, I say it was what he was born to do. What we were ALL born to do.\n\nGo watch it. Good laugh. I laughed so hard at one point, I almost swallowed my tongue and spent the last half choking (other friends can confirm). So if you don't die of boredom, that sure will. \n\nFun for all ages, the whole family.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/488956978110251/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-07T00:16:01.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-07T00:24:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"976606830","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976606830"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 07, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie ever created, plot was fantastic and the  joke never got old, well she was just absolutely fantastic play by TJ Miller in his roll he was a meh emoji who was a \"malfunction\" and thought that was bad but by the end hr realized he should be true to himself, nevwe before used plot btw. and his jokes I mean they were just fantastic and you could definitely tell by genes dad he  was just great acting and the constant talking in meh sound  never got old the child and fart jokes never got old either. there should have been more fart jokes but that's just my personal opinion but overall I had an amazing time at this movie and laughed the whole way through I give it a 100 emoji out of 10","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1818505121703576/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-06T22:33:01.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-06T22:38:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"976606703","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976606703"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 06, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Exceeded expectations, a good family movie, don't listen what other people say, go and see it for yourself .","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-06T22:08:58.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-06T22:08:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"971889316","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/971889316"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 06, 2017"}]}
