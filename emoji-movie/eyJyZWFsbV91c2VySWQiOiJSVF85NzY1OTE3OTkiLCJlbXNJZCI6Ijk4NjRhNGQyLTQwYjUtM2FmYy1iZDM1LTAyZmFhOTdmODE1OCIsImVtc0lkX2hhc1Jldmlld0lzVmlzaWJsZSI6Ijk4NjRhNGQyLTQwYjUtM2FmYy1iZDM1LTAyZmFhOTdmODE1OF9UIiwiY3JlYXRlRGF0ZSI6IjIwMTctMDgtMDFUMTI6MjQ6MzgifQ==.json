The only funny joke in the entire movie was a subtle middle finger joke. Other than that there was nothing funny about the movie. Just basic fucking cliches that have been used hundreds of times. This movie had all the pieces of a movie but it never really came together. Gene was obviously gonna be loved and respected in the end because of his special talent.
