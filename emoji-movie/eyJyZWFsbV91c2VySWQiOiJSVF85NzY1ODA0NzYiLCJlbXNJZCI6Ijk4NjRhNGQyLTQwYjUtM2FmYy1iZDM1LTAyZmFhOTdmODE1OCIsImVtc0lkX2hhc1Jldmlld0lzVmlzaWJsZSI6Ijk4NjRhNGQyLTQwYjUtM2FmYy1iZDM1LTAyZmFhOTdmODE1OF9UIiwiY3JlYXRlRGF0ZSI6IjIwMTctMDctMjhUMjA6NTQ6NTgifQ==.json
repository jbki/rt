The emoji movie is an ORIGINAL FILM, i'm so sick of all these sequels that we keep getting. Thor 3, Transformers 5, Spiderman 6, NAW fam, emoji movie ONE. In conclusion, go see this movie right now.

It ha the best CGI animation ever. It also had heart and great story telling. It was by far the greatest animated movie of 2017! Like Cars 3? Nah, sit down. And ofcourse I did not have a bias torwards this movie because of jacksfilms. Also amazing cast of voice actors, I bet Richard Stewart's career peaked in this movie. If you're looking for an original concept and movie go watch the emoji movie and don't support all the other movies because they're cashgrab sequels.However, once you buy it on blue ray throw out all your other blue ray movies in your collection because this is the only movie you have to ever watch. For all those that oppose my view, my response is dabbing on the haters.","displayName":"Ridic F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T20:46:06.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T20:51:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"976580453","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ridic F","accountLink":"/user/id/976580453"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best film i've ever seen.
