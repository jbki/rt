While you're watching the film, you can't help but think \"who thought this was a good idea?\" throughout the whole movie. Sony cancelled better movies for this, and T.J. Miller left Silicon Valley for this as well, though I'm sure he has other movie deals and this one was just an easy pay check.\n\nThe movie has a great voice cast, but are they any good? While some of the cast have done great voice work in other animated films, everyone in the movie sounded bored, like the children who were at my screening when this movie was in cinemas. I'm sure it's because the cast knew what they were signing up for, and they didn't want to take their role too seriously.\n\nThe trailer for The Emoji Movie was the most disliked trailer since the remake of Ghostbusters, but there was a chance that The Emoji Movie could be the surprisingly good movie that The Lego Movie was. The Lego Movie was obviously a feature film length advertisement made to sell Legos, but it was also well-animated, funny, and had a thoughtful story that transcended a commercial into an enjoyable and entertaining movie. The Emoji Movie is a feature film length advertisement that The Lego Movie was, but with none of the effort. The concept was lazy, the script was half-assed, the animation was subpar, and even the voice acting was mediocre (despite the great cast).\n\nThe Emoji Movie isn't bad because it's a movie about emojis. It's bad because it's unoriginal, unfunny, and it makes Norm of the North look like a Pixar movie. The Emoji Movie is the WORST animated movie I have ever seen. It makes you rethink some of the worst movies ever made and wonder whether or not they're actually that bad. How do I give this movie 0 stars?","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10205887330573748/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-04-18T12:59:21.000Z","updateDate":"2019-04-18T12:59:25.000Z","user":{"userId":"976641747","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976641747"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"<i>The Emoji Movie</i> is a movie that is bad.
