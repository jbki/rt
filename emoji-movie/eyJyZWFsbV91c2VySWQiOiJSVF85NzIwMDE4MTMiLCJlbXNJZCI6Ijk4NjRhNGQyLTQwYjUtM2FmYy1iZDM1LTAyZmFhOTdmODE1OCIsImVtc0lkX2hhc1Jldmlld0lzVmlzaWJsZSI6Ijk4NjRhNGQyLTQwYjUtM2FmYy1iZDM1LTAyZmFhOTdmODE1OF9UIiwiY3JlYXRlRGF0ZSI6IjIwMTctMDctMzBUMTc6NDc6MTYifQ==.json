Obviously, the film makers aren't pandering to adult crowds. This film is for children. That being said, the film severely lacks originality. There is terrible dialogue, even for an animated film. There were a few chuckles scattered around the film, but they are overshadowed by a thin plot and cheesy characters. Honestly, this seems like more of a rough draft than a final product. \nI would say only the youngest audience would enjoy this film. Better to red box this one. But it's not worth the wait.","displayName":"Chance T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T17:15:55.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T17:19:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"922268453","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chance T","accountLink":"/user/id/922268453"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Splendid, an insightful movie about our society, and is full of social commentary.

The weak and clich√©d plot combined with shameless marketing and awful attempts at humour make this monstrosity nothing more than a bootleg Wreck-It Ralph/The Lego Movie hybrid with half the joy and double the boredom.

The best (it's incredibly difficult to pick one favorite moment/character by the way) is Sir Patrick Stewart's performance of the Poop Emoji, yes THE LEGEND Sir Patrick Stewart. You see, you need the best to be the best so it is understandable they wanted Sir Patrick Stewart, along with the entire cast, for this movie. In conclusion, despite what the critics say about this, it is easily THE movie of 2017, and must be worshipped, or ????, but really this movie was ??????","displayName":"Sabrina M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T17:05:05.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T17:12:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"976587236","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sabrina M","accountLink":"/user/id/976587236"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I just saw the Emoji Movie and I have to say, I don't think I could have gone on living without seeing it.
