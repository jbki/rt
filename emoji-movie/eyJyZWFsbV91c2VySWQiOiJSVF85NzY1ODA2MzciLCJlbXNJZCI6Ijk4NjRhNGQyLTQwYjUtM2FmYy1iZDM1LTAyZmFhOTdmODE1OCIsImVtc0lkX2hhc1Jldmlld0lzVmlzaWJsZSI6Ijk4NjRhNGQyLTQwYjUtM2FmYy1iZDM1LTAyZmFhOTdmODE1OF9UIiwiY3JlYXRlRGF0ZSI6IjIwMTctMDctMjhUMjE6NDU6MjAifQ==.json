You might hear the critics and not want to see this movie but trust me you do. Those critics have no lifes and they wouldn't even know a good movie if it sent them an emoji. The jokes were spot on and no scene lasted for too long at all, including the Just Dance scene.

With the release of the first teaser, the second teaser, and the first official trailer, I could not wait for the day that would go down in history as the release date of the pinnacle achievement of major motion picture creation, July 28th, 2017. Now that I have witnessed God in his true form (AKA Gene), I can tell you heaven is a strange place. \n\nFrom the moment I sat down in the theatre' to the end of the credits, I was in a constant state of flux. The Emoji Movie made me laugh, cry, laugh, and it really toyed with my emotions. SPOILER WARNING especially that scene where Gene turned back into just a plain \"meh.\" My initial reaction was screaming followed by protecting my head from the flying popcorn that my fellow theatergoers were throwing at me. \n\nI hope to see many more Emoji Movies in the wake of its inevitable success (A whole trilogy perhaps) and definitely a Hi-5 Solo Film, as well as a Jailbreak origin story. Then maybe a TV series or two, or a Broadway 1-night performance. Hopefully, in 30 years, we get to witness a new generation of emojis enjoy the limelight that is the cinema, as well as see them pay tribute to the current greats.\n\nThe Emoji Movie certainly isn't the worst movie of all time, despite what its initial reviews might discern. Those who lack audacity will praise movies such as Annie Hall, The Godfather trilogy, and To Kill a Mockingbird as the greatest of all time, however, I say the Emoji Movie is the best movie of all time!\n\n-Dr. Hasne Montoya\nHarvard, Class of 1988","displayName":"Hasné M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T21:20:09.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T21:20:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"976580482","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hasné M","accountLink":"/user/id/976580482"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"If you take 168 (hours in a week) and divide it by 24 (hours in a day), it equals 21. What does it have to do with this movie? It is irrelevant to anything in the universe. It will not impact your life in any way. This movie is in no way, shape, or form creative or educational. Its like watching pbs for the killer porn. I woud rather walk through a field of legos than watch this.
