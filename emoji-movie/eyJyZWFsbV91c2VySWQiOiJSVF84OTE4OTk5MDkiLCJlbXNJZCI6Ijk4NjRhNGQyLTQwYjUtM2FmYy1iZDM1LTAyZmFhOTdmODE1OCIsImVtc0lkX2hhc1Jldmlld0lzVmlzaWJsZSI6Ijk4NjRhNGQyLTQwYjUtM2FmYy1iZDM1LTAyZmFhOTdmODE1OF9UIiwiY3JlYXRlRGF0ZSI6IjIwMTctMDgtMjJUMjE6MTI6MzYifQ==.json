I found it to be very funny and entertaining.  As a software developer I understood many of the references to how a phone can be re-programmed, and how data can be saved and  re-downloaded.  Plus, you have multiple love stories that make you feel for the characters.\n\nThat said, the plot did seem a bit similar to the Lego Movie, which is why this doesn't quite get 5 stars from me.  But I will purchase the Blu-Ray when it comes out and will watch it again multiple times!","displayName":"Kyle R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-22T13:27:16.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-22T13:31:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"976640603","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kyle R","accountLink":"/user/id/976640603"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 22, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Good movie 9/10.

I saw the movie the day of release, and I enjoyed it beyond expectation. This movie, like many others, movie is only good if you think it's going to be. However, the frankly silly basis of the movie made critics think it would be poor, leading them to think it was poor, and leading the average person to think it was poor. And the cycle continues. The Emoji Movie is Sony's best movie this decade, and the hate it gets is unfounded.","displayName":"Mills D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-22T10:36:11.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-22T10:41:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"976640344","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mills D","accountLink":"/user/id/976640344"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 22, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A true masterpiece.

It is one of the most underrated film of all time. I'd say it surpasses the excellence of films such as Star Wars and even all Disney films. The Emoji Movie was so beautifully animated, it brought tears to my eyes. The plot was riveting and I was on the edge of my seat. The character development is superb, especially that of the Poop. The Poop was by far the best character, spectacular design, amazing voice acting, and plot devices far beyond average cinema. The Emoji Movie is so amazing, by far the best film of 2017 and of all time.","displayName":"Milo B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-21T18:51:38.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-21T18:56:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"976639283","realm":"RT","displayName":"Milo B","accountLink":"/user/id/976639283"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 21, 2017"}]}
