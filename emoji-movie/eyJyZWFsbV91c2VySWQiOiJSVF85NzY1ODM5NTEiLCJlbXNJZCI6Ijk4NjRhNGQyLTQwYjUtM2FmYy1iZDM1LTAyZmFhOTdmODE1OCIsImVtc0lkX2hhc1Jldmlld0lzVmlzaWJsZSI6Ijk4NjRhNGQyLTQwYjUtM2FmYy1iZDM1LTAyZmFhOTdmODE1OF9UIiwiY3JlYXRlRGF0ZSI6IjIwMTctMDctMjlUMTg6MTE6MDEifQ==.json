It produces a beautiful and timely score that calls forth all of the emotions that I have put aside. The groundbreaking visuals and masterful storytelling will be woven into the tapestry of all generations, young and old. This entertaining, poignant, and inventive film earns its reputation as a landmark achievement in animated film. I cannot recommend this movie more.","displayName":"Gene K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T18:02:40.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T18:18:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"976583932","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gene K","accountLink":"/user/id/976583932"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A truly heartwarming movie thats filled with moments that give me the hope that God still believes in us.

Don't go in expecting a good time with your kids, you'll come out a completely different person. Your kids won't know you anymore. Your kids will come out thinking they're an emoji, and possessed.
