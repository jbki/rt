You pushed Popeye and Medusa to the wayside for this trash?! I can't believe you! If your goal was to hurt your reputation as a studio, then congratulations! You did it! I hope you're proud of yourself. Oh, and by the way, Sony, I'm being sarcastic when I say I hope you're proud of yourself. I'm sure you probably know that, but then again, you were stupid enough to think that a movie about emojis was a good idea, so it wouldn't surprise me if you're stupid enough to not even know what the definition of sarcasm is. This isn't a movie. This is a tasteless and shameless hour and a half long commercial meant to advertise mobile apps trying to pass itself off as a \"movie\". It's just product placement overload. That's all it is. Skip this garbage and go see something else.","displayName":"Peyton M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-06-18T18:26:02.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-02T19:01:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"963763146","realm":"RT","displayName":"Peyton M","accountLink":"/user/id/963763146"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 18, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"the movie was so great, my ship happens, there is such good character development and tHAT plot twist with jailbreak!1!1!

I found it really hard to get into and its not for a lack of interest in animation I love it. I still watch cartoons till this day, more adult but cartoons none the less. My rating is based upon the fact that it was figured to be funny but I found it to be rather bland in that department. The writing was quite horrible the jokes were increasingly dry and moronic. It needed a lot more work is all I'm saying.","displayName":"Janea L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-06-12T12:07:00.000Z","updateDate":"2017-09-09T13:29:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"898900384","realm":"RT","displayName":"Janea L","accountLink":"/user/id/898900384"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 12, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I saw the ratings then the movie, I thought it was descent, but something everyone needs to remember THIS IS A KIDS MOVIE.
