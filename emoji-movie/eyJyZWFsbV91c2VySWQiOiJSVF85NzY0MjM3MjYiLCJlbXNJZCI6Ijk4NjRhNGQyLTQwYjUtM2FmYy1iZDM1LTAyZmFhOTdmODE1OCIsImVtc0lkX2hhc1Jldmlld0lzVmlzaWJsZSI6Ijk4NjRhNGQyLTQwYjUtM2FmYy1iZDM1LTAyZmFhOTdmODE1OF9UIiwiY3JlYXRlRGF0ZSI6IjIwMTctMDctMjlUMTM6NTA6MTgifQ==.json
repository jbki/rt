I went into this expecting a so-bad-it's-good movie, but what I got was an unfunny, pandering mess with the sole purpose of selling Sony products. The story is a predictable mess, the jokes fall flat, and the characters are all bland versions of other much more interesting and engaging characters. To be fair the animation is bright and colorful. But you can make a piece of shit look as pretty as you want, it's still a piece of shit.","displayName":"James Patrick M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T13:25:43.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T13:25:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"948262758","realm":"RT","displayName":"James Patrick M","accountLink":"/user/id/948262758"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing movie to have your aunt finger your ass hole while watchig","displayName":"nigger j","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T13:25:00.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T13:25:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"976582943","realm":"RT","displayName":"nigger j","accountLink":"/user/id/976582943"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Using gorgeous animation, sweeping music, and ingenious plot devices, this film manages to capture that rare summer magic that makes cinema necessary.","displayName":"Memeb I","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T13:24:18.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T13:29:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"976582939","realm":"RT","displayName":"Memeb I","accountLink":"/user/id/976582939"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"GROUND BREAKING FILM 10/10 IGN WOULD SEE AGAIN","displayName":"Joe V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T13:19:57.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T13:27:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"976582923","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joe V","accountLink":"/user/id/976582923"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"}]}
