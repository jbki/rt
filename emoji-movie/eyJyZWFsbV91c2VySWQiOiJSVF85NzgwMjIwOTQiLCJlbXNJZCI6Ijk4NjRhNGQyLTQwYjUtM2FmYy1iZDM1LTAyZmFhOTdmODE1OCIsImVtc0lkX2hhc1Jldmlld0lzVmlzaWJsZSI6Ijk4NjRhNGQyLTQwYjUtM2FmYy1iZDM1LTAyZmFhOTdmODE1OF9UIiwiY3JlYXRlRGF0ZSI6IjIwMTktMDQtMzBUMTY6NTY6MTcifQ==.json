It's character arks are innovative in the fact that they don't exist.  Their humor is perpendicular to Pixar in that it is all about crap and unfunny as hell.

This movie is one of the best that I've seen in a while. This movie was a gift from the heavens and should be held to a great regard, as this movie is as good as, if not better than classic films, such as Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Full Metal Jacket, Gone with the Wind, Alien, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. This movie is a true blessing. It's changed my life and my marriage. After watching such a cinematic masterpiece, I have entered a new plane and opened my third eye.
