But now I can see it really is FUCKING AWFUL. It really is a massive advertisement. When product placement in a movie seems to take over a spot that character development, plot, and general quality are supposed to occupy in a good movie, you know you have some hot garbage. The only time I laughed during the whole movie is when the credits started to roll and I realized that I just wasted an hour and a half of my life watching \"The Emoji Movie\". The worst part of this movie is the writing. It is so dull and doesn't provoke any thoughts whatsoever like a normal Pixar movie would. I think I would hate this movie more if the animation wasn't the only thing that resembled quality. Do NOT waste your money seeing this steaming pile of shit.","displayName":"Ben W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-17T23:47:02.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-17T23:47:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"974113015","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ben W","accountLink":"/user/id/974113015"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 17, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"the only film that has ever left me without words. possibly the worst film i have ever seen. what good is being number one if there aren't any other numbers?","displayName":"Benjamin F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1485488991/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-17T21:53:46.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-17T21:54:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"841859255","realm":"RT","displayName":"Benjamin F","accountLink":"/user/id/841859255"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 17, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie is terrible, I wanted to leave the theater.

That, or it's nothing more than a desperate money-grab. The premise of the movie is exactly what it sounds like: it's a story wherein the main protagonists are the cartoony figures found in every modern-day texting app: emojis (not to be confused with emoticons, which the movie makes out to be \"the elderly\"). This shtick gets old rather quickly (i.e. in the first couple of minutes), after which the tasteless jokes - if we may even categorise this kind of humour as such - keep coming, one even worse than the other. I never thought any amount of poop jokes could make me suicidal, yet here we are. If awful parodies on pop-culture media are the future for animation movies, then I will gladly never set foot in a theater to review one such films ever again.","displayName":"MovieMew _","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-17T14:24:44.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-18T09:08:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"976628161","realm":"RT","displayName":"MovieMew _","accountLink":"/user/id/976628161"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 17, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I thought it was a cute and funny movie.","displayName":"Tricia  B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-17T14:19:02.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-17T14:19:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"975550171","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tricia  B","accountLink":"/user/id/975550171"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 17, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I expected this movie to bad, but I was wrong.
