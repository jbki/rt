Well then what the fuck is wrong with you because this is easily the best movie of the year. Actually, it's probably the best movie of my lifetime!! This is is the REAL blockbuster of the summer!! Forget about all those other garbage movies and spend all your money on this one. This is the movie that no one asked for, but that everyone deserves! Jesus, what can I really say about it? Well, for starters, the cast was amazing. I mean, having Sir Patrick Stewart playing the poop emoji was just comedy gold right there!! And TJ miller? OMG if he is not nominated for an Oscar for this tear-jerking performance then I don't know what he else he could do. The plot, the score, the characters uhhhhhh ?. I had a full erection the entire movie and it didn't go away until the screen turned black. I have now seen the movie 3 times and my GF said if I go again she's gonna break up with. But what the fuck does she expect me to do?         IT'S THE EMOJI MOVIE!!! Overall, I give this movie 10 emojis out of 10. It's just a showcase of how far we have come in cinema to create such a masterpiece as this one. Truly one of a kind.","displayName":"Andrew W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T23:21:32.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T23:23:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"972431978","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew W","accountLink":"/user/id/972431978"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie was so horrendous that it almost made me commit suicide and buy Postal 3 while getting food from Chitpole filled with feces. This movies carcass is as intoxicated as the polluted dead ones of this land. I rather drown my corpse in a pool of  blood and tears\n. I'd rather  watch that horrible sjw Ghostbusters than this cancer this, filth of the Earth. This  needs to be sent out and departed from this plain of existence. This universal abnormal abomination needs to be corrected well abhored and eradicates it whole.  I rather suck on Tiddus' laughing nipples than this pg abomniation that will never understand the internet and it's full grasp. This will be the movie that kills Sony. Spiderman Homecoming was the appetizer of it and the emoji is the possible climax/finale. Now don't watch this movie it will feast your eyes and evaporate your flesh like a Mongolian deathworm. There is no God's there is only darkness brought on the twilight of this disease we call the Emoji Movie. A moment where history was stolen of it's helpless adolescence . The day of eternal storm of darkness. It must end in negative reviews. Keep in mind this isn't 2003 Hulk it is much worse , so much worse , it is even worse than Boko No Piku. Never watch the Emoji Movie it will pilfer your soul and pillage your innocence","displayName":"Tate M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T23:19:44.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T23:58:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"976580875","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tate M","accountLink":"/user/id/976580875"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Worst movie made ever","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/293518387783451/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T23:17:06.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T23:17:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"976580874","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976580874"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"the fact that this movie was actually made makes me want to fucking stab the middle aged man who thought this was a good fucking idea.","displayName":"mr w","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T23:12:17.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T23:15:47.000Z","user":{"userId":"976580865","realm":"RT","displayName":"mr w","accountLink":"/user/id/976580865"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best.
