Where do I begin? The Emoji Movie is a cinematic masterpiece filled with well thought out and perfectly timed puns. There were a handful of jokes that would go over a child's head, but bring a smile to anyone else's face. \nEven though I loved it, I do have some complaints about their app choices. The app Just Dance is not a popular enough reference. The wii game for Just Dance is something anyone will recognize, but the phone app is only recently available as it is new to further promote the Emoji Movie. In the Spotify app, the emojis ride on sound waves most commonly associated with SoundCloud. In my opinion SoundCloud would have been a better app for that scene. The YouTube scene was spot on and even included random suggested videos. The Candy Crush scene was shown in the trailers, but it was lacking in substance. Candy Crush is an outdated game that is played mainly by moms and not teenagers such as Alex, the owner of the phone the movie takes place in. The piracy app was comedic gold. The use of spam and online trolls was perfectly executed. \nThe movie fits perfectly between the categories of video game films and comedy films. The cookie cutter plot with the sprinkle of romance between to unlikely friends on a journey of self discovery makes the Emoji Movie into an exquisite family film.\nBeneath the surface of the emoticon themed movie lies many themes that should be addressed in many films and television shows for children. These themes include: self acceptance, gender equality, and of course that real friendships mean the most in life. \nThe main character experiences self doubt at the beginning due to his quirkiness and sets out to change himself, but in the end, his off-color personality is what saves Textopolis from being destroyed.\nJailbreak is a female emoji who wants to leave the phone (break the glass ceiling) and live her life without conforming to her society's expectations that women must be princesses or brides. (We must keep in mind that this movie was already in production before the new set of female emojis was released.)\nThe character Hi-5 wishes to become a favorite emoji again and win back his fans, but after discovering his new friendships are more important than fame, he realizes that's all he needs to be happy. \nThe animation was very fluid and the concept was extremely creative and put together quite well. The voice actors were truly excellent and displayed their emojion perfectly. \nThere is no doubt that the Emoji Movie will become a family favorite and a huge success.","displayName":"Emily R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-27T22:47:37.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-27T22:48:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"976576406","realm":"RT","displayName":"Emily R","accountLink":"/user/id/976576406"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 27, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"HONESTLY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOVIE TO EVER EXIST I AM DABBIN ON THEM HATERS.
