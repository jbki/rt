The best adjective I could find to fit this movie perfectly was 'Tolerable.' If you are a parent and watching this with your kids, prepare yourself. But it won't matter in a week because this movie is so forgettable. It wasn't 'funny' or entertaining, in fact the entire time I watched it, I felt uncomfortable.

The idea of making a movie about emoji could be fresh and attractive but it clearly did not brought all the potential power in that topic - though I can sense they are at least trying. As for the boring story line and rotten plots, well I have watched enough cartoon movie to give it a go. I mean, come on, just how many movies from even Disney make you feel totally fresh these years? What I think the largest problem is that they did not even try to hide the greedy intension of marketing apps. You want to make money, fine, but can you please try not to smash your commercials in our face in all the unnecessary points? Finally, I would like to say this: do you REALLY think emojis are these icon formats you used? Come on, try to look up to the ASC-II kind of emojis, especially the ones used daily by Japanese people. Now THAT is what emoji really means! If you don't understand that, you can never get the most interesting part of emoji world.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2091455027601976/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-23T07:55:48.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-23T08:05:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"977750239","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977750239"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVERRRRRRRR ITS SO GOOD I LOVED IT WHEN THEY WENT INSIDE OF YOUTUBE AND WATCHED MY FAVORITE YOUTUBE VIDEO EVER PPAP ALSO LOVED THE DANCE PARTY AND THE EMD I GOT OUT OF MY SEAT AND STARTED DANCING IN THE THEATER I WISH I COULD GIVE IT MORE THAN 5 STARS BUT I CANTðŸ˜­","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-21T09:45:50.850Z","updateDate":"2019-01-21T09:45:50.850Z","user":{"userId":"972709612","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/972709612"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"...The longest ad I've ever seen...","displayName":"Volt G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-19T14:16:29.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-19T14:16:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"977078117","realm":"RT","displayName":"Volt G","accountLink":"/user/id/977078117"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 19, 2019"}]}
