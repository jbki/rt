Fuckin emoji bullshit, the fuck is this pile of fuck? Everyone who worked on this movie is a cunt that needs to be fucking tortured to death. I'm not joking, I literally believe that the people who made this ass-eating retarded-ass fuck of a movie needs to be shipped off to Syria, tortured by terrorists, then killed after weeks of painful torture and then have their bodies dumped in a backed-up sewer because the only place the fuckers who made this shit-fucking donkey-raping ass of a movie is back in the cellspool of shit and toxic waste from whence they came! Everyone who works at Sony needs to get raped up the ass by Satan himself as punishment for working for the company that not just made this sickening piss-bucket, but actually thought it was a good idea in the first place. I'd tell the Emoji Movie to burn in hell, but not even the souls of the damned deserve to be near this dingleberry that came out of Adolf Hitler's hairy shit-stained ass crack. Speaking of Hitler, if I had to choose between going back in time and letting Hitler win World War 2, or simply letting the Emoji movie continue to exist, I'd choose the first option. Not even Hitler's gas chambers can touch the noxious ass-fart that is The Emoji Movie.","displayName":"Greg S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T20:20:52.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T20:28:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"976584312","realm":"RT","displayName":"Greg S","accountLink":"/user/id/976584312"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Wholly vapid, the worst film this year.

I can, however, think of an emoji, and it's รฐ' (C) (who is voiced by Sir Patrick Stewart, might I add). \n\nWith everything this movie does WRONG, there is one glaring issue I have with it - the complete lack of รฐ~ยฌ emoji, because that's exactly how it made me feel. \n\nDon't let the half star fool you, folks. By all accounts this movie scores a perfect zero across the board.","displayName":"Mark C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/664351337/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T20:09:20.000Z","updateDate":"2017-12-20T14:03:01.000Z","user":{"userId":"873237696","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mark C","accountLink":"/user/id/873237696"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie was so bad that I have sworn off ALL products made by Sony. I will never use a single Sony electronic or buy anything with the Sony brand on it again. \n\nTAKE THAT, SONY! Your pathetic little attempt to advertise yourself with this feature-length commercial only made me and everyone I know decide to swear off all things Sony forever. I hope this movie flops and you lose money on this, Sony! Also, all of the people in this list deserve to be fired and blacklisted so they'll never work in entertainment again: \n1. Whomever pitched this pathetic excuse for a movie. \n2. Whomever greenlit this waste of time. \n3. The director \n4. The executive producer(s) \n5. The so-called \"writers\" of the \"script\". \n\nI can write a better script by wiping my ass. Fuck this movie, fuck you, Sony, and fuck everyone involved in this pathetic, disgusting, deplorable, hideous excuse for a movie that should be banned from theaters. I'm usually for free speech, but this sickening sack of shit needs to be banned because it is a biohazard. The nearest cinema to my house is seven miles away and I can still smell the toxic sewage sludge that is this movie from here.","displayName":"Kat M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T20:03:15.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T20:08:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"976584267","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kat M","accountLink":"/user/id/976584267"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I decided to kill myself after watching this piece of shit.","displayName":"Victoria E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T19:59:04.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T20:13:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"976584256","realm":"RT","displayName":"Victoria E","accountLink":"/user/id/976584256"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The Emoji Movie is about as clever as a teenager sitting around looking at his phone all day which results in a lazy, joyless, unfunny, and desperate attempt at family entertainment that should only be approached with extreme caution!","displayName":"Nico B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T19:55:40.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-04T17:01:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"905445336","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nico B","accountLink":"/user/id/905445336"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This brilliantly told tale shows in great capacity the ability of man and machine to synchronize while also having their problems. The protagonist emoji (Gene) and the protagonist human (Alex) show many similarities throughout the film, struggling to fit in and being constantly expected to suppress their emotions due to social ideals. Through the ride of the film you follow you character and friends on their quest to fit in and find happiness while throughout the whole movie it was in them all along, all they had to do was express it. The humor is tasteful and never gets old, references that not all get makes you keep watching until the end. In the end this movie is a great thing to look back on when you need to be brave and show who you truly are while adding some comedic relief. ??/?? would watch again????????","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/494118920922764/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T19:54:37.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T20:02:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"976584241","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976584241"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"What the fuck, The Room has a better review then this","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1494551923938824/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T19:48:36.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T19:49:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"976584225","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976584225"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"}]}
