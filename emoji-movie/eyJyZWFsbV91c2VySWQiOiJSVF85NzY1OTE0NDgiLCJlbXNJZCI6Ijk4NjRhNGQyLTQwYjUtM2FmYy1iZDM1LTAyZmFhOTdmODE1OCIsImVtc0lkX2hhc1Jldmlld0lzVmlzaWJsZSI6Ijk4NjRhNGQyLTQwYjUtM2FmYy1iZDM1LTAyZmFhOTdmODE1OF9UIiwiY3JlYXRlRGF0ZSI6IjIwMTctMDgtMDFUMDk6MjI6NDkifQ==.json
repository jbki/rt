This film explores the modern day struggles of not fitting in while trying to be something you're not. This film includes pop culture references that are delightful and music from Christina Aguilera. Emoji movie proves to have heart and substance whilst bringing emoji users of all ages together with whimsy and social bravery.","displayName":"Haley F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-01T08:17:05.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-01T08:21:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"976591328","realm":"RT","displayName":"Haley F","accountLink":"/user/id/976591328"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 01, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Oh it's a character who has problems fitting in finds a person who shares their beliefs and go on a quest to find out that it's what's on the inside that counts. Why is this the only plot that Hollywood things kids will enjoy why? Also the writing is atrocious so Hollywood from the dearest part of my heart please for the love of God stop trying to be hip. So besides bad writing, a plot that is so overused, and makes good actors and actresses look horrible you'd think you were watching current day Family Guy and I would much rather watch that than this piece of crap.","displayName":"Chris%20 G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-01T08:03:45.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-01T08:12:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"976591316","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris%20 G","accountLink":"/user/id/976591316"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 01, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie was a god damn awful movie on all ends.
