My mom convinced me to watch it with her ironically. It's kind of funny how the movie is about emojis, derived from the word emotions, because I felt nothing after witnessing this train wreck. I swear I went to school the next day and just didn't talk the whole day because this movie drained every last bit of happiness from my soul.
