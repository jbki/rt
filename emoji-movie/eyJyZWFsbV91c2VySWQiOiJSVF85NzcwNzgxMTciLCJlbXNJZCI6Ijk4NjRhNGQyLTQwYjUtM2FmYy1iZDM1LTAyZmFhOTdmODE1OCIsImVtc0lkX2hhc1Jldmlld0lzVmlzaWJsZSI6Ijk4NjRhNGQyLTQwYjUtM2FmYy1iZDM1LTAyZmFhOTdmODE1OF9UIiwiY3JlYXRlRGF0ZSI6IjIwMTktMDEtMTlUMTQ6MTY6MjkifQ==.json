It was so obvious that it's embarrassing. I didn't care about any of the characters especially with the main character and his so called annoying friend. \nIt's also teaches kids lessons that they should honestly never learn . What's the message the film was trying to receive?  You don't wanna know, but if you really wanna know: \nSPOILERS: The message the film is trying to receive is the way to win someone is to send a emoji.    \nIt was so face palming that i started to wonder why i loved animation.\nSo yeah don't support this film, and don't show this film to your kids.","displayName":"Jesse%20 M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-01-11T21:44:36.000Z","updateDate":"2019-01-13T22:07:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"977724513","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jesse%20 M","accountLink":"/user/id/977724513"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jan 11, 2019"}]}
