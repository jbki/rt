A country run by soldiers does sound like an awesome thing. Anyone who doesn't like this game hasn't played it yet. Portable Ops actually has a decent story. Wait not that Gene? Oh the Emoji Movie? I mean it's plot is meh, but I was genuinely excited to see the new types of enviroments the Emojis travel to. Some parts of the plot don't make sense. Mostly boring and forced product placement. Looking at you Just Dance and Candy Crush. The humor is also trash. If you are a Jacksfilms fan, I mean uh 10/10 best movie evar.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/132299297368971/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T17:59:04.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T18:08:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"976579821","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976579821"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"THE Cinematic event of the year. if you don't see The Emoji movie and don;t see pure genius, then you are not a true movie fan or critic.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/335670510209679/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T17:59:00.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T17:59:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"976579819","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976579819"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Jacksfilms, the hype was real","displayName":"Bella H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T17:57:16.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T17:57:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"929585523","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bella H","accountLink":"/user/id/929585523"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is beyond generic. It is so fucking clear that they are trying to make it as mass-appealing as possible. The plot is very predictable, and has the most feel good overused \"be yourself\" message that has gotten all too old. There are many unfunny relatable jokes and pop culture references to try to make it even more appealing to the general public, such as PPAP (a video designed for 10 year olds to find funny because \"Random\"), the youtube cat video stereotype (which hasn't been true since 2008), Candy Crush, and Just Dance. The characters are equally as bad, such as the hand emoji, who is supposed to be the wacky silly comic relief but is just an annoying character that acts like a stereotypical gay guy. Jailbreak is even more generic, as she is supposed to be the token \"Girl Power\" character. However, she is more of just an attempt to get young girls to find a cool edgy character to relate to, which I guess isn't that bad, but it's just so clear that that was the only goal of the people making the movie, to make a stereotypical edgy cool girl. I have no complaints with Sir Patrick Stewart's character, as he was so thicc that I had to take a huge breather in the middle of the film. As for Gene, he was just your average happy kids movie protagonist, really very basic and generic, just like the rest of the movie. I felt absolutely no connection to most of the boring characters in this movie. And the worst part about this movie is probably the fact that it is about emojis. If that doesn't scream cash-grab to you, I don't know what does.\n\nOverview: this is the best hentai I've ever seen me me big boy. Anyone who has told you that they didn't nut while watching gene and jailbreak dance is a coldhearted liar. July 28 shall go down in history as the greatest step forwards to ever happen in the history of humanity.","displayName":"EMOJI M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T17:56:52.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T18:25:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"976579811","realm":"RT","displayName":"EMOJI M","accountLink":"/user/id/976579811"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Cinematic masterpiece","displayName":"Camryn L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T17:55:30.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T17:55:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"964759129","realm":"RT","displayName":"Camryn L","accountLink":"/user/id/964759129"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"REALLY GOOD!
