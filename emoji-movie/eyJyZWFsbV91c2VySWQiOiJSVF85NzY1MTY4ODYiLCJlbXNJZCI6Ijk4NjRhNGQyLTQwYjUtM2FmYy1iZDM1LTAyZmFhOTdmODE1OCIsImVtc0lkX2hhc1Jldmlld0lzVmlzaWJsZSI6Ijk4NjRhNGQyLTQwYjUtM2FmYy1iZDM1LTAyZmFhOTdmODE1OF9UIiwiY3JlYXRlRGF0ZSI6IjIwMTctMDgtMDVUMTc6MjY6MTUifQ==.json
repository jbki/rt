What I didn't expect however, was just how much it exceeded my expectations. This, by far, was the worst movie I have ever seen. The animation was crappy at best, none of the jokes were funny, the script was cliche, cheesy and rushed. The plot was basic and stereotypical. They obviously 'tried' not to make it like that, but fell on their faces in shame. The only people in the theater who laughed were the parents who took their kids with them, those trying to make the kids laugh. Me and my friends wanted to see it just to know how bad it was. Don't make this mistake. We had to drown our sorrows in frozen yogurt after, and still have not fully recovered. I had to delete the emoji keyboard it was so bad. Don't give them your money. If I could give less than half a star, it would be sitting at -300.","displayName":"Castiel E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-05T16:19:06.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-05T16:29:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"976598686","realm":"RT","displayName":"Castiel E","accountLink":"/user/id/976598686"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 05, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"It was so bad I wish I could die, the sad part is I was already dead inside.
