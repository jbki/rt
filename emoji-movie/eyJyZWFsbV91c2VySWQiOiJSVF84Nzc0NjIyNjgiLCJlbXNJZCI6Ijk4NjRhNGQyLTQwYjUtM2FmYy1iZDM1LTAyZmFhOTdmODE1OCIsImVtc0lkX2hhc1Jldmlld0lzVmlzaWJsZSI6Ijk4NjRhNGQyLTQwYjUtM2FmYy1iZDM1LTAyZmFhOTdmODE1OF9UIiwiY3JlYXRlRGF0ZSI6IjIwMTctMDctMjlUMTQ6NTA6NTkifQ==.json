If I could change anything it would probably be the poop jokes. In the first 10 there are only 5 poop jokes. If it were up to me there would be around 20. One joke that is probably my favorite is gene walks up to a clock and asked if that was the time and the clock replied with \"Hey my eyes are up here\". They go through some apps and it's so in touch. They go through Candy Crush and everyone plays Candy Crush. Then they go to Just Dance and Spotify and Dance to relevant songs like Watch me Whip! Then Genes parents go to YouTube and the most popular video on the web  right now, Pen Pineapple Apple Pen, is shown to represent it. Over all the story is top notch and I don't think this has ever been used before. And of course you can't have a movie if it doesn't end with a giant Dance Party and everyone is happy in the end. Now for spoilers. Jail Break and Gene don't fuck. Never and the sexual tension is so strong and it's never explained why they don't fuck. But if you want to see sexual tension and a completely original story, I suggest go now because god knows they will pull from theaters in a week","displayName":"Brendan H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1786941458252636/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T14:43:05.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T14:43:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"974928299","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brendan H","accountLink":"/user/id/974928299"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is a super funny movie that cured mu crippling depression.

But that was not the case.  I took my 3 children ranging from ages 5-7 & they loved it.  I enjoyed the movie - what these critics or trolls seem to forget is that this s a movie for children not for these negative people who went in to see it hating it for no apparent reason.  Do not allow these negative reviews stop you from taking your kids to see it as they will thoroughlt enjoy it.  I had to promise my kids we would get it on DVD when it comes out.  So to all those who panned it get off the negatve bandwagon & look at the movie through the eyes of the kids that are watching it.  This is a feel good movie for kids so take your kids to see it & leave those negative lies at the doors,, We LOVED it!!","displayName":"Crystal S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T14:37:29.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T15:36:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"976583199","realm":"RT","displayName":"Crystal S","accountLink":"/user/id/976583199"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is the best movie I have seen by far.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1174936269278138/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T14:37:26.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T14:38:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"976583198","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976583198"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Basically wreck it Ralph but it was amaze","displayName":"uprisermichael","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T14:33:53.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T14:33:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"974335397","realm":"RT","displayName":"uprisermichael","accountLink":"/user/id/974335397"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Do not, and I repeat do not listen to any of the critics reviews. It was SO funny, and by far the best movie ever. Great fun for literally everyone. I am 13 and went to the movie with my friend Matt and the whole theater of like 20 or so people was laughing the whole time, including me and my friend. The age range was from I'd say like 8- over 50. So yeah, everyone will find it funny. Those other reviews from so called \"critics\" are completely fake and are just from people who don't know how to have fun, and are just the type of people that sit there alone in a theater, supposed to review the movie, wondering where the jokes are because they don't understand any of them because they don't know what REAL jokes are! Please don't listen to any of those people. I rate the emoji movie 6 stars! If you are looking for a funny movie that kids and parents will like that is Very FAMILY FRIENDLY then go to this one. I swear, you will not be disappointed. So yeah, I repeat this movie is #1out of all movies ever! Go watch it!","displayName":"Ben S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T14:26:44.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T14:36:54.000Z","user":{"userId":"976583161","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ben S","accountLink":"/user/id/976583161"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Despite everyone awful review, I will say this was a good entertaining movie.
