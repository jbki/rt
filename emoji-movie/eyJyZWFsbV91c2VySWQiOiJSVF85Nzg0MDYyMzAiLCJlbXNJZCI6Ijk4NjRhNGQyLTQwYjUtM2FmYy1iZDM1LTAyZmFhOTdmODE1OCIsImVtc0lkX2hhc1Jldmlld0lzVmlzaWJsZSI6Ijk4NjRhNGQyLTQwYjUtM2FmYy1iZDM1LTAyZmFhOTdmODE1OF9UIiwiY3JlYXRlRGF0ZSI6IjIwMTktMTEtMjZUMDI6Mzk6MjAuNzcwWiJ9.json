But this movie is ungodly horrible not just because it's a boring, cliche, lazy excuse for a movie, but because this movie actually changed the landscape of the entertainment industry, in the worst way possible. It lowered the bar for what soulless, cheap, product placement monstrosities could be accepted and made by massive entertainment studios. It's technically not the worst movie ever made but it's one of the most hate able movies ever, and it goes against everything that make movies great. Overall, it's a disgusting movie and you shouldn't give your money to the hacks who made it.","displayName":"Aidan  R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T23:01:22.398Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T23:05:15.217Z","user":{"userId":"978217412","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aidan  R","accountLink":"/user/id/978217412"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This was actually not that bad.
