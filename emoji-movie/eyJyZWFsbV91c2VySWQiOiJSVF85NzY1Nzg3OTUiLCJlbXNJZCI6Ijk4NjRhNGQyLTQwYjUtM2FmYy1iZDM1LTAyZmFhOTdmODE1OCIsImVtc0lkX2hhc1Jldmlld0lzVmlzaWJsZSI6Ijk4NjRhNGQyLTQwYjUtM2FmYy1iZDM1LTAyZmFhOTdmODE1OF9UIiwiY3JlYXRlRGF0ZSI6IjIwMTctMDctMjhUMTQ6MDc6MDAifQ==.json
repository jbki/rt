It's exceptional characters, glorious soundtrack, and brilliant humor all add to the beautiful love story between Gene and Jailbreak. The lesson taught in this film is something new and fresh, which is that you do not need to fit in to be important. I would put this film up there with the Godfather trilogy. Congrats to Sony Pictures on creating one of the most brilliant masterpieces in recent memory.","displayName":"Jack S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T14:06:57.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T14:11:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"976578794","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jack S","accountLink":"/user/id/976578794"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The Emoji Movie (2017) is \"The Godfather\" of animated films. This Hollywood blockbuster follows Jean, a meh emoji. Jean lives in the world of emojis, where everyone is supposed to act the same way. But there's one problem. Jean has more than one emotion. Sometimes he can be laughing, crying or a mixture of both instead of just meh. \n      I have 2 major problems with this movie. The first, and bigger of the two is that it has the same story-line as other animated films like Wreck-It Ralph. The protagonist is expected to act one way, but he/she does not oblige. If The Emoji Movie had it's own unique taste and story, it would be higher than a 3.5 coming from me. My second problem is the inconsistent quality of jokes throughout the movie. The churlish poop jokes were quite funny, but some other ones I can't wrap my head around. An example is when Jean, the main protagonist asks a shrimp emoji what his plans are for the day. The shrimp emoji tells Jean he's gonna throw himself on the Barbie, and throws himself on the Barbie. \n       It is the those two reasons and many other nit-picky details that lead to me giving this close to amazing movie 4/5 stars.","displayName":"Nate C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T14:06:31.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T14:19:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"976410715","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nate C","accountLink":"/user/id/976410715"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This just beat out no country for old men as my 2nd favorite movie of all time only behind the emoji movie 2.
