The storyline isn't horrible, it was the execution that was miserable. There are also a few moments in the movie that made me question whether or not this truly should be a 'kids' movie. It's not too hard to make a movie that appeals to both kids and adults the same, but The Emoji Movie shows us how to try to appeal to both, fall flat on their face, and make it look easy. There was also some major sloppiness animation-wise at the end of the movie, there was one scene at the end where they just stopped making the character talk he was just talking and no mouth movement. Made me scoff and shake my head at how lazy some people can get in show business. In conclusion: Emoji Movie is a cheesy, horrible, cringe-fest that was an absolute major dud and I feel bad for anybody who paid to see this atrocity. \n\nMovie about emojis","displayName":"Josh B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-31T07:08:47.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-31T07:20:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"976588737","realm":"RT","displayName":"Josh B","accountLink":"/user/id/976588737"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 31, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Worst movie of maybe ever","displayName":"Cyrus%20 A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-31T07:00:53.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-31T07:01:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"976588718","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cyrus%20 A","accountLink":"/user/id/976588718"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 31, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"In reality this might strike a kids eye as emojis are the hottest thing on the internet In reality this movie was one big cash grab I went to watch it with my cousin and we both HATED it the movie was so bland like nothing was put to thought into this movie and was horrible gene did not have much character or hi-5 jailbreak was okay but was not able to make this movie redeemable in reality if you want to see a better movie watch stuff like home alone 2 or wreck it ralph those were good and fine movies this movie is just another sony tryhard and can never redeem sony as a movie company","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/302652940138424/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-31T06:36:47.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-31T06:43:34.000Z","user":{"userId":"976588675","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976588675"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 31, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie cured my cancer, by giving me mega-cancer","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1890653664520316/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-31T06:17:25.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-31T06:17:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"976588660","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976588660"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 31, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The Emoji Movie was a perfect movie, comedic, deep, saddening, and so beautiful.
