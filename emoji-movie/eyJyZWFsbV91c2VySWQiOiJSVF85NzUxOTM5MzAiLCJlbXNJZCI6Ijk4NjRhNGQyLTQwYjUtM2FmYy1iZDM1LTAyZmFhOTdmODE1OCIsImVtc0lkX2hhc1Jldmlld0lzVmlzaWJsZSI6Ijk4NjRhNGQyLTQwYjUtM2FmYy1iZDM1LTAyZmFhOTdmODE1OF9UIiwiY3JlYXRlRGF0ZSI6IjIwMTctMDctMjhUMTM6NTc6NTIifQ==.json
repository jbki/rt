Do not listen to the other critics who rate it only as \"meh\" for they could not see true artistry if it hit them in the face.

And I've seen people die. Stay far away from this film, don't even see it ironically, even if its the worst thing you've ever seen, they still get their money and that may warrant a sequel in their eyes. Everyone knows sequels are worse than the originals, and a film worse than this might tear a hole in time in space. Don't waste your short time on this earth witnessing this \"film\". Donate the $15 you would spend on this movie to charity. I know many of you are giving it five star reviews, as inspired by jacksfilms, but, seriously. Don't give this film any credit, god forbid somebody sees \"46%\" and goes to see it, and enough people do that and we get a sequel.","displayName":"Shane%20 F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T13:51:52.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T13:53:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"976577374","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shane%20 F","accountLink":"/user/id/976577374"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was honestly the best movie I've ever watched.
