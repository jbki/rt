The stark animation and brilliant score are sublime in their simplicity. A truly unique perspective and never-before explored insight of an untouched emoticon universe; erected to provoke curiosity in viewers, it extends far beyond the realm of fiction and surpasses the threshold between mere fantasy and scientific wonder. To whomever believes that this movie deserves a feeble 8%, you obviously do not have the academic capabilities to appreciate the silent yet deafening depth of this film. The film shows the complex communicative nuances among society through a non-lingual medium. Most viewers cannot recognize the depth of this highly conceptual art; the seemingly base nature of the film separates the truly devoted viewers from those who seek shallow entertainment. This is what makes the Emoji Movie a cinematic masterpiece and a revolutionary art form few can appreciate.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/220150141930395/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-25T20:38:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-25T20:55:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"977335273","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977335273"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 25, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie makes using the TV as a baby sitter look like a responsible parenting decision.
