The emoji movie has stolen elements from successful movies like Wreck it Ralph, The Lego movie, Inside out.

See, my family's favorite thing to do is watch movies. My family bought tickets to the  Emoji Movie. The movie brought tears to my eyes... Sir Patrick Stewart reminded me of the good old days of Star Trek. With such characters as \"Meh\", \"Hi-5\", \"Jailbreak\", \"Smiler\", \"Poop\", and \"Eggplant\", nothing could be so amazing. The movie finished, and I stood up, wiping away my tears. We got back from the movie, and my grandma was free of her cancer. My grandmother owes her life to the Emoji Movie, and to that I say thank you.","displayName":"Jeff K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T18:18:37.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T18:28:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"976583930","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jeff K","accountLink":"/user/id/976583930"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"was one of the worst movies i ever experienced in my entire life! was dragged in by my friend","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/750362908499970/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T18:11:01.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T18:11:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"976583951","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976583951"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"}]}
