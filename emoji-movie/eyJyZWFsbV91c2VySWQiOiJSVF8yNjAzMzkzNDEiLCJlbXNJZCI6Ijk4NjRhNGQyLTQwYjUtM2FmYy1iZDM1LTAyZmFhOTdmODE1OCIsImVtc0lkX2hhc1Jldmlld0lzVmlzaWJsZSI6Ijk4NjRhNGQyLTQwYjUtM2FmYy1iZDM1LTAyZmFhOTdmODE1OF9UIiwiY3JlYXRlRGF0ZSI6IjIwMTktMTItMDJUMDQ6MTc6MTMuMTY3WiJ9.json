The film has oscar worthy animation, acting, and writing to the point where after you watch the film once, you leave as a different person entirely. The film is so immersive that even the youngest of toddlers can tell that the creators of this film have poured there heart and soul into it and easily the magnum opus of Sony Pictures Animation. The Humor is also absolutely amazing, it feels like the writers of the jokes were written by Jimmy Kimmel himself and a group of people who use Reddit daily, I laughed at the film until my lungs were completely numb. This film is the only stance between creative freedom and the overly controlled corporate minds of Disney and Pixar, i rate this film a 10 out of 10, what an absolute masterpiece, my god.","displayName":"pablo h","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T22:24:44.596Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T22:24:44.596Z","user":{"userId":"978414778","realm":"RT","displayName":"pablo h","accountLink":"/user/id/978414778"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"If you are thinking about seeing this movie, know that you are making a big mistake","displayName":"Cal G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-01T04:06:25.662Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T04:06:25.662Z","user":{"userId":"978363962","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cal G","accountLink":"/user/id/978363962"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"ass. my favorite part was the end to all emojis those assholes shouldn't live. nobody in the theater clapped or chreered when the movie ended","displayName":"Jacoby H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/614586975948065/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-12-01T03:36:18.912Z","updateDate":"2019-12-01T03:36:18.912Z","user":{"userId":"978413504","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jacoby H","accountLink":"/user/id/978413504"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"it's a good movie dont know why theres so much negative reviews ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T18:09:11.626Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T18:09:11.626Z","user":{"userId":"260333150","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260333150"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It's either you like be it or hate it movie and I love it there were only two scenes u didn't like and those were the YouTube scene and the scene where Gene breaks the cubes outside of that it was amazing and awesome I get if you hate it for multiple reasons so I'm not sad but what I am dissapointed about was HOW ON EARTH DID IT GET A 7 THIS MOVIE AT LEAST SHOULD GET A 50 I WIULD GIVE IT A 92 TO 97 BUT A 7 REALLY THERE CAN'T BE THAT MANY PEOPLE THAT HATE THIS MOVIE","displayName":"Shawn R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/514967895990100/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T16:53:33.237Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T16:53:33.237Z","user":{"userId":"978285344","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shawn R","accountLink":"/user/id/978285344"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Worst movie in the whole world hope it donâ€™t get a part 2 0/10","displayName":"Jayden","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-29T19:29:13.327Z","updateDate":"2019-11-29T19:29:13.327Z","user":{"userId":"62E859FE-91A3-4B35-9200-9069BA6F546A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jayden","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Changed the way I look at life itself.
