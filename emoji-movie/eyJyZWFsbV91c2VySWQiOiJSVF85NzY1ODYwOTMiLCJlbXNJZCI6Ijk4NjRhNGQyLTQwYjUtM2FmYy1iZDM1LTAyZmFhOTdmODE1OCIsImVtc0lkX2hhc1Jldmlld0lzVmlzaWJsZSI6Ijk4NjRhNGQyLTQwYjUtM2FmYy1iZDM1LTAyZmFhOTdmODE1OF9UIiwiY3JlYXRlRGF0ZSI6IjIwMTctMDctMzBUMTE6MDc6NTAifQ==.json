The plot's premise os overused and contrived, the feature's feeble attempts at comedy fall flat 99% of the time, with only one or two jokes actually being coherent. The movie's (if you can even call it that, it's more like a commercial) very existence is dated, and will most likely feel even worse viewing it in five to ten years from now, than it does now. The line \"Emojis are the most important form of communication.\" is a line that is actually said in this movie...and I weep for humanity. The BEST thing I can say about this movie is that Sir Patrick Stewart voices a piece of poop with a white bowtie, so I can make even smarter poop jokes after the movie, than the movie made itself.\n\nWhen I went to go see this movie on opening night (I didn't waste my money, my friend did), I was met with one good thing: The opening Hotel Transylvania short.  It was fun, had nice jokes, and was reminiscent of an old Looney Tunes short, which I appreciated. So let this be a note to all future filmmakers and Hollywood executives: If the animated two minute short before your fifty million dollar big wig production (because we all know this wasn't a creative endeavor), then YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG...but what do I know, i'm just a crotchety asshole.\n\nI think the worst thing about this movie, is that I'm pretty sure it's probably still going to make it's money back, maybe even make a profit...and that is not productive for Hollywood. They need to know they've done wrong, and if this movie makes it's money back or makes a profit, they will learn all the wrong lessons from it. If this movie makes money, then they will simply say \"Oh, people liked this movie, we should make more like it. GREEN LIGHT THE FIDGET SPINNER ROMANTIC COMEDY WE'VE HAD ON THE BACKBURNER FOR THREE DAYS.\". I can't stand that, and considering the audience score, people are just going to chalk this up to critics not knowing what they're talking about. \"Oh it's just a movie for kids, turn your brain off and enjoy it.\" they'll say...no, your kids deserve better, and we deserve better as a moviegoing audience.\n\nNo, actually, you know what? It making it's money back isn't the worst thing. The worst thing about this movie is that it treats it's audience demographic like complete and utter imbeciles. If your kid can't go to a movie and learn something about life or gain some personality from it, then it isn't a movie you should be taking your kid to. This is shapes and colors, noise and nonsense, and if you think the movie is good enough because it's distracting your child for an hour and thirty-one minutes, then you're not a good person or a good parent. Children deserve to be treated with intelligence, especially when it comes to the media they consume on a daily basis. But sadly, that's not the world we live in these days. No, parents would rather take their kid to see \"The Emoji Movie\" and have them complain about needing to take a piss for the duration of it, just to shut up and go braindead when they see the little jaundice ridden TJ Miller sphere's parents go into the YouTube app for fifteen minutes...this movie is a tragedy, and I weep for anyone who had to work on it.\n\nDon't take your kids to see this movie, don't take them to go see Despicable Me 3. In my opinion, they're both bad, and the only movie you should be taking your little kids to right now is Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie, Wonder Woman, or Spider-Man: Homecoming. If you found this good, I will judge you as harshly as I judge those who enjoyed Suicide Squad, and you as a person, not just a moviegoer have lost my respect.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/977831888943158/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T09:47:20.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T10:13:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"976585877","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976585877"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Garbage Movie made by Garbage People.","displayName":"John E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1397306902/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T09:39:19.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T09:41:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"898494298","realm":"RT","displayName":"John E","accountLink":"/user/id/898494298"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"}]}
