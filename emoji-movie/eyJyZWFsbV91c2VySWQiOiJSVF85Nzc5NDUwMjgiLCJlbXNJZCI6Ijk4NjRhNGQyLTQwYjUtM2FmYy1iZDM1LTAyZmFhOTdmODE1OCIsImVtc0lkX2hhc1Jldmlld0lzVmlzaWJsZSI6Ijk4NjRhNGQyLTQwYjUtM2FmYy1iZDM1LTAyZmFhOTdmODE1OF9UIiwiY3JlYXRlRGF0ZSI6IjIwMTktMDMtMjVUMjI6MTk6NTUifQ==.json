Eighty-seven minutes never felt so long.

It is a cinematic masterpiece directed by Tony Leondis, released in 2017. The film itself has overwhelmingly negative reviews, however in this review I pose the argument that it is potentially the best work released in the history of film, and I firmly believe it will make history and be looked back on as a classic. \n\nThe Emoji Movie is an animated film which follows Gene, a young \"meh\" emoji who is struggling with his identity, on his journey to find his true self. On the way, he encounters many charismatic and loveable characters, including Hi-Five, who is voiced by the comedic genius, James Corden. The storyline is not only relatable to young audiences due to it being based entirely on emojis, but it also gives a heartfelt message about friendship and following your heart. \n\nThe soundtrack consists of many touching numbers, including but not limited to: Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go by WHAM!, Feel This Moment by Pitbull, Bubble Butt by Major Lazer, and Watch Me (Whip / Nae-Nae) by Silento. These are only a few of my favourites, but I would strongly encourage anyone to listen to the entirety of the film's soundtrack to fully appreciate the hard work gone into it. Personally, I think that each song is worked quite beautifully into the film - for example, Alex, the owner of Gene's phone, is startled during school to Bubble Butt playing very loudly on his phone without warning. Another memorable feature was Pen Pineapple Apple Pen, which was used when representing YouTube.\n\nPossibly my favourite aspect of this film is the amount of poop jokes included. I have never seen a movie that so relentlessly bombards the viewer with poop joke after poop joke, and I applaud Tony Leondis for his courage in doing so. One of the highlights of this ongoing poop gag is a scene in which the poop emoji and his son come out of the bathroom together chanting \"we are number two\", which is a clever play on words. The poop emoji's son then asks if they should wash their hands, to which the father replies with laughter. I think this scene is very important to the character's backstory, as it shows how poop simply is not hygenic. \n\nOverall, this film is a must-see for people of all ages. It will have you on the edge of your seat with the twists and turns, breath-taking adventures and heart-wrenching decisions. It will have you crying, both from tears of joy and sorrow, as the one question plays on your mind: \"will Gene ever become a true emoji? Or was his effort all in vain?\". I have never seen a film quite like it and I am confident I never will. If someone asked me to rate it out of ten, I would be inclined to give it a 20.","displayName":"Fiona C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-21T12:15:18.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-21T12:15:29.000Z","user":{"userId":"977936139","realm":"RT","displayName":"Fiona C","accountLink":"/user/id/977936139"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","displayName":"alana j","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-21T07:18:20.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-21T07:18:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977935803","realm":"RT","displayName":"alana j","accountLink":"/user/id/977935803"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This is not the worst thing ever, but it is definitely close. The idea is absolutely ridiculous and lazy, and where just getting started. The script is atrocious, the laughs don't land, the characters are bland, and it is littered with an absurd amount of product placement. When its cliches are the least bad things to say about this Sony Animation nightmare, you know you're in trouble. Its just as bad as you'd expect, and I don't suggest wasting time watching it.","displayName":"Tyler S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-18T04:47:44.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-18T04:51:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"977875715","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tyler S","accountLink":"/user/id/977875715"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best movies I ever watched!!!","displayName":"Faris M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-03-16T11:25:48.000Z","updateDate":"2019-03-16T11:26:41.000Z","user":{"userId":"977927200","realm":"RT","displayName":"Faris M","accountLink":"/user/id/977927200"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie is MEANINGLESS.
