A large stepping stone in the animation industry. It's really amazing to see how far Sony has come as an animation company( almost to the quality of Pixar might I add). The animation, don't get me started, it's most realistic characters and setting I've ever seen. The voice acting is top notch. The actors give their best effort. The story is the foundation of a movie itself, the thing that makes or breaks a movie. If you mess up on a story your done for. Fortunately the story is amazing. I mean common emojis that talk, not even Martin Scorsese could think of anything that brilliant. In its core the emoji movie is a deep and dark complex that rattles my mind to this day. Is there a bunch of emojis living in my phone as we speak, damn that's deep. The characters are phenomenal and it's just a great movie. I highly recommend this for anyone above the age of 20.","displayName":"Tbone K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-09-06T13:09:49.837Z","updateDate":"2019-09-06T21:22:36.963Z","user":{"userId":"978244063","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tbone K","accountLink":"/user/id/978244063"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"For a phone movie I would watch Ralph brakes the internet","displayName":"Lillian C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-06T02:53:04.417Z","updateDate":"2019-09-06T02:53:11.324Z","user":{"userId":"978201238","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lillian C","accountLink":"/user/id/978201238"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Lousy movie everything about this movie sucked ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-05T00:36:18.084Z","updateDate":"2019-09-05T00:36:18.084Z","user":{"userId":"260301101","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260301101"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"it was good but not great","displayName":"Daniel B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-04T17:59:52.067Z","updateDate":"2019-09-04T17:59:52.067Z","user":{"userId":"978218060","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel B","accountLink":"/user/id/978218060"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"it was horrible there was almost no smart ideas stupid humor and ruined whatever reputation sony animation studios had","displayName":"patrick b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-03T22:34:55.920Z","updateDate":"2019-09-03T22:34:55.951Z","user":{"userId":"978230526","realm":"RT","displayName":"patrick b","accountLink":"/user/id/978230526"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"It sucks.
