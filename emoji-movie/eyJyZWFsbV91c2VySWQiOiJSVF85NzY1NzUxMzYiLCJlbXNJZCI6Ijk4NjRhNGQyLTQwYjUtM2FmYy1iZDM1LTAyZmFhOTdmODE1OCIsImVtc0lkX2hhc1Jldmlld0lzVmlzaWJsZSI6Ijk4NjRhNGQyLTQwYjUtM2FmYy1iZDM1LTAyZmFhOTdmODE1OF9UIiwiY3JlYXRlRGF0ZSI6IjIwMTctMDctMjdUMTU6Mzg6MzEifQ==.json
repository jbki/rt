There's something justifiable in asking what it would be like if Toys secretly were all alive, because most toys come packaged with character and voice. You pick up a woody doll, and you connect it to all of the characteristics that Tom Hanks had brought to it in Toy Story. If you pick up an emoji pillow, you will never find yourself connecting it to anything other than the face that it's making or the specific thing that it represents.\n\nAnd that doesn't just transfer to the characters shown in the movie, it shows in things like the marketing, the designs, everything. It's like someone was working on Monsters Inc, drew Mike Wazowski, and then said \"Well we're done.\" Just copy and paste that a few times.\n\nYou can make a movie about what it's like to be a dog, because dogs are fun and fun to be around. You can make a movie about what it's like to be in a video game, because those are packed with creativity and ingenuity. You can make a story about Legos because Legos are designed to make stories out of. You can't make a movie about a smiley face. Because it's a god damned smiley face.\n\nThe Emoji Movie is someone trying to write a thousands words on an image that is used as a means to type out fewer words. It is someone attempting to interject specific genders, characteristics, and emotions to symbols meant to be used in any situation happening at any spot on the planet Earth. It's trying to get me invested in the lives of character-less orange spheres that exist to help strangers figure out when I'm being ironic.","displayName":"Quinton H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-27T14:35:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-01-13T20:40:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"910549579","realm":"RT","displayName":"Quinton H","accountLink":"/user/id/910549579"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 27, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"100% The best movie of all time!!

It lacks everything creative and everything that makes a movie successful. The Emoji Movie asks for your money so bad they had to literally do the impossible. New low for the year and possibly for the rest of this decade if there aren't as many cringeworthy movies in the near future. The crew behind this embarrassment that you call a movie will probably regret working on this a few years later when it comes to that time. If you give this movie your money, you should feel ashamed of yourself.","displayName":"EpicLadySponge t","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-27T13:55:15.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-27T17:12:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"971407578","realm":"RT","displayName":"EpicLadySponge t","accountLink":"/user/id/971407578"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 27, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Rubbish!
