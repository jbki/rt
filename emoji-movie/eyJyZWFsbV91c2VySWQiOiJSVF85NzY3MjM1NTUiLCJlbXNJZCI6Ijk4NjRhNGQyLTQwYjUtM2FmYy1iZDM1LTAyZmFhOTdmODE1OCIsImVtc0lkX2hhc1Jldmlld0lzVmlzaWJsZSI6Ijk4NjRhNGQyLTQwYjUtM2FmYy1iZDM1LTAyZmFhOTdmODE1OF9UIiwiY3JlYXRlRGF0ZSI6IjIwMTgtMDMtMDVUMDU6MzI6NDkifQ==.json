I watched it last night, and though many are saying it is VERY similar to 'Wreck it Ralph' which IS true, there are many other movies and even video games that have done the SAME thing whilst being enjoyed and loved by fans.

Unfortunately, the mere premise of a movie based upon Emojis was met with undeserved scorn, mockery, and hatred, as society with its growing cynicism has lost its ability to appreciated fun, good-natured cinema. It must be noted that the Emoji Movie does not shine because of any particularly unique or original themes it presents, but rather in the way that it presents its themes in a manner that is easy for younger audiences to comprehend. In terms of the plot line, many reviewers are quick to label it as \"meh\" or bland, but these beliefs are simply born from preconceived prejudices. In reality, the Emoji Movie has a unique and original plot that is really allowed to excel through the development of fantastic subplots, such as the subplot of Gene's parents. Moreover, these plots are able to do something that most movies, especially animated, fail to do: presented heavy topics with a light and a comedic approach. What many critics fail to understand about this cinematic masterpiece is that the movie is supposed to be FUN. The humor presented throughout the movie is not simply bearable, but rather engaging as long as one allows themselves to view without prejudice and watch the movie for an overall fun time. Overall, the Emoji Movie is what you allow it to be, engage it with an open mind, and enjoy a fun, humorous hour and a half.","displayName":"Daniel O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-03-02T06:36:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-03-02T06:51:21.000Z","user":{"userId":"977143547","realm":"RT","displayName":"Daniel O","accountLink":"/user/id/977143547"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 02, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Didn't see it.
