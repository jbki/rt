Truthfully, I didn't expect to like it, with all of he negative press... But I watched it with my 4 year old, and we were pretty thoroughly entertained... The product placement is a little bit cringe worthy at times, but if you haven't bought the narrative that corporations are the devil, it doesn't have to ruin the movie. Featuring the Twitter Logo bird at the end was semi clever, but also the worst example of product placement for me... Since I feel like Twitter is a communication app, where as other apps featured in the movie were pretty harmless.\n\nThe 3 main characters are interesting and fun, and some of the lessons about being yourself are good.\n\nOverall we thought the movie was a lot of fun!!! I think a lot of the people hating on this movie are the real cliche... The knee jerk desire to virtue signal is more played out than anything in this movie.","displayName":"Chris G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/8703276/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T15:25:50.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-05T15:37:48.000Z","user":{"userId":"808679688","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris G","accountLink":"/user/id/808679688"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"I'll give Sony props for good animation quality and an \"ok\" storyline, but the idea of an emoji society was dumb and the musical score wasn't very good.","displayName":"Thomas F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-05T06:14:42.000Z","updateDate":"2018-08-11T13:06:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"977257605","realm":"RT","displayName":"Thomas F","accountLink":"/user/id/977257605"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 05, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie sucked!! The emoji movie was a plain rip off of Wreak It Ralph, Inside out, and The LEGO Movie. The script and jokes were so lazy. This was the worst movie Iâ€™ve ever seen since batman and Robin.

This is the only movie that has ever made me think, \"I really wish this website had a 7-star option!\" The plot is simple, beautiful, and effective. There is an emoji named Gene who lives in Textopolis, the world inside teenager Alex's phone. He is special because he has multiple emotions and therefore cannot fit in. Eventually, he screws up his face when Alex is texting a girl and it wreaks havoc throughout the smartphone, and he must go on wacky misadventures with his friends Hi-Five and Jailbreak. This plot is elegant on its own, but is complemented by wonderful character development, great animation, and, most notably, outstanding and HILARIOUS jokes, that made me feel like https://bit.ly/2raIDRs. The character Poop, performed by Sir Patrick Stewart, is by far the best character in the film, with his extremely witty jokes that rival (and even surpass) those of the Minions movie. My only complaint about this wonderful experience of a movie is that 1  poop joke every 2 minutes in the first 10 minutes is not nearly enough. For a sequel, I would love it if there were 2 poop jokes a minute throughout the entire film, to further enhance the wonderous comedy.\n\nOverall, I would give the Emoji Movie https://bit.ly/2I5KRLy stars.","displayName":"Human B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-30T15:01:40.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-30T15:14:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"977251330","realm":"RT","displayName":"Human B","accountLink":"/user/id/977251330"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 30, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"it was a great movie. you all hate nice things.","displayName":"hailey c","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-29T19:22:55.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-29T19:23:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"977249699","realm":"RT","displayName":"hailey c","accountLink":"/user/id/977249699"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 29, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"A piece of cinematic gold","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/660292347694423/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-04-28T19:26:18.000Z","updateDate":"2018-04-28T19:26:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"977035697","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977035697"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 28, 2018"}]}
