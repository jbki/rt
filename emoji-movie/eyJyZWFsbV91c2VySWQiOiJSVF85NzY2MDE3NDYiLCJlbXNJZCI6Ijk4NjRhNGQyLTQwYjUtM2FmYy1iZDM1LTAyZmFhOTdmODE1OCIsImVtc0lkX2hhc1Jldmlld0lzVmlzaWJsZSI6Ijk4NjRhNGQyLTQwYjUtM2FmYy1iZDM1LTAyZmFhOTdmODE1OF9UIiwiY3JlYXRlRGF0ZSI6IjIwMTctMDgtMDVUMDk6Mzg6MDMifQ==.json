It has such a unique plot that can appeal to all, a wonderful and diverse set of characters, and the best animation we have seen recent years. I absolutely recommend this film to anyone, because it is truly a masterpiece.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/419089251821812/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-05T08:22:38.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-05T08:30:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"976601573","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976601573"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 05, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Well I knew it was going to be bad and I can now confirm with no real surprise that it is bad.(meh).

The animations were breathtaking and the story line held my attention until the very end and much past that! In fact, I was thinking about the emoji movie at 2 am the next morning.

After seeing the movie four more times, I concluded that the movie was infact the new standard of movies, and that I will never watch another movie because the emoji movie is all I need.","displayName":"Michael H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-05T07:13:56.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-05T07:13:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"976601416","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael H","accountLink":"/user/id/976601416"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 05, 2017"}]}
