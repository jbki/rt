A very interesting yet fun film. To add to the experience you should bring your emoji movie themed fidget spinners and your \"July 28th\" tee-shirts.

I must add that this is a kids movie. Even a kids movie should entertain kids. It is almost impossible to believe that \nit performed worse than expected. The characters are so basic and cliched that a three year old could produce better work. You can anticipate the \"plot twists\" from the very beginning.

It is hard to fine a movie done this well. Even if the viewer does not like emoji type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.","displayName":"Ed A","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/274256769627578/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T11:28:31.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T11:30:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"975317879","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ed A","accountLink":"/user/id/975317879"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I think it is important someone correct the record and respond to any who doubt the work's purpose and effectiveness as a powerful example of art's role in political commentary and cultural criticism.\n\nThe Emoji Movie is frankly Hollywood's first worthy or meaningful critique of Donald Trump's administration.\n\nThe film The Emoji Movie is crafted around a core juxtaposition between communication modes: the president's text-only composition v. the neopictograph emoji, also known as emoticon, also known as smilie, also known as smilie face. \n\nOn the surface this celebration (and, as a work of animation Occidental in origin, necessarily an infantilization) of a simpler and more primitive visual mode of idea conveyance could easily seem an appeal to both tradition and authority. \n\nOne who considers the film within that particular succession of interpretation would surely judge The Emoji Movie politically and culturally conservative. \n\nBut a viewer of The Emoji Movie armed with an understanding of emoji history and evolution's roots in the anti-authoritarian and youth dominated middle-early period of Internet Culture will know the film is actually (though not merely) liberal, and it is radical and revolutionary. \n\nThe Emoji Movie is clearly intended to serve as a proud, clear and defiant blasting bugle of muster sounded in these grim and uncertain hours of the Trumpian dawn. \n\nThis brave and bold film was fashioned in recruitment of a new army, an army of those unafraid to stand resolute, to march forward unceasing, to gather in its advance a greater and greater power, and eventually to stand before the gates of Trump's White House. \n\nThey will rattle the bars and tear at the stones and challenge any within that house come face them on the field. \n\nAnd embroidered bright and high upon their battle standards and banners, a smiling turd.","displayName":"Maxim P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T11:27:25.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T11:30:57.000Z","user":{"userId":"976582538","realm":"RT","displayName":"Maxim P","accountLink":"/user/id/976582538"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I dont get the brutal reviews.
