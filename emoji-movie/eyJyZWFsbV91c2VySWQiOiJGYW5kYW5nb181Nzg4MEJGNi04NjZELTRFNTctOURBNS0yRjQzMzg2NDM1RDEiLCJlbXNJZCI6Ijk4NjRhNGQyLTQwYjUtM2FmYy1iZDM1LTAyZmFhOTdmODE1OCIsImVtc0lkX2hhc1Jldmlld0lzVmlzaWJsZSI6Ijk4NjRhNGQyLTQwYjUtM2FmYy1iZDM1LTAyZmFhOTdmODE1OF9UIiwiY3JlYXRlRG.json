It's like Inside Out, except they're trying to be hip with the new generation. That results in the Emoji Movie. Literally nobody asked a movie about emoji's. The worst part as well is that it's the most basic plot. Nothing new from Hollywood. But people with way more skills can make a basic plot like this more exciting. Even though the movie is terrible, at the least the animation is amazing.
