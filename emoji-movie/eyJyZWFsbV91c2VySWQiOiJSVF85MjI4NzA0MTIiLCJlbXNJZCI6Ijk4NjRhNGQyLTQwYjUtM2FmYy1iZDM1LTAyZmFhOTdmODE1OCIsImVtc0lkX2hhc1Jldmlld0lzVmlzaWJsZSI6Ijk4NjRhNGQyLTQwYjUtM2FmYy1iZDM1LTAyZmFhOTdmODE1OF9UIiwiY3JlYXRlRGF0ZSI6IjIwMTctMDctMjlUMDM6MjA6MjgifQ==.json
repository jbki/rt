Compared to this movie, watching paint dry is the more funnier experience. \nMovies like this one should raise the question if people like Amy Pascal are really up to the task when it comes to movies.

The voice acting wasn't bad, but the story was. It was \n uncreative, and incredibly predictable, in that it was like seeing inside out or wreck it ralph again with different characters. The whole story had already been played out before. \n\nThe movie was chock full of ads, and outdated pop culture references like the Pineapple pen video and Silento's \"watch me\".  Not to mention all of the cringe worthy lines such as \"put some sauce on that dance burrito\" Would not see again.","displayName":"Andrew L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T01:52:09.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T02:01:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"976581145","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew L","accountLink":"/user/id/976581145"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"}]}
