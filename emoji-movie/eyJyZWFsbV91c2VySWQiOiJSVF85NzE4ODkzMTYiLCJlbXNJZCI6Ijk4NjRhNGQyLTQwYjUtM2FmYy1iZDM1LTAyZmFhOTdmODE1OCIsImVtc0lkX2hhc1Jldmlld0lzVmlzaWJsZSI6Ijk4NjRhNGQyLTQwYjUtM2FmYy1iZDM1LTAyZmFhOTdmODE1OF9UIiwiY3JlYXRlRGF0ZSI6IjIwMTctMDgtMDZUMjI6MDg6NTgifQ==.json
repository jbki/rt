You've seen EVERY character trait in this movie before. There's nothing original other than it's a movie about emojis. The jokes are more bland than a chicken without seasoning and the monotone parents totally don't get annoying after 5 minutes. The only good thing I can say is the animation wasn't too bad. Overall a bland, generic movie with no real special qualities.","displayName":"Andrew H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-06T21:10:48.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-06T21:20:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"973441533","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew H","accountLink":"/user/id/973441533"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 06, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is great. I'm watching it with my fianc√© right now at AMC dine in theater. I would absolutely recommend this movie for anyone who wants a private comfortable place to spend some time with his/her significant other or plutonic friend who you want to get to the next level with. This movie is also great for doing cardio; plenty of access to stairs, but you definitely need to see it in theaters. Also this movie has given me time to think about my life, catch up on my emails, and right a concise review of my viewing experience. COME SEE THIS MOVIE IN THEATERS!!!!!","displayName":"Oliver v","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-06T21:05:36.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-06T21:10:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"976606558","realm":"RT","displayName":"Oliver v","accountLink":"/user/id/976606558"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 06, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I think the movie was awesome ??","displayName":"Ashlyn S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-06T21:00:30.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-06T21:01:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"976606552","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ashlyn S","accountLink":"/user/id/976606552"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 06, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Cant wait for this movie to come out on dvd... so i can use it as a frisbee.

This movie is basically the Ghostbusters of the modern era, forget the actual modern day Ghostbusters. I watched this movie expecting it to be terrible, but boy was I wrong. This movie was very funny and witty, and has quite frankly restored my faith in humanity and it's future in movie making. Emojis are fun and hip with kids these days, so it has a very big appeal to it, and Gene is such a relatable character, as kids these days definitely face the struggles of being different in today's society. I would recommend this movie to everyone who feels insecure about there place in society.","displayName":"Andrew B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-06T19:49:16.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-06T20:02:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"976606399","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew B","accountLink":"/user/id/976606399"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 06, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Awful!!

It has great technicality work, but lacks writing, storyboarding, plot, and character development. Also, the characters themselves are bad as well. No one wants to see a movie about emojis, period! Instead of sticking with something original/creative Sony decided to stick with something trendy/modern, but failed embarrassingly. Definitely by far the worst creation made by Sony Animation Pictures. Overall 3/10.","displayName":"Fritz R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-06T19:06:14.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-07T20:06:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"976586204","realm":"RT","displayName":"Fritz R","accountLink":"/user/id/976586204"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 06, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I don't know what's worse, this or that rubbish new Ghostbusters remake.
