Poorly written characters with lazy dialogue and \"jokes\" make up the Emoji Movie where there didn't seem to be a hint of actual creativity.  Just a feature length ad for various apps with old internet references tossed in.  I suppose it wasn't the outright atrocity I was worried it would be but it is also worse than the \"meh\" I was hoping for.  Felt in a constant state of mild irritation but survived without wanting to shut this thing off to protect my sanity so I guess it can't be bottom of the barrel bad right?","displayName":"Jaime  L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-29T18:42:28.000Z","updateDate":"2017-12-29T18:50:23.000Z","user":{"userId":"910760535","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jaime  L","accountLink":"/user/id/910760535"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie ever made, 100 emoji out of 10 as Jack says","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/911963158980798/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-29T12:42:47.000Z","updateDate":"2017-12-29T12:43:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"977012802","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977012802"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Not nearly as bad as people said, can be a fun children's movie.","displayName":"Joel H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-29T09:38:49.000Z","updateDate":"2017-12-29T09:39:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"977012285","realm":"RT","displayName":"Joel H","accountLink":"/user/id/977012285"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"If I could give negative stars, I would ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-29T04:57:21.469Z","updateDate":"2017-12-29T04:58:18.011Z","user":{"userId":"260002267","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260002267"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This cinematic masterpiece, is the most spectacular adaptation of the modern age in film. The character development in this film, is awe-inspiring. The protagonist of this film, Gene, is the most three dimensional character : no, person, that I've been lucky enough to know over the 86 minutes of this film. The other characters of this movie, Hi-5, Jailbreak, Poop, Smiler, and the many other inspirations in this film, have changed my perception of the modern era. All in all, this cinematic masterpiece is a film to be remembered, and passed on throughout the future generations.","displayName":"Abby L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-28T13:53:15.000Z","updateDate":"2017-12-28T14:01:18.000Z","user":{"userId":"977009203","realm":"RT","displayName":"Abby L","accountLink":"/user/id/977009203"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was an amazing movie that was so inspiring and great!!!","displayName":"Mairead E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-28T10:13:22.000Z","updateDate":"2017-12-28T10:15:20.000Z","user":{"userId":"977008485","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mairead E","accountLink":"/user/id/977008485"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"There are movies so bad that you want to shoot it in the face for one of two reasons: 1) they are diseased and must be destroyed lest their infection spreads to unwitting viewers, or 2) they are actual evil and their destruction prevents the world from being a worse place. This is somewhere between those two; one on hand, you have voice actors like James Corden and Maya Rudolph actually *performing* to the best of their ability, making this movie's destruction a mercy killing for them. On the other hand, you have Sir Patrick Stewart willingly playing a shit emoji, meaning he willingly walked into a recording studio and read $h!t emoji lines, cashed a paycheck with the words \"$h!t Emoji\" in the Memo line, and then bought some $h!t with his $h!t emoji cash. It's not quite on the level of buying conflict diamonds, but it sure feels close.","displayName":"Omar L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-27T00:33:02.000Z","updateDate":"2017-12-27T18:00:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"797612627","realm":"RT","displayName":"Omar L","accountLink":"/user/id/797612627"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 27, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Can we please make the the Tomatometer at 0% and the Audience Score at 0% liked it.
