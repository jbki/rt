People have to learn to not judge things based on what they look like, because by then, they would have given up hope on it altogether. They need to appreciate the good aspects of a movie by not what it looks like, but what it contains. The opening was good, the humor was modern and up to today's times, the animation was amazing, especially with the hand, and some sub-plots were resolved, if not all sub-plots. All you see is a cringy movie with shit, crap, and double shit, but you have to look past that and appreciate the aspects. For example: Poop was an ironically classy gentlemen, most of the aspects of modern technology were input(such as internet trolls, viruses, spam, phone apps, people on their phones all the time, emojis, and even the rejected emojis), and we get something spectacular, the romance sub-plot of Gene and Jailbreak, which didn't look like it was resolved, but certain implications say that love is in the air and cupid's arrows have been shot! All in all, I give it the rating it deserves: 5 stars.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2087107938179926/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-07T14:20:56.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-07T14:37:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"976745066","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976745066"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 07, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Amidst some buoyant animation and some inventive flourishes, The Emoji Movie touts a story and style that is all too disconcerting to the future of film in general. Technology is no doubt a prominent force in our modern world almost to a fault. Instead of critiquing our use of phones and apps as our sole interest, The Emoji Movie practically worships the devices, insisting that we are only getting worse so we might as well embrace having our faces plastered to an electronic. There is no celebration of actual one-on-one dialogue (the entire climax revolves around sending a text to a girl), and there is no optimism about kids growing up in a technology driven landscape. It's rather cynical. Throw into that the fact that the film often is diverting, but grates the longer and longer it drags on with over the top vocal work and lowest common denominator jokes and music cues. The world it does present within the phone is colorful and clever enough, but the film never tries and find a way to not celebrate consumerism. It is a dispiriting animated film in almost all aspects. Wait for Pixar's next instead.

This strange abomination of bright colors and Patrick Stewart. \nIt's not a good movie. It's a bland, overdone plot with no creative spin. It's aiming towards no demographic. Too much strange adult humor for kids, too bland for adults, too un-relatable and overdone done for teens. It's so confusing and is honestly such a mess that it's almost worth seeing, just so you can understand what a complete failure this is. The only thing I applaud about it is some of the environments and creative usage of character designs. the animators tried so hard to make this emoji look better then it actually is, and it succeeded. at times, the voice acting can be enthusiastic and does a good job of expressing emotion. Wouldn't suggest this movie if you're looking for something fun to do for an hour and fifteen.","displayName":"Mara H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-06T01:00:46.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-06T01:10:28.000Z","user":{"userId":"976741134","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mara H","accountLink":"/user/id/976741134"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 06, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"It wasn't that bad, it's just the fact that it was about emojis.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/784934525018997/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-05T18:34:33.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-05T18:35:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"976711321","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976711321"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 05, 2017"}]}
