There is no way to describe how funny the subplots are of the meh emojis having feelings but then saying them in the meh tone, about 12 times this happened and I laughed every. Single. Time. There is no way to stop this train with star actors like sir Patrick Stewart as a turd. That is so funny! A man that has been knighted as a talking poop! And he makes sure to tell you that in the 7 lines he has in the movie. The romance is powerful, the scene where they ride the waves of spotify(tm) the romance was amplified by them shoehorning in a message about gender stereotypes and the likes. I urge you to go out and see this generations citizen Kaine today!\n\nWhen do I get my money sony?","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/511909019148648/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-02T12:09:26.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-02T12:19:39.000Z","user":{"userId":"976594179","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976594179"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 02, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The only description for this horrid movie is a parent trying to be \"hip\" and \"with it\" in front of their teenagee only to ruin the \"trends\" they are displaying in the process.
