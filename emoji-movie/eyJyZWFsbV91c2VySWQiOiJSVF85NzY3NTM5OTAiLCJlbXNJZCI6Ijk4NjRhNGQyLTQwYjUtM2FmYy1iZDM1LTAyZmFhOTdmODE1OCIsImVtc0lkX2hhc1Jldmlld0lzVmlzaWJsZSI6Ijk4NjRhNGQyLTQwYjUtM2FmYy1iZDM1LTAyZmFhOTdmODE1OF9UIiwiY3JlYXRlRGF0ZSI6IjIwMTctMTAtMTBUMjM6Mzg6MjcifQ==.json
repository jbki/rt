It could be worse. Oh wait- it can't. As unoriginal as it is, the \"jokes\" were laughably boring. Probably the only positive is the animation, and I'll admit, I kind of liked it. But, don't judge a movie by it's poster (which I do sometimes). The plot was silly, and the voice acting sounded like the cast was bored as heck. For some reason, it kind of looked like a mixmash of emojis, The Lego Movie, Wreck-It-Ralph, and Inside Out smushed together into a cash grab.Please. Don't waste your time.
