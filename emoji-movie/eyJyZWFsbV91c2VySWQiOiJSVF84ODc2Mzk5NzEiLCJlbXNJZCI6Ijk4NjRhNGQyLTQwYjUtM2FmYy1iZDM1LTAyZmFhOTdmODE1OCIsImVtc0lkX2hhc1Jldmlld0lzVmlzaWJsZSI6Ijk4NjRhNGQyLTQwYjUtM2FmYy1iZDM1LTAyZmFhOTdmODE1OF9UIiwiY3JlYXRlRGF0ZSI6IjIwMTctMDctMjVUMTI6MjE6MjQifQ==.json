I cannot believe we finally did it. A movie on emojis. My passion is murdered because of this film. God help me. For those who don't know me, I love animation. I've been influenced by many of the classic movies and TV shows and by Disney. I have made many flip-books back in the day. I also have made movies before and I continued to make movies in high school. I was on board with the animated movies that came out last year....until that faithful day when me and my brother saw this....horrific experience. A movie so ungodly horrendous and mindless that my heart has been crushed. \n\nThere are no words to describe how awful this is and I'm at a loss on what to talk about. Here's one thing I have to distress here: why emojis? Really? Emojis? Is this the big buzz now? If it is, I'm questioning Hollywood. \n\nLong story short, this is a cinematic abortion. Avoid at all costs!","displayName":"Jacob L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-25T10:51:25.000Z","updateDate":"2017-09-01T16:04:14.000Z","user":{"userId":"976152141","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jacob L","accountLink":"/user/id/976152141"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 25, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I don't even have to see this movie to know it's going to be really bad","displayName":"Paris M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-25T03:22:19.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-25T03:22:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"911912605","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paris M","accountLink":"/user/id/911912605"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 25, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Was absolutely awful.
