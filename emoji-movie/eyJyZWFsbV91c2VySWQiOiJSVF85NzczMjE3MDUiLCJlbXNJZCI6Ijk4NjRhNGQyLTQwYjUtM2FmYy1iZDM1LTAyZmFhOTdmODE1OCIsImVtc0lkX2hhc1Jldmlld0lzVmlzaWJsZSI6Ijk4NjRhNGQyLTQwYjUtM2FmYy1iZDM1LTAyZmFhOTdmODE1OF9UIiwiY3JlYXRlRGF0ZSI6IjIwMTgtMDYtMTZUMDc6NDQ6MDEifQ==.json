It's animation looks incredible And surpasses all animated movies made before it. The performance by cast here is great. It's horrible how competitors pay critics to leave bad scores even the movie academy couldn't award Emoji movie just because of other studios. They even went as far as to give it 3 golden raspberries  just because it's good. Overall i think it's a beautiful experience and i would recommend it to all my friends.","displayName":"Matej G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-11T02:41:24.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-11T02:59:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"977314699","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matej G","accountLink":"/user/id/977314699"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 11, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Would you believe that The Emoji Movie was born from the director's love of Toy Story and basing the themes of being yourself and feeling different on his own experiences growing up gay? No? Well that's how this this film came to be. I'm not shitting you, I swear. Given the intense vitriol this film received, I was not expecting much of anything good. I was mostly expecting another shitty comedy to the innumerable other shitty comedies I've watched over the years. Much to my surprise, The Emoji Movie isn't nearly as bad as I was expecting. It's not good, but I didn't think it was bad either. It's just a mediocre film with familiar themes which it doesn't expand upon in any meaningful way. The story follows an emoji named Gene who is a \"meh\" emoji who can display more than just that emotion. This puts him at odds with other emojis and the top emoji, Smiler, seeks to destroy him, Logan's Run-style. So, Gene goes on the run with the Hi-5 emoji to find the hacker who can reprogram him. While on this quest, Gene falls in love, learns to love himself, so on and so forth. The Emoji Movie is lackluster more than anything else, giving into tired themes and product placement (It's not like say, Jurassic World, which slyly threw jabs at product placement). But while many critics hailed this film as a sign of the downfall of civilization, I was just left indifferent to it (Even as someone who refuses to use emojis in texts and largely hates the modern world). I've seen much worse than this, including films that I'm fairly certain gave me brain damage. So, no, The Emoji Movie is not the end of times. It's just thoroughly mediocre.","displayName":"Keenan S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-09T01:34:49.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-09T01:34:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"913037447","realm":"RT","displayName":"Keenan S","accountLink":"/user/id/913037447"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 09, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Historians will view this in the future as part of the beginning of the decline of Western civilisation","displayName":"Sam A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-08T11:57:23.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-08T11:58:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"67922952","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sam A","accountLink":"/user/id/67922952"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 08, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"THIS SHIT AIN'T NOTHING BUT A WASTE OF TIME, NOT RECOMMENDED IT, AND WON'T EVEN RENT IT.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/927999804039200/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-06-07T03:12:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-06-07T03:13:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"977309051","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977309051"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 07, 2018"}]}
