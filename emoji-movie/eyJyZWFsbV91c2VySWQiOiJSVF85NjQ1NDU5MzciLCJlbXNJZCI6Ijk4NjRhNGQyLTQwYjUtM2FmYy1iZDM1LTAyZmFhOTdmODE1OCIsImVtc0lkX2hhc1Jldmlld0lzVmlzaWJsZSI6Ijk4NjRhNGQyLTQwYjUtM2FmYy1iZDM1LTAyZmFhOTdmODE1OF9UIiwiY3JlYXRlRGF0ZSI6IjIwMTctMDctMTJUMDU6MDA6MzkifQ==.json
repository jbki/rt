With Yet another moron Move by Sony. How do I back up on this?  I'll tell you.  This Movie has no Moral Lessons in it.  The Characters are babyish, and  they seem very annoying. Even Looking at this makes it reek of desperation.  Sorry if I have to be this way but there is no way in a Million years I will be dragged into this film.  Sony should of continued to make more CWACOM movies, and improve that, instead of putting out garbage like this. What Ever Happened to Movies like Harriet the Spy  and Good Burger. See those movies had talent and creativity. That is what sells.","displayName":"Benjamin W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-07T18:48:29.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-07T19:00:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"976518960","realm":"RT","displayName":"Benjamin W","accountLink":"/user/id/976518960"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was awesome.
