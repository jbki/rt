Take the hairs off your ass crack, then eat some shit and puke that on your ass hair, that wouldn't even get close to how bad this movie is.  Horrible boring characters, garbage story, villain is shit, garbage message (why feminism), and dear god, it's nothing but a cringe fest.  Why we didn't get a popeye movie over this garbage, i would never know.  Fuck this piece of ass, if you coat this shit in muddy dirty wet fart juice, you wouldn't get close to smelling the failure this shit put out.

The God fater of animaterd movies. Absolute art. IU love TJ muller he makes me moan. Buyt the absolute highlight of the movie has got to be Sir Patrick Stewars as hthe Poop. That was the hottest miveu moment of a;ll time.\n\nTo be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand The Emoji Movie. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Gene's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Shakespearen literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Emoji Movie truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Poop's existential catchphrase \"Haha! We are number two!\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Tony Leondis' genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have an Emoji Movie tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
