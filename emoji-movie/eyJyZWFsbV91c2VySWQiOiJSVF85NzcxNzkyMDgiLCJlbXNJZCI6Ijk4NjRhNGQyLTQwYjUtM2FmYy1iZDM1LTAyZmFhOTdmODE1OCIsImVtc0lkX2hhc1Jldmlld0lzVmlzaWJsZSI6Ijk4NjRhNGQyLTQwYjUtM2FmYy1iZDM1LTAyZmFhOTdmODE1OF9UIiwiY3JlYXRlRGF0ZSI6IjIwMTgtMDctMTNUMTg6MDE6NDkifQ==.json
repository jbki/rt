It's no Pixar, Disney, or DreamWorks animation box office smash but this movie isn't that bad. And if you're not big into using Emoji's on your phone then yes you will not enjoy this movie compared to someone who does. There's more teenage/adult humor in this that's actually funny. Again it's a movie about Emoji's go in with an open mind and stop expecting it to be in the same level as Frozen or some other Disney movie.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-13T16:56:35.064Z","updateDate":"2018-07-13T16:56:40.955Z","user":{"userId":"947850685","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/947850685"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The Emoji Movie is entertaining enough to watch in the theaters, though the only thing that stands out about it is the animation.","displayName":"Dylan G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-13T15:06:05.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-13T15:11:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"977298930","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dylan G","accountLink":"/user/id/977298930"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 13, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Look, I'm not saying the movie was bad because it's a movie based around Emojis, that's one of it's major problems, but at the same time one of the least you should be worrying about. Yeah, it'll make sense.\n\nI can give movies with unusual ideas a go, and that's if I'm even interested in watching it. If they could manage to turn something as plotless as Legos into one of the best animated films of its year, as well as whole, then, hey, why not give it a go with other products that have no real story behind them?\n\nWell, it seems that they attempted that with The Emoji movie and Patrick Stewart-ed all over it. First and foremost is the entire idea of it trying to appear hip, trendy, and every typical crap you'd expect a movie desperate to appeal to smart phone users.\n\nNow we move onto story and plot...yeah, I can't keep a straight face with that one. THIS is the movie's BIGGEST problem. The story and plot behind this are cringe and painfully unoriginal. The movie doesn't even try to use its \"be who you truly are\" narrative and try something more...fresh with it. Hell even garbage like Cars managed to try something \"fresh\" with it's fish out of water and Doc Hollywood rip off storyline (and I'm only saying Cars is better than the Emoji movie when compared, because a good movie it's not anyway). No, you get exactly what you'd expect with a movie using that storyline. The lead character is different, causing it to backfire, they are trying to force him to be like everyone else (eg. a \"normal\", one-reaction type of Emoji), and results in the corporation trying to annihilate him. That's as easy as I can make it for you, and you can pretty much guess how it goes from there. The different guy meets another person who's also unusually different, they try to fix his problem, and it turns out at the end he really shouldn't have to conform to what society thinks. Why be the same schtick when you can stand out?\n\nThere was so much potential for this movie to also explore commentary on social media and the users, but they drop it immediately because the movie would rather focus on product placement than anything else (yeah, trust me when I say they literally make a huge emphasis on selling Candy Crush, Facebook, and Youtube Cat videos than selling a good story). One conversation is how the phone user has so many friends and why he's so popular, and the High-Five emoji states how they're not real friends, but people who just like him. We don't get past that, because they'd rather go on to yap about Spotify and other unoriginal crap. The people behind this couldn't even be bothered to take advantage of the social media apps to explore the kid and give us some more depth into him.\n\nThen, we have my PERSONAL favorite complaint, and it's the lack of LOGIC behind it. I don't care that the emojis live in a world of their own, that they communicate, etc. To Hell with that. What bothers me is how it doesn't even seem to realize how absurd its setup of the Emoji world is. Apparently, Textopolis isn't a city that every phone out there is universally connected to. No, EACH PHONE has their own Textopolis. This brings up many questions and concerns.\n\nThe Emojis don't want to be deleted because of the mayhem Gene's stupidity has caused on the phone (another point I'll bring up momentarily), but yet if thought about logically, what happens when people upgrade to new phones? People get new phones every year and data is lost, therefore the entire idea of an individual, conscious Textopolis in every phone makes no sense, because the horrifying fact is that those emojis are going to be wiped out once people get a new phones. It would just have been a REALISTIC approach if Textopolis had been a world of its own within a branch of the Internet, not just one different city in each phone.\n\nThe other logical fault to this is how only the \"main\" human seems to be suffering from phone troubles thanks to Gene. You can't expect me or anyone else to believe that this hasn't happened before in SEVERAL OTHER phones. Which actually leads me to the kid's phone glitching. Why does the phone and the apps start acting up, get played, and activate when the Emojis travel to and mess around in them? I'm positive the kid's phone (I keep calling him kid because I didn't even bother remembering his name, since the humans only exist just to exist) should not be the only one glitching, making sounds, playing music randomly, and games opening up because I'm positive every other phone has had Emojis traveling around and using apps.\n\nFinally, why does Textopolis have an entire company dedicated to where Emojis go to get used? This alone makes no sense whatsoever. Opening up text apps and emoji text boards in your phone happens in mere seconds, and somehow they can predict when people are about to open up their messages and the Emoji characters (the most popular ones used) literally line up in chambers to be selected. What happens when none of the emojis people want are in Most Popular? Do they haul ass to find the Dragon Emoji since it's not in the lineup? Do they teleport the Salsa Dancer or Pregnant woman Emoji when they can somehow predict the users are going to pick those? None of this makes logical sense. It would make more sense sense if, like a State Farm worker, the emojis just vanish for a second or so (all of the emojis; a new one at a time for turns, since evidently Textopolis can't have such a small amount of Emojis with only one of each, and a handful of different skin colors), and then reappear back on spot once it went through.\n\nThe characters in the movie are also not original, so I won't even bother. Another fine example of what NOT to do in a movie is making dry, boring jokes. The movie tries to throw you clever jokes or even forced ones, and none are funny. The CLOSEST this movie got to getting a giggle out of me was when Smiler (Maya Rudolph) comes into the office, and tells another Emoji \"I am so ANGRY right now, ahehehe,\" all while holding onto her gigantic, toothy smile. She was technically my \"favorite\" character, because I tend to love bright, cheerful, somewhat diabolical, and extra smiley characters, but she still didn't manage to win me over. Her attitude in the movie essentially ruined any chances of my adding her as a real favorite.\n\nHowever, I will defend it in one way: it is NOT worse than Food Fight. No sir. In Emoji's defense, and take into mind that the following is just \"for what's worth\", it's actually beautifully animated and has a \"better\" story (whereas Food Fight couldn't even be bothered to find out what its own plot really is).\n\nI'l stop there because there's just too much to complain about.\n\nBut on a final note, that's not how wiping your phone's data completely works either.","displayName":"George R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-12T01:10:39.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-12T01:28:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"908929634","realm":"RT","displayName":"George R","accountLink":"/user/id/908929634"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 12, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Look, I'm not saying the movie was bad because it's a movie based around Emojis, that's one of it's major problems, but at the same time one of the least you should be worrying about.

My only complaint is that I wish there was more Just Dance, preferably with the Disney edition. Seeing the smile on Smiler brought me warmth and happiness.
