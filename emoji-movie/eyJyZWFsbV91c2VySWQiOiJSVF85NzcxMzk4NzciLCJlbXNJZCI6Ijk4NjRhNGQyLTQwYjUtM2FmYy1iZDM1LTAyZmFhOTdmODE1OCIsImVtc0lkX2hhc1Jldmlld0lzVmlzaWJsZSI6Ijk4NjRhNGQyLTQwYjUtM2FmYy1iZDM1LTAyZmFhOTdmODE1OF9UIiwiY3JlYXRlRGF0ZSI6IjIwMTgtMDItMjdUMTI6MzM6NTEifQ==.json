Stay away from this!  It eats your time and money, and that is about the best thing about it!\nAll I can say is I have kids, so I HAD to go to this.  My expectations were very, VERY low, and it was still painful to sit though.  I know you are supposed to suspend disbelief, but it is like the movie makers are CHALLENGING you to stretch your credibility as much as you can.  Geez  - they are making movies about glorified LETTERS.  Oh man.\nOn the up side, my kids seemed to enjoy it somewhat.  But even they watched it once, and haven't asked to see it again (usually they want to watch a movie over and over for whatever reason)","displayName":"cork b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-02-27T08:01:45.000Z","updateDate":"2018-02-27T09:06:12.000Z","user":{"userId":"977138468","realm":"RT","displayName":"cork b","accountLink":"/user/id/977138468"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"this shit was lit nigga rating 10/10","displayName":"Furfag M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-02-27T07:59:35.000Z","updateDate":"2018-02-27T08:00:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"977139556","realm":"RT","displayName":"Furfag M","accountLink":"/user/id/977139556"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 27, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is the greatest movie in existence.
