It was actually good in my opinion. I expected the movie to be the worst movie ever, but  I was wrong. There were a few scenes that did make me cringe, and at some points the film tried a little too hard to be funny and \"fit in with the kids,\" but other than that, the movie was bearable to watch. It wasn't awful and wasn't great. It was just ok.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1888650721457492/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-09T12:34:33.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-09T12:41:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"976612291","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976612291"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 09, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I started the film and about half way through, was trying to figure out if the ads had finished yet.

It had 100% up to date memes and trends. All the apps' screen times were all evenly placed and none had too much time over the other, and wasn't the stereotypical image of social medias like everyone thinks they are. The plot was really original and was executed very nicely.
