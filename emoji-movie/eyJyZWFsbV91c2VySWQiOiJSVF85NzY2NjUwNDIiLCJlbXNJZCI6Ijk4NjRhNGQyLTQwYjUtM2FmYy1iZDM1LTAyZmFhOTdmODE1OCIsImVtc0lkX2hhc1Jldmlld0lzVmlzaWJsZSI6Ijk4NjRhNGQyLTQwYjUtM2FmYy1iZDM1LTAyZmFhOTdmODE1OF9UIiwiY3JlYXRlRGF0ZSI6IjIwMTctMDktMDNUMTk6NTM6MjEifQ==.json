As there were no available seats, I decided that instead, we would watch this for the memes. Maybe a \"so-bad-it's-good\" movie, I had hoped. I was horribly, horribly mistaken. Bathroom humor, horrible premise AND execution, little to no actual character. Seeing this movie sent chills up and down my spine, for I could not fathom that people came up with, invested in, and released such a complete and utter embarrassment to mankind as a whole. This is not what cinema was meant to become. We were forced to leave the viewing within the first fifteen minutes, as it was so cringe-worthy and all-round horrid. Busy frames, bad humor, bad movie. No age group would genuinely enjoy this movie, give for infants that don't understand it and like to watch bright colors and pop songs. The eight year olds who might like the idea of emojis, and a movie around it, would be too old to laugh at the bathroom humor, and too young to understand the adult humor. WHO IS YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE? YOU'VE MADE THE WORST MOVIE TO EVER BE RELEASED. WHY DID YOU INVEST IN THIS? WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?","displayName":"peter p","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-09-03T19:14:43.000Z","updateDate":"2017-09-03T19:25:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"976664965","realm":"RT","displayName":"peter p","accountLink":"/user/id/976664965"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 03, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I found this pretty good\n\nWait.

Beautiful animation has been combined with glorious storytelling, not to mention likable and relatable characters. Adults can relate to Gene's societal struggle of needing to live up to a stereotype, while children laugh at the hilarity of characters like Hi-5 and, of course, the poop emoji, played by James Corden and Sir Patrick Stewart, respectively. While I adored James Corden's character, I personally believe that an even greater actor would be the one and only Nick Crompton. Detailed subplots only added to our enjoyment of this movie, which we had the pleasure of seeing on its release date of July 28, 2017. The short lived romance between Gene and Jailbreak rivals the greatest romance stories of all time for its beauty and grace. I truly believe that this will kickstart the wonderful TJ Miller's career and turn him into a worldwide phenomenon. I feel blessed knowing that I have been able to see this film before it sweeps the Oscars and easily gets recognized as the greatest movie of all time. I feel terribly sorry for my brethren who were unable to see this movie on July 28 due to the country they live in. All there really is left to say is that I adore this movie.","displayName":"Shrek S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-09-03T16:33:58.000Z","updateDate":"2017-09-03T17:26:17.000Z","user":{"userId":"976664568","realm":"RT","displayName":"Shrek S","accountLink":"/user/id/976664568"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 03, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie sucks.
