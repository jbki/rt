It, like it's opening lines, is wondrous, mysterious, and magical, presenting thought provoking themes of what it means to truly \"express\" ones self. The movie unfolds into three unique, and detailed story lines, focusing on both the emojis who inhabit the well thought out \"textopolis\" and that of Alex and the parallels of his high school love story. Gene, the main character is well written and complex, a multilayered character who's presence among the other flat emojis is a statement on the Emoji Movies complexity in a world of boring, statementless films. His relationship with High Five, while brief and having been built over the course of a single day, presents its own themes on what friendship really is and can mean in a time where popularity often overrules true relationships. Even Jailbreak, what could have been a typical rouge girl, takes on new dimensions as her social justice esque commentary makes the movie a statement on gender structure in society as well. A key example of this social commentary is presented when Jailbreak uses her princess abilities to in fact save the day, just as gene used his malfunction to save the phone, which shows a young generation that being themselves can be the best thing, an idea no movie has dared even suggest. This idea is found in Gene's parents story line when Mel's own malfunction fixes the..malfunction... in his failing marriage. Even Alex learns that by expressing himself could earn the affection of Addie, of whom his love was so intense that she was his password despite never once having an actual conversation, the true foundation of all healthy relationships. Many have claimed that the film shares suspicious similarities with Wreck it Ralph and the LEGO Movie, which may arguably attempt to explore similar themes and ideas, but these topics are only briefly touched upon in the previously mentioned movies, The Emoji Movie traveled to new extremes, taking the stereotypical characters and recrafting them in a way modern cinema could only dream of seeing again. The romantic subplot between Jailbreak and Gene takes romance to a new level, which Shakespeare could have only ever imagined writing. The scene in which they travel through Spotify, a tear was brought to my eye, as it was in the moment that their eyes met I knew I had witnessed true romance. The movie itself was grand beyond all belief, and as the movie has taught the world, words can only express so much, so I will end my simply review of this immaculate work of art with the most basic of expressions \"??\"","displayName":"Beth J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-02-17T19:41:26.000Z","updateDate":"2018-02-17T19:41:46.000Z","user":{"userId":"977120243","realm":"RT","displayName":"Beth J","accountLink":"/user/id/977120243"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 17, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Kids like it.
