Then the critics starting trashing it so 2nd I had to go because pretentious movie people are the worst and I usually disagree. So I went to an 11:20am showing and thought I'd be alone, then like 20 families showed up. \n\nIt was a kid's movie about a smiley face with an identity crisis, a villain who was not that scary, and a love interest with a mysterious background that ends up being fine. I'm not sure how you can in one sentence say that Sausage Party \"would mix some interesting social critique into its animated entertainment \" a movie about a stupid hot dog trying to get into a bun, and a lady's hygiene product filled with fruit punch, give me a break, and get off your high horse, then turn around and say Emoji Movie was a typical identity crisis kid's movie, and nothing more. \"Ad placement\" was just talking about apps on a phone, did you really want them to do the stupid movie trope creating fake apps? It's not garbage, but it's not great, it's 3 stars and maybe 30-25% not <10%.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10101046643909312/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-02T10:47:58.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-02T11:03:27.000Z","user":{"userId":"976594029","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976594029"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 02, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The Emoji Movie was a great film. the jokes were funny. The voice acting was perfect. But, most importantly, the story was great. It wasn't like any other movie. i have a few complaints, though. Gene and Jailbreak didn't kiss. I know it isn't a big deal for most people, but for me it was. I would've given this a 5-star rating.\n\nWorst part: When the high-five emoji ran in front of Gene and Jailbreak whilst the romantic music was playing. it almost ruined the whole film\n\nBest part: When Gene and Jailbreak were dancing together in the Just Dance app. It made me dab.\n\nI give this movie a 4.5 out of 5.","displayName":"josh%20 b","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-02T10:16:02.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-02T10:32:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"976593959","realm":"RT","displayName":"josh%20 b","accountLink":"/user/id/976593959"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 02, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.

Rather than creating new memorable characters in interesting locations, the creators of this film reuse character tropes of recent animated films (Inside Out, Wreck in Ralph, Lego Movie) while using environments solely based off of mindless apps and product placements like Just Dance, Instagram and Spotify.
