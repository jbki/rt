This movie was garbage. First let's get the \"good\" things (if you can call them that) out of the way. First of all, the animation was solid, I've seen better, but still pretty good. Some of the jokes/references weren't exactly \"funny\", they were more, \"that makes me giggle a little\" or \"oh, I get that.\" Now, the rest of the movie... Well, let's just say you've seen this story a BILLION TIMES (ok maybe not that much but, you get my point). It to the stereotype of (the world inside your \"blank\"), Ripping off many movies in the process. These movies including, Wreck It Ralph, Inside out, the Lego Movie(and I guess toy story in a way). It takes a typical story and changes literally nothing about it. Unlike other movies where it takes that same concept and turns it into something new. For example, people said that Wreck It Ralph was toy story with video games, which really it was, but it had a completely original and different story. Same goes for inside out, and The Lego Movie. This just plain out ripped off Wreck It Ralph. For example, I'll show you how the two stories are similar. The story goes that the main character is supposed to act one way or another, but wants to be different (Ralph/Gene), Along the way the main character gets some help from a wacky Always happy average joe (felix/High-Five) and a female character who develops a more than average relationship with the main character (Vanellope/Jailbreak) and in the end they find out they need to be themselves. SEE HOW SIMILAR THAT IS!!!!?? To sum it up, don't watch this. go watch something else like cars 3 or basically anything that isn't this.","displayName":"Mat S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-19T13:31:22.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-19T14:08:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"976634241","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mat S","accountLink":"/user/id/976634241"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 19, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Very funny movie, my family and I enjoyed it!","displayName":"KM O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-19T10:54:09.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-19T10:54:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"904320642","realm":"RT","displayName":"KM O","accountLink":"/user/id/904320642"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 19, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"BEST MOVIE EVER.
