My question is what is the POINT IN THE MOVIE? I feel that the emoji movie is a  whole movie about ads  because they put ALL apps in that movie like twitter, Instagram, youtube, and even dropbox. The worst thing about the apps is that 95% of the apps aren't used. Worst Movie ever don't waste your time watching it.","displayName":"Brandon R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-12-16T15:28:37.000Z","updateDate":"2018-12-16T15:28:40.000Z","user":{"userId":"977664557","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brandon R","accountLink":"/user/id/977664557"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 16, 2018"}]}
