Knowing its RT rating I went with great reluctance and found myself laughing out loud--repeatedly! I probably enoyed it more than the 9-year-old who wanted to see it so badly.  I would call it 'Inside Out' meets 'Wreck It Ralph.' It may not be super original, but the main female character struggles against her assigned role, frienship triumphs over popularity & nothing in this movie made me want to spend 20 minutes hanging out at the concession stand (which couldn't be said for last 2 versions of King Kong.)","displayName":"LaDawn E","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-09-19T20:04:03.000Z","updateDate":"2017-09-19T20:10:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"953593560","realm":"RT","displayName":"LaDawn E","accountLink":"/user/id/953593560"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 19, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"2/10 on the Emoji Movie. Filled with horrible emoji puns, terrible plot, and it's like Sony ran out of ideas, and doesn't know how phones really work. Poop puns, Hand puns, Dance puns, app puns, emoji puns, you name it. And I can not stand Smiler's voice, ugh. Electricdragon505 was right, PhantomStrider was right, Watchmojo was right, movie critics were right, this movie is one of the worst movie I have ever seen. 2nd to worst to be exact.
