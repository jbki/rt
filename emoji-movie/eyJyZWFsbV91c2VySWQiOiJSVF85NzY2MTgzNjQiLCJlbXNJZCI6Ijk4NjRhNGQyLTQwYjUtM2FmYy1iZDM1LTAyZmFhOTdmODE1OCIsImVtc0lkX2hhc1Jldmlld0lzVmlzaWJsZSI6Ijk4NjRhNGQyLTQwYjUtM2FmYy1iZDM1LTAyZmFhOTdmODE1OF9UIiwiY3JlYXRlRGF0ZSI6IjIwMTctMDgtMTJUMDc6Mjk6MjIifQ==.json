We tried to talk him out of it, but gosh darn it he was going to be very disappointed if we didn't.  So off we went.  And maybe it was our lowered expectations, but surprisingly we all liked the movie.  Yes, it was a bit of a knock off of Wreck-It Ralph, but the basic themes of friendship and finding of self worth were very appealing to our young family.  The dialogue was fairly pat and generally down to young kids' level, but our boys enjoyed the simple approach the film took to its characters and messaging.  I personally was a bit like \"really?\" at the blatant product placement about drop box security, although the Spotify thing didn't bother me so much.  And more importantly the kids didn't care.  They walked out with smiling faces, and so did we.  :-)   So to all you bad reviewers out there: \n¯\\_(?)_/¯","displayName":"Jonathan S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-11T20:41:17.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-11T20:57:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"976617498","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonathan S","accountLink":"/user/id/976617498"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 11, 2017"}]}
