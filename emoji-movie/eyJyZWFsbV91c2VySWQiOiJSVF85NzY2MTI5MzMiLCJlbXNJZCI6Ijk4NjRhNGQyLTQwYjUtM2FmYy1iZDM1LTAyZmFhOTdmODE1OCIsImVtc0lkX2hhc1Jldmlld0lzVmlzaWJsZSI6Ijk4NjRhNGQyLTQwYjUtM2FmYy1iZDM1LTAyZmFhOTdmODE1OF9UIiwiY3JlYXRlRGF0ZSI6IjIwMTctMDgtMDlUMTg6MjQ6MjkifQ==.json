It's a bad film. It's inside out + wreck it ralph but shitty. Watch something else instead, if you give them money they will think making movies with little effort like this is ok.  Adults should still be able to be entertained by films for kids but when the animation sucks, the plot sucks, the characters suck, the setting sucks what can you do? I liked inside out and wreck it ralph but not this,.\n\nThis is one you should skip, although if you liked the minions you very well may enjoy this film. That's the audience for this film.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1903253436664648/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-09T18:00:19.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-09T18:17:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"976612887","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976612887"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 09, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"10/10, would watch again","displayName":"joey t","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-09T17:10:18.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-09T17:13:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"976612797","realm":"RT","displayName":"joey t","accountLink":"/user/id/976612797"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 09, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good movie however not enough yellow.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/493201044358977/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-09T15:46:27.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-09T15:47:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"976612649","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976612649"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 09, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"whole movie is a collection of advertisements and an abomination i'm actually suprised how low the film industry can go","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2010616292501272/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-09T14:30:07.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-09T14:32:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"976612511","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976612511"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 09, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"i love this movie so under rated","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1915468865383274/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-09T14:14:47.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-09T14:15:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"976612486","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976612486"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 09, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Surprisingly decent to me.
