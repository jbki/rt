I'm not old enough to have seen classics like The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey, or Citizen Kane come out, but I had the privilege of watching The Emoji Movie opening night in theaters.\nI had been planning to see it for months, buying all the merchandise I could get my hands on and counting down towards it glorious release date, July 28, which I now consider my birthday (it's the day I finally woke up and saw the light).\nI actually saw it July 27th, the day before; my wife took the kids to see Dunkirk, but while they can have fun watching big explosions and airplane flights, I'll be stimulating my intellect with a truly mesmerizing and enhancing experience. \nThis is one of my favorite films of all time. Scratch that, it is my favorite film of all time. No point in holding back. I see that not all my fellow colleagues agree with me, and that's fine; it took people a while to see the brilliance of 2001: A Space Odyssey, too. I pray to Gene every night. I love him. \nAmen.","displayName":"Nick C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-28T16:38:31.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-28T16:44:05.000Z","user":{"userId":"976292698","realm":"RT","displayName":"Nick C","accountLink":"/user/id/976292698"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Surprise surprise, it sucks.

Miller and his ensemble has created here marks the beginning of a new era in motion picture history. The impressionistic cinematography, elaborate character development and the consistent visual language is nothing less than astonishing.\nA jaw dropping marvel of modern cinema, that will surely go down the history books alongside Citizen Kane, Casablanca and The Shawshank Redemption.","displayName":"Asger B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-27T09:42:10.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-27T09:56:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"976650143","realm":"RT","displayName":"Asger B","accountLink":"/user/id/976650143"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 27, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie... oh god... the only reason I'm giving it 5 stars is because I feel like it, and I can only do this ironically.
