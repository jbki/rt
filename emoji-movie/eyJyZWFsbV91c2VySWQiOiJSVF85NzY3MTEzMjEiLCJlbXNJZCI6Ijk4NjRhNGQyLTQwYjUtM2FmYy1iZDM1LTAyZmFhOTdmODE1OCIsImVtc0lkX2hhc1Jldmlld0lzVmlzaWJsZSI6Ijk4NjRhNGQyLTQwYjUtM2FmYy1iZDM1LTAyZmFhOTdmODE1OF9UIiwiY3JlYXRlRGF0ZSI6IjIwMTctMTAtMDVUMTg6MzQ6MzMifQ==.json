The humor isn't funny, the characters are annoying, the story is predictable, and and the concept (aside form imitating superior animated features) makes little sense. The final straw? Being little more than a cynical and glorified product that panders to modern subculture.","displayName":"Logan M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-04T19:14:45.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-04T19:21:08.000Z","user":{"userId":"970115043","realm":"RT","displayName":"Logan M","accountLink":"/user/id/970115043"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 04, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best animations ever created, extremely hilarious, full of excitement, emotions and puns and truly adventurous.

Tragic humor, incomprehensible message and idiotic dialogue.
