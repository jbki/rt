The plot is predictable in nature, and there is little development of characters, so little to the point I cannot remember the majority of the character's names after watching the movie because all of them lacked any rememberable uniqueness. The Emoji Movie appears more of a last ditch attempt for out-of-touch movie producers at Sony to connect with younger audiences.","displayName":"Wesley T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T09:35:17.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T09:41:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"976585835","realm":"RT","displayName":"Wesley T","accountLink":"/user/id/976585835"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"When I first heard this movie was being made, I was expecting intense erotic scenes of sexual nature between the titular character and his love interest. The trailers clearly showed a great amount of sexual tension between the two leads (the two being James Corden and Patrick Stewart). The thought of these two having sexual intercourse sent me into a euphoric trance. However, when I finally watched the movie, I was unfortunately blue-balled by the fact that there was no such sexual scene between the character of Hi-Five and Poop. This movie could have the greatest sex drama since the erotic cult classic Harry Hill's Sausage Time Live in Leeds. But instead, I got an emotional masterpiece and a pair of blistering blue-balls dangling beneath the seat. What an experience.","displayName":"Jack S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-30T09:33:32.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-30T09:40:43.000Z","user":{"userId":"976585816","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jack S","accountLink":"/user/id/976585816"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was a masterpiece. Comedic timing was incredible and the jokes were simply impeccable. The plot was also beautiful, and could easily be followed. Acting was incredible as well, and really helped you immerse yourself in the story.
