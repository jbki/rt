It is an amazing story about gene, an emoji who doesn't fit in, but then he meets jaibreak, someone else who feels outcast. Now I'm not gonna spoil the whole movie, but at one point they go into the Just Dance app, which I thought lasted for the perfect amount of time and had some of the best jokes. One complaint I have is that in the first 10 minutes of the movie there were 5 poop jokes. I feel like they should have made more. 7 would have been a better number. Overall I rate this movie a ??/10 and ??????????","displayName":"John C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T14:32:33.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T14:36:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"976578935","realm":"RT","displayName":"John C","accountLink":"/user/id/976578935"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is a cinematic masterpiece me me big boy","displayName":"July t","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T14:31:40.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T14:34:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"976578901","realm":"RT","displayName":"July t","accountLink":"/user/id/976578901"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This is the best movie to ever hit theaters.

Just wow. In 20 years time we will look back on this masterpiece and remember it as the highlight of 2017; heck, the 21st century. The plot was gripping, and by the end the tears of both sadness and joy had managed to stick popcorn to my face. At another point I needed the toilet and so decided to wait for a boring part to go. It did not come so therefore I did the only other option and wet myself. One part surprised me so much that my coca-cola I accidentally sent flying, wetting both myself and nearby viewers. I have already booked 2 tickets for tommorow, one in 2D so that I can reapprieciate the masterpiece, and another in 3D so that I can submerge myself in it. I cannot even describe to you the feeling I experienced when I was told this wasn't a new Disney movie, as no other company could make such incredible stuff. The cast line up is fantastic, marketing was funny and loaded with jokes!! Fun for the whole family, or for other lonely men in their 60s with nothing better to do. 100 Patrick Stuart poop emojis / 10. Would recommend.","displayName":"Benidict C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T14:28:46.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T14:37:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"976578908","realm":"RT","displayName":"Benidict C","accountLink":"/user/id/976578908"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The trailers look cringey. The writer tryed so hard to be hip and flopped. And what im hearing from previwers is that the jokes are stale and try too hard. Wouldnt recomend to my worst enemy its so bad.

From the trailers, Tony Leondis' animated comedy film looks like if Inside Out and Wreck-It-Ralph had a baby. The overall story is very cliché and when you go to see this movie and you think something is going to happen, it's most likely going to happen. I did not plan on seeing this film because of a stupid cliché story and it's a film about EMOJIS! This movie most likely hurt Sony's reputation, but they have Spider-Man: Homecoming.
