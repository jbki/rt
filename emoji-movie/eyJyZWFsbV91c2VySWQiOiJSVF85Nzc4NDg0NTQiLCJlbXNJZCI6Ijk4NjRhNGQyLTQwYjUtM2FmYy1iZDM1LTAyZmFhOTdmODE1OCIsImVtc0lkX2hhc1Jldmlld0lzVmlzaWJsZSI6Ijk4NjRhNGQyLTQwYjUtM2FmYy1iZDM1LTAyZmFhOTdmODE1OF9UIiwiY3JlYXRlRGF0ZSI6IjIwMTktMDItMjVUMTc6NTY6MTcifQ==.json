Anyone who finds that moment plausible is tuned to the same wavelength as Green Book, a well-meaning but glib and shallow ode to interracial healing.\n\nThe movie announces itself as \"inspired\" by the real-life relationship of classics-rooted jazz musician Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and smalltime nightclub bruiser Tony \"Lip\" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen). Tony becomes Don's designated guide â\" and the audience's, too.\n\nThat's not just because Tony's son, Nick Vallelonga, co-wrote the script with Brian Hayes Currie and director Peter Farrelly. (Yes, half of the Dumb and Dumber team.) Don is depicted as admirable but exotic, and the filmmakers clearly expect viewers to be more comfortable with Tony. He's rough-edged, loudmouthed, and openly racist â\" but, ya know, a regular guy.Mortensen, seldom seen in comic roles, romps through this one, making Tony far more engaging than the scenario alone can explain. Ali is impressively controlled as Don, who's intent on maintaining his dignity in a world designed to strip him of it. The musician has groomed himself into the antithesis of white-supremacist notions of what a black man is, but that process is in the past. It's Tony who's about to get an education, which is the reason â\" well, one of the reasons â\" the movie focuses on him.\n\nWith the Copacabana closed for renovations, Tony needs a job to support his wife, Dolores (a charming Linda Cardellini), and their kids. When he accepts an offer to drive Don on a concert tour, he's handed a copy of the Green Book, the guide to places African-Americans can safely eat and sleep south of the Mason-Dixon Line.\n\nMuch of what follows is fictionalized, but the Green Book was real. Don actually did have to bunk in blacks-only motels and rooming houses, while his driver and two white accompanists usually slept elsewhere. Lavatories and dining rooms were off limits to Don, even in venues where he performed.","displayName":"Gavin B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-02-15T10:53:07.000Z","updateDate":"2019-02-15T10:53:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"977796774","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gavin B","accountLink":"/user/id/977796774"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Feb 15, 2019"}]}
