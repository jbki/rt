At some point during the film I contemplated throwing my small popcorn at the screen and then slashing it with a plastic knife from the movie theatre cafe as I was so utterly pissed off of the horrific garbage that is The Emoji Movie. I would have rather spent an hour and a half having someone's diarrhea being slowly ladled into my ear then watch this movie again. The United States government should get rid of the Guantanamo Bay prison and various forms of torture and instead use The Emoji Movie as the sole method of interrogation for high-security prisoners as it is so vile and painful to watch. Do not waste your money on this terrible movie.","displayName":"rachel g","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-16T19:37:52.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-17T06:54:49.000Z","user":{"userId":"976628497","realm":"RT","displayName":"rachel g","accountLink":"/user/id/976628497"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 16, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"1960 : we will have flying cars in the future \n2017 : the emoji movie","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1604408806299761/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-16T19:11:18.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-16T19:12:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"976628462","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976628462"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 16, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Fans of 2010's \"The Social Network\" and Disney's 2013 blockbuster hit, \"Frozen\" can rejoice as there is finally a family-friendly film about the modern world of computers (and expression through emoticons!), combined with a whirlwind of animated fun and romance for both adults and children alike. \"The Emoji Movie\" is a truly incredible cinematic experience! As you're transported into the world of emojis, you'll feel the love, sadness, hope, desperation, and joy (all different emojis!) that truly captures the heart of every audience member. You'll be brought to tears as you witness the journey of self discovery for the main emoji character, Gene. Heartfelt romance combined with the relatable pubescent struggles of the not-so-ordinary-emoji will truly leave a mark as you exit the emoji world and journey back to reality when you leave the theatre. Don't miss out on what just might be 2017's biggest hit!","displayName":"Rachel G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-16T19:09:56.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-16T19:29:55.000Z","user":{"userId":"976628459","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rachel G","accountLink":"/user/id/976628459"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 16, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"this is a fucking shit movie.","displayName":"David L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-16T18:21:58.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-16T18:21:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"936239773","realm":"RT","displayName":"David L","accountLink":"/user/id/936239773"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 16, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Amazin 10/10 July 28th","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/760154107490357/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-16T18:12:35.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-16T18:13:02.000Z","user":{"userId":"976628344","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976628344"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 16, 2017"}]}
