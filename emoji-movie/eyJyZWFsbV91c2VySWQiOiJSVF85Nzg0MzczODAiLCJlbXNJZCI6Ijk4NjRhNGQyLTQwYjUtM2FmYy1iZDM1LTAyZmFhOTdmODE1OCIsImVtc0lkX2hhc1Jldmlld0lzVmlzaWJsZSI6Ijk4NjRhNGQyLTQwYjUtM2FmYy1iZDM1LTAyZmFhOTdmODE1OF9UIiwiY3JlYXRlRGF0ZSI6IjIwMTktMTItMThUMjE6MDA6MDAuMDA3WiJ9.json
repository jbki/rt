The voice acting was great, the jokes were hilarious and the animation was perfect. I cannot express how funny this movie is. I was laughing the whole time. The animation was stellar, and the storytelling was better than Bambi. I don't even want to watch Disney movies anymore because this movie was so good. I can't believe people didn't like this movie. I saw it in theaters 12 times and it was worth every penny. I am very poor now, but it was totally worth it.

The \"plot\", \"story\", \"themes\" and \"characters\" are unoriginal and interesting allowing for a boring, drawn-out viewing experience. The themes in this movie are blatantly obvious, as \"be yourself, be different\", themes that have been tried and tested in hundreds of better movies resulting in an interesting and developed story. The Emoji Movie lacks care for it's \"plot\", and doesn't develop any of the characters into relatable people, leaving a viewer bored and tired by the end of the viewing.","displayName":"William L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/165659504796603/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-08T04:41:27.866Z","updateDate":"2019-12-08T04:41:27.866Z","user":{"userId":"978423008","realm":"RT","displayName":"William L","accountLink":"/user/id/978423008"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This movie is an abomination against humanity and must be wiped from existence so that no one else dies of this stupidity.","displayName":"Levi N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T16:36:52.278Z","updateDate":"2019-12-05T15:55:29.088Z","user":{"userId":"978033230","realm":"RT","displayName":"Levi N","accountLink":"/user/id/978033230"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Very cute, actually.
