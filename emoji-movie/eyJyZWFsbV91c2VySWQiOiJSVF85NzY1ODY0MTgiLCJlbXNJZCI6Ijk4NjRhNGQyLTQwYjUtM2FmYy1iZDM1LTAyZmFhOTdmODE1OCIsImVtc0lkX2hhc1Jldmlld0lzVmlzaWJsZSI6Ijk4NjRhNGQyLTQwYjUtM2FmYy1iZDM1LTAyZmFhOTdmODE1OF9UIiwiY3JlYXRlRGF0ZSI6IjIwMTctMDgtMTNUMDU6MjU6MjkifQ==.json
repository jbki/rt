This film is the Citizen Kane of animation. My entire childhood was devoid of such good movies. I just wish that I had a film that I enjoyed as much as this when I was a child. My favorite movie used to be Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, however after seeing this film I realized, that film was so unsatisfactory that my life until I saw that movie was, empty! But now that I have a true understanding of the standard of a good film, I truly feel like my life is complete.","displayName":"J U","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-12T19:51:46.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-12T20:15:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"976620000","realm":"RT","displayName":"J U","accountLink":"/user/id/976620000"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 12, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"If I could describe this movie in a word, it would be \"rollercoaster\". Why? Because that's the emotional distress/enjoyment you'll be put in. The meme factor and bad factor combined make your brain not understand your own thoughts. It's a must see, just for the emotional factors.I can't describe it in words, it's a masterpiece.

Only good part about the movie is the animation. To be honest, the animation isn't bad.
