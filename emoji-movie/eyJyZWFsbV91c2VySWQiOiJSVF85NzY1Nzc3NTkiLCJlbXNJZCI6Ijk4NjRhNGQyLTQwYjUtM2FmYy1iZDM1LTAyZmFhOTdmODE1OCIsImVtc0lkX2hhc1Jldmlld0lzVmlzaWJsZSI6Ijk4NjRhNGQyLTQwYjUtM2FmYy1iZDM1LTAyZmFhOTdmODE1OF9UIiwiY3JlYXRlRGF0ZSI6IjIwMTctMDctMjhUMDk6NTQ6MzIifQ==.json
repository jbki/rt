The slick animation hides underneath a cold dead film, a Frankenstein's monster crafted by lazy film executives to capitalize on a marketing buzzword. The script is so bland it feels like something a film student wrote for an assignment (and proceeded to get a D on). It's pretty clear this was just some generic script they pulled out of a pile, changed a few specific details and character names to fit the aquired brand name and sent off to the animation department. This is the definition of lazy machine film making. No one involved in this project put in any effort aside from the voice actors, but they can't save this lifeless corporate product. It also doesn't help that the film is filled with licensed pop music from a few years ago (almost like this film was planned half a decade ago and is just getting squeezed out now). Honestly the worst thing about this movie is that it got made instead of that really good looking Popeye movie by genndy tartakovsky (which now won't likely come out since tartakovsky dropped out of the project). All in all it's a shit movie made by shit people for lazy audiences too dimwitted to care that they're watching trash. Take your kid to see Spider-Man again or go to an amusement park or something.","displayName":"Jim M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-28T09:31:47.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T09:45:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"921520353","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jim M","accountLink":"/user/id/921520353"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I wasn't expecting much.
