There are a few good jokes sprinkled in here and there, but most of the time, I just wanna kill myself when I have to watch this movie (my sis loves it ????). \nMind numbingly boring and cringy to me for most of the duration of the movie, but it had its (half) decent moments.

I went into watching this very upset that Sony cancelled Popeye to make this, but I was wrong! Screw Popeye, this film is the best film ever.
