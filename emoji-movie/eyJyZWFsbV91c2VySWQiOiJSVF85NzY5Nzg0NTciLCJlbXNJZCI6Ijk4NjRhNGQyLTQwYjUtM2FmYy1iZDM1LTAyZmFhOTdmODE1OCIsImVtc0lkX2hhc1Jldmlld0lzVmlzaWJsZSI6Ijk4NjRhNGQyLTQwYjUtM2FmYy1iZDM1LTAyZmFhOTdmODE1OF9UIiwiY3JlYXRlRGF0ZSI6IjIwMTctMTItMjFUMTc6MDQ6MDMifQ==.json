Little did I know this movie was going to be absolutely terrible! Was the plot written for cardboard? Because that was so bland. I'm sorry to say but Hollywood just farted this out. This is becoming increasingly apparent with most modern Hollywood movies. Its all to push some sort of agenda.","displayName":"Jérôme B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1140799515/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-12-19T13:40:06.000Z","updateDate":"2017-12-19T13:51:51.000Z","user":{"userId":"827287961","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jérôme B","accountLink":"/user/id/827287961"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 19, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Super lazy!!!!

Even though is was pretty bad I still liked the animation and voice over performances they were both great.

The emoji movie has great graphics and animation and the plot of the movie is simply fantastic. (No spoilers!) Gene and Wildstyle, I mean Jailbreak, are very well developed characters.
