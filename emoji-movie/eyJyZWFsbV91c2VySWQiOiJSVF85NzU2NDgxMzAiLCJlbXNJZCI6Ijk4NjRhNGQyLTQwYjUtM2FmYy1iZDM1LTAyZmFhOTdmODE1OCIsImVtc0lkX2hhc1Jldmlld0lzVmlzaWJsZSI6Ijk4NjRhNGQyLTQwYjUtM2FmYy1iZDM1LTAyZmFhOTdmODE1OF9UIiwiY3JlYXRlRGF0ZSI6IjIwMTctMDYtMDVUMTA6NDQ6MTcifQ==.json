I'd love to give it more praise but even if I did that I'd still be discrediting it to an extant. \"The emoji movie\" is a phenomenal comedy and emotional roller coaster. The character dynamic is beautifully portrayed and I love the analogy of emojis being sentient beings.

Someone actually came up with the story of this movie. They pitched it to executives. The executives bought it. They then hired screenwriters to pen a script, they then cast the film, they then got those actors and actresses to voice the film, the editors edited it, the marketers marketed it, and the distributor actually released the film for the entire world to see. That is just mind boggling to me.","displayName":"Robertson R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-06-05T08:01:29.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-02T15:52:04.000Z","user":{"userId":"975511029","realm":"RT","displayName":"Robertson R","accountLink":"/user/id/975511029"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 05, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Best movie of 2016 deserves an Oscar. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLol jk this is bad","displayName":"Carlitoast 2","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-06-04T20:40:10.000Z","updateDate":"2017-06-04T20:40:10.000Z","user":{"userId":"975453192","realm":"RT","displayName":"Carlitoast 2","accountLink":"/user/id/975453192"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 04, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Funny here and there and is definitely a kids movie.

This movie is finally here, it actually exists. This is by far the worst animated movie I've seen to date. Every line in this movie finds a way to be cringe somehow. The plot was god awful. It made no sense and there were so many plot holes that made me feel dumber trying to even answer them. I feel brain dead after watching this movie. Don't see it ever. It's so unfunny you have no idea. All of the jokes are basic cliche one liners that make you want to vomit. Everything about this movie fails in some way. Overall, I hated it so much that after the first twenty minutes I wanted to walk out and never look back. If I made a list of every embarrassing line and moment in this movie it would be bigger than the worlds population.","displayName":"Spencer S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-06-01T11:15:14.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-19T23:18:26.000Z","user":{"userId":"975855789","realm":"RT","displayName":"Spencer S","accountLink":"/user/id/975855789"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 01, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Very funny!

What are we supposed to watch next? \"The Fidget Spinner Movie\"? Come on, Hollywood. I watched this with my all famiyl in theatres nd I can asure you, this is not offensivey bad, but it is surely bad, childish and a \"classic\" Snoy rip-off of other good animated features like Zootopia, Inside Out and Shrek. It's sad that we have come to this point. Adults might think my generation and the younger one are composed by idiots who want just to send emojis to each other.","displayName":"Francisco Q","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-06-01T00:39:06.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-13T21:27:00.000Z","user":{"userId":"976126568","realm":"RT","displayName":"Francisco Q","accountLink":"/user/id/976126568"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jun 01, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"There is only one reaction for this film: Meh.  When a young emoji, Eugene Meh, is given the opportunity to be on the phone for his first time, he malfunctions.  (Wreck-It-Ralph)  He has multiple emotions in his one-tone town and that is a problem.\nThe filmmakers probably looked at The Lego Movie for ideas of how to turn this fad into a film.  Unfortunately, unlike Lord and Miller, they lacked imagination to develop a larger story, like the Will Ferrell scenes, which gave the film heart and soul.  It added context and relevance.  The Emoji Movie just strung together shout outs and had no relevance go either the \"reel world\" or the reality.","displayName":"Lenard W","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1215589855/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-05-31T17:36:15.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-27T18:38:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"838139252","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lenard W","accountLink":"/user/id/838139252"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"May 31, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"that is wickedly awesome movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","displayName":"Erin C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-05-31T11:11:48.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T13:12:58.000Z","user":{"userId":"975468429","realm":"RT","displayName":"Erin C","accountLink":"/user/id/975468429"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"May 31, 2017"}]}
