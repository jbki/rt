They said \"oh yeah throw a little bit of emoji swag in there, some YouTube crap, famous actors, instagram, twitter, dank memes, all the good stuff.\" Most of the joke were pretty bland and unfunny. To be honest, I smiled twice and I don't even remember when. See, that's how forgettable this movie was. It just like they didn't care. Don't get me wrong, the animation it pretty nice. But that's like the only good thing in this movie. I guess it had some sort of charm to it? I don't know, I guess I'm just giving 3 starts cause I'm nice.","displayName":"Cathy%20 R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T22:32:26.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T22:38:50.000Z","user":{"userId":"976584675","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cathy%20 R","accountLink":"/user/id/976584675"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best movie, moved my ever so icy heart.

My favourite jokes were \"I'm gonna go throw myself on the barbie!\" Says the shrimp, as he throws himself on a BBQ where all his friends are. Another one was when the Poop Emoji and his son come out of the washroom and his son asks \"should we wash our hands?\" And Poop replies with \"No! Of course not!\" As they both start laughing and chant \"We're number 2!\" I died at that part! oh btw who only went becuz of jacksfilms yeah it was garbage \nbut the memes were good so 5/5","displayName":"Angus M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T22:14:34.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T22:19:30.000Z","user":{"userId":"976584632","realm":"RT","displayName":"Angus M","accountLink":"/user/id/976584632"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is absolutely awe-inspiring. Never have I seen such a masterful piece of cinema. The pure EMOJtions that this movie conveys are so real and visceral. I can't describe what makes this movie so utterly amazing, but what I can say is that you need to see this movie right this instant. Unless you haven't a single brain cell, you'll see this movie right now. A magnum opus for all of cinema. A pop masterpiece.","displayName":"Mitchell J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T22:13:41.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T22:25:24.000Z","user":{"userId":"976584629","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mitchell J","accountLink":"/user/id/976584629"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was an amazing movie","displayName":"Mya K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-07-29T22:08:33.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T22:09:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"976584616","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mya K","accountLink":"/user/id/976584616"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"If god doesn't exist, then how do you explain this?
