The storyline was okay, the animation is pretty clean, there is an A-list cast like T.J Miller and James Corden. I gave it 4 and a half stars because of the Just Dance part with Christina Aguilera in it, it didn't have that Just Dance feel to it but  other than that, this movie was absolutely amazing and I would love to see it again.","displayName":"Jermale D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-05-16T18:36:13.000Z","updateDate":"2018-05-16T18:42:38.000Z","user":{"userId":"977271856","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jermale D","accountLink":"/user/id/977271856"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 16, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Is this an excellent animated film?
