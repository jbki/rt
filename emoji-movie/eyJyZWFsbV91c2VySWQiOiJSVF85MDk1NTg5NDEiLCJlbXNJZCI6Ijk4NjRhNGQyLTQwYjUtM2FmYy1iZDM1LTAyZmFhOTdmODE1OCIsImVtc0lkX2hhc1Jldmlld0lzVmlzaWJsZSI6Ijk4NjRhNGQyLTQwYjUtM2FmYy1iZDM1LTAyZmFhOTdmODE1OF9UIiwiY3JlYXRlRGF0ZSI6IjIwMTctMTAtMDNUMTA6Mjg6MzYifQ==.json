I was bringing in 6 figures, I had a happy marriage, and no debt. My credit was perfect, I owned a cabin in northern Oregon, and loved exercising and maintaining a completely organic diet. After seeing this movie my life instantly began to decline. After seeing this movie on the release date I have since lost my job after punching my boss because I found a text message on my wife's phone from him that contained a kissy emoji. I quickly developed an alcohol habit that ended up joining up with a taste for heroin after my prescription I received for a slipped disc expired. I began to drown in debt as I had zero income and started shoveling all my assets to fund my alcohol, heroin and sex line habits. I inadvertently burned down my cabin and 4 acres of forest after tripping on mushrooms for the first time. I now owe millions of dollars to a loan shark who broke all my fingers (my crack mamma Julie is typing this for me). My diet consists of the remnants of meat on KFC chicken bones I salvage from a dumpster on skid row. I am convinced this movie is cursed because the night after watching it the \"meh\" emoji appeared in a dream and told me it would now be in charge of my life. It has appeared every night since seeing the film. I can only wait for deaths sweet release. Every night I try to choke on a chicken bone and fail...fuck you emoji movie.","displayName":"Cole L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1291883892/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-01T16:53:43.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-01T16:59:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"875720156","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cole L","accountLink":"/user/id/875720156"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 01, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"THE EMOJI MOVIE IS MY NEW FAVORITE MOVIE EVER!","displayName":"DARIUS L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-10-01T04:12:24.000Z","updateDate":"2017-11-17T14:19:32.000Z","user":{"userId":"976730177","realm":"RT","displayName":"DARIUS L","accountLink":"/user/id/976730177"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 01, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Emoji Movie es una pelicula la cual quiere verse como buena pero no sabe como hacerlo y falla en muchos aspectos plagiando estereotipos de otras peliculas como Ralph el demoledor, Intensamente,Chicken Little,La era de Hielo y sobre todo La gran aventura LEGO.

My 7 y.o. daughter, however, had other ideas. Following Gene (T.J. Miller), a malfunctioning 'meh' emoji who can't control his vast range of emotions, we enter the working world of a smartphone whereby every tap of the screen requires a functioning digital population to make it happen. In a universe where everyone (everything?) has its place, Gene is ridiculed for his expressiveness and, after sending out the wrong emoji for his user (Alex, a teenage boy in the midst of his first romance), must go on the run from the delete-happy Smiler (Maya Rudolph). Ostensibly an adventure comedy, there is neither enough thrills to make it exciting or enough laughs to make it amusing; ironically falling into a zone of complete meh-ness. The jokes about twitter, internet trolls and the controlling nature of smartphones in modern society would have been astute a few years ago, in 2017 they're already out-dated and tired. And the target audience for this film wont understand them anyway. Thankfully there are some hilarious visual gags like the poop emoji exiting the toilet... oh wait, nope, even that is old and boring, barely getting a titter from the packed cinema of kids (and parents regretting their choice) ready to laugh at just about anything. The animation is unsurprisingly bright and James Corden's sidekick Hi-5 adds a smidge of delight, however The Emoji Movie ultimately has less flavour and value-for-money than the watered-down soft drink and over-priced popcorn from the cinema's candy bar.","displayName":"Troy C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-09-30T15:55:14.000Z","updateDate":"2017-09-30T15:55:16.000Z","user":{"userId":"901318118","realm":"RT","displayName":"Troy C","accountLink":"/user/id/901318118"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 30, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"No NO NO!
