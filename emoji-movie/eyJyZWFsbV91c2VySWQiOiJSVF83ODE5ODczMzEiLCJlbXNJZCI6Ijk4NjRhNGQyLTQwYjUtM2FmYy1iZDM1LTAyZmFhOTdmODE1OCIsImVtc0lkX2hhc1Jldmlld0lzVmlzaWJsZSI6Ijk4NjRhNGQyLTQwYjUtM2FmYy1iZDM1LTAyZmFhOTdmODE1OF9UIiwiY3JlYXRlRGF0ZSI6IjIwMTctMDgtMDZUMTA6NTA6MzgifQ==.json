Jailbreak is sexy, independent, absolutely, astoundingly gorgeous and that's the least interesting thing about her! She's also a great feminist icon and gene is handsome and fuckable. Hi-5 is the best comedy relief I've ever seen! Smiler is my new waifu >3< she's a great villain and really brings the story to life. Also, the devil is hilarious ????????!

A lot of inside jokes for parents and super entertaining for kids. There's a feminism thread woven in the movie  which I appreciated.

It is an emoji movie, obviously it is going to have an adventure in apps, but ads on a phone says download today, but it never said that in it? It doesn't have to be funny to be a good movie. This film is a fun adventure around alex's phone and it has these apps: The text app, which is the home of the emojis, Candy Crush, Just Dance, Spotify, Facebook, a twitter bird, photos and Dropbox. It is a really good film.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10154497079581468/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-06T02:42:55.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-06T02:54:09.000Z","user":{"userId":"976604160","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976604160"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 06, 2017"}]}
