I literally found nothing redeemable in this movie. I thought the story tried to convey a message that has been hundreds of times and has been absolutely executed much better in the past. The story is exceptionally boring and I found myself just waiting for the movie to end. It's repetitive and not one bit of it is compelling. I could not get emotionally invested in a feature on your phone. A majority of the characters are one-note (what do you expect from emojis anyway?!) and it makes it hard to truly empathize at any point. I also didn't find myself laughing even once during the entirety of this movie. Every joke is just a goofy pun and it gets old really fast. It was a movie that no one asked for and that no one should go see. It's not only the worst movie I've seen this year so far, it's the worst movie in a very long time. It's an unfunny, uncharismatic, and uninvolving animated feature that does not deserve your time or money.","displayName":"Yash B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000592764041/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-05-07T01:41:42.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-02T15:14:42.000Z","user":{"userId":"915900746","realm":"RT","displayName":"Yash B","accountLink":"/user/id/915900746"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"May 07, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Wow what is our world coming to","displayName":"w0Rk F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-05-04T14:31:50.000Z","updateDate":"2017-05-04T14:32:22.000Z","user":{"userId":"976323942","realm":"RT","displayName":"w0Rk F","accountLink":"/user/id/976323942"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"May 04, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"I knew this movie would be terrible ever since I saw the first teaser of this, a horrible plot and unfunny humor.

It had really incredible animation, really superb voice cast, really great characters, really excellent humor, really fun adventure, really awesome visuals, really great music and a really original storyline. In my opinion, I think it's the best and funniest animated movie of the year in my whole life. I also would like to call it a masterpiece. I really recommend this movie to both kids and adults.","displayName":"Chris M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-04-01T14:58:47.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-29T14:21:45.000Z","user":{"userId":"909943338","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris M","accountLink":"/user/id/909943338"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Apr 01, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Come on Nintendo, first you won't put Halo on the switch and now you give us this!?","displayName":"Sean M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-03-22T15:08:18.000Z","updateDate":"2017-07-28T15:07:06.000Z","user":{"userId":"973409710","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sean M","accountLink":"/user/id/973409710"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 22, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"The film director probably has autism","displayName":"Damion G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-03-12T17:36:00.000Z","updateDate":"2017-03-12T17:36:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"976158005","realm":"RT","displayName":"Damion G","accountLink":"/user/id/976158005"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 12, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Me me big disappointment","displayName":"Meme M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-03-11T11:12:37.000Z","updateDate":"2017-10-08T22:26:56.000Z","user":{"userId":"974523876","realm":"RT","displayName":"Meme M","accountLink":"/user/id/974523876"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 11, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Not as awful as I expected I guess","displayName":"Evan G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-03-10T12:54:51.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-27T19:02:37.000Z","user":{"userId":"965846379","realm":"RT","displayName":"Evan G","accountLink":"/user/id/965846379"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Mar 10, 2017"}]}
