By now, you've already read the reviews. You know you aren't going to see it unironically. So let's just cut straight to the point. This movie sucks. It is one of the worst I've seen. I did not have stomach pains before watching this movie. Coming out, I felt some of the worst physical pain I've ever felt- worse than broken ribs. I have not cried at an animated film since The Lion King. About 40 minutes in, I began bawling because I spent nine whole dollars on this movie. I will not spoil it in case for some reason, you want to see this godless piece of the most atrocious animated garbage I've ever seen. The Emoji Movie. Please don't.","displayName":"Dustin D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-03T19:41:38.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-03T19:49:36.000Z","user":{"userId":"931692934","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dustin D","accountLink":"/user/id/931692934"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 03, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"If I can laugh, cry and pray in the same 90 minutes then that's money well spent","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/134308393836106/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-03T18:44:41.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-03T18:45:07.000Z","user":{"userId":"976597437","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/976597437"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 03, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I a fates in a move and it is funny in a move to and it is love store in a move.","displayName":"Peggy G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1442331439159779/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-03T18:11:07.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-03T18:16:44.000Z","user":{"userId":"976410771","realm":"RT","displayName":"Peggy G","accountLink":"/user/id/976410771"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 03, 2017"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"have t seen it. don't plan on it. very obvious reasons why","displayName":"Max Z","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2017-08-03T18:10:35.000Z","updateDate":"2017-08-03T18:10:35.000Z","user":{"userId":"976597329","realm":"RT","displayName":"Max Z","accountLink":"/user/id/976597329"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 03, 2017"}]}
