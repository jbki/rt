Honestly, this is the worst dumpster fire of a movie in recent memory. Like, not even \"oh it's for kids\" bad, it's \"I wouldn't show this to my kids\" bad. The characters are forgettable, the plot is maddeningly lost and poorly put together, the voice acting is uninspired, the message is confused, and I didn't even make it 20 minutes into this crapfest. I gave up after 20 minutes.... AFTER NEVER LEAVING A MOVIE BEFORE! I SAT THROUGH MOVIES LIKE \"KNOWING\" AND \"SECRET LIFE OF PETS\" WITHOUT MOVING.\n\nThis crushed my soul into a dark oblivion in less time than it takes to crush the soul of a high school student in Algebra 2.","displayName":"Drew B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-24T14:02:53.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-24T14:07:33.000Z","user":{"userId":"977372494","realm":"RT","displayName":"Drew B","accountLink":"/user/id/977372494"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 24, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"I want to meet the person who made this, and give him a \"hi-5\" in the face!","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/146767066210030/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-23T08:26:25.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-23T08:27:19.000Z","user":{"userId":"977376250","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/977376250"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 23, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Aaaaaaaaaaaa so cool","displayName":"Lucas S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-22T05:21:07.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-22T05:21:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"977373660","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lucas S","accountLink":"/user/id/977373660"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 22, 2018"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Watched it today cause I got curious and as you'd guess The Emoji Movie is not a great movie at all but is only alright.

Ironically enough, I was so flabberaghasted by the sheer pandering stupidity of this lifeless crud, so caught up watching this utter train wreck crash from one lazy idea to the next, that I never even felt the need to pick up my phone and distract myself. Really, this is astoundingly dumb, just one bad choice after another, but in a \"so bad it's still moderately entertaining\" kind of way.\n\nOf course, as \"Sausage Party\" and \"Toy Story\" have shown, there is great potential in showing the secret adventures of everyday objects, and one can easily imagine interesting stories of one emoji trying to rescue another from being discontinued, or an underused emoji leading a social revolt (with slow time consequences) against the more popular ones-ideas already minimally hinted at here. The problem, rather, is that the movie makes the truly idiotic decision to make a lack of characters central to the plot: The emojis are defined by their flatness, the monotony, their total lack of growth and change-this never even gets challenged, but is the norm for the whole runtime, which ends up feeling totally devoid of not just intelligence, but any life whatsoever.","displayName":"Jake C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10100158086500388/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2018-07-18T10:30:51.000Z","updateDate":"2018-07-18T10:30:53.000Z","user":{"userId":"976528324","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jake C","accountLink":"/user/id/976528324"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 18, 2018"}]}
