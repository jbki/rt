I did like it better than the third movie overall, but I felt it was an unnecessary addition to the franchise and destroys all the messages of the previous movies. \n(Spoilers ahead...)\nMy main issues were as follows:\nFirstly it makes no sense to me that Bonnie would play with every toy except Woody, especially after she seemed so interested in playing with him in the third movie. Secondly, the whole voice box thing rubbed me the wrong way how Gabbie Gabbie blackmailed him to get it and not only kept it bu the end of the movie but also got a happy ending... it just kinda felt very off to me. I think it wouldve been more powerful if shed found a kid without needing the voice box... sends a better message of not needing to fix yourself to find a friend. That goes against the message of the precious movies, especially the second where theyd always say Andy will love you no matter what and Woody dealt with his arm being ripped and Andy still wanting to play with him regardless. Lastly, the idea Woody would just leave the entire gang of toys for Bo seems a bit out of character. And goes against the main theme of the other three films. Overall, I did like the movie due to the sheer amazement I had watching Pixars animation quality progress and come such a long way, but story wise it felt more like a fanfiction than something true to what gave Toy Story its heart in the first place and so fell flat.","displayName":"Moki","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-04T09:01:27.373Z","updateDate":"2019-08-04T09:01:27.373Z","user":{"userId":"74b99079-92e8-4bd0-8b68-779a005df851","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Moki","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"La mejor pel√≠cula que e visto hasta me hizo llorarü§©","displayName":"Ieshua P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2339220136351185/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-04T08:01:18.675Z","updateDate":"2019-08-04T08:01:18.675Z","user":{"userId":"978185642","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ieshua P","accountLink":"/user/id/978185642"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A funny, sweet and family oriented movie.","displayName":"Helen P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-04T07:48:48.716Z","updateDate":"2019-08-04T07:48:48.716Z","user":{"userId":"cca3dea3-e771-42a5-9254-fffeb978349d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Helen P","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 04, 2019"}]}
