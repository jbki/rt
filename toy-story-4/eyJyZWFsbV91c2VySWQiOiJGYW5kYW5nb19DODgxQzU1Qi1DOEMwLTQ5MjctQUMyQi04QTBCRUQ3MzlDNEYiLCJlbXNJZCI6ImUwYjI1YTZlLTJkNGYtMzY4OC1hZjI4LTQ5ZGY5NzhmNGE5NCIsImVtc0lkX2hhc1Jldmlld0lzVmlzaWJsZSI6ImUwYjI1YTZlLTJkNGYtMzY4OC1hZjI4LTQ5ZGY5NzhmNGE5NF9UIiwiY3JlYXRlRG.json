All our favorites were represented and we even got a nostalgic visit from Andy (via flashback). Loved the plot too! Fitting and fulfilling to see Woody, who has loyally and steadfastly spent the entirety of the last 20 years looking out for his kid and all his friends, finally reach the point in his, er, life where he makes a decision about what is best for him and his happiness! Had to have been at least 4 scenes in the last 20 minutes that could jerk a tear from darn near anyone with a pulse. This felt very final (I know we all felt that way about Toy Story 3 though), but at last in that ending our main characters were all still together so continuing the story with the right idea could work. Now it feels FINAL. I know money carries the day on Hollywood, but I hope the powers that be let the sorry rest now...if so, awesome, Dare I say, perfect finale!","displayName":"Ryan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-15T04:33:22.254Z","updateDate":"2019-07-15T04:33:22.911Z","user":{"userId":"fd649339-a9bc-415f-8159-5a3218b18e34","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ryan","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"While it was a fine movie, it didn't really have the heart of the third (and what should have been the final) installment.","displayName":"Tiffany T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-15T04:31:40.620Z","updateDate":"2019-07-15T04:31:40.620Z","user":{"userId":"BB0E0C21-52EB-43F3-9AE5-6222E3C2D389","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tiffany T","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Although not entirely a necessary instalment to the well-loved franchise, Toy Story 4 is definitely hilarious, heart felt and leaves you feeling warm inside.
