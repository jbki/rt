Toy Story has probably overstayed its welcome but this was a cute movie. It had an unusual ending but overal it is another good Disney production.

The animation is great and the characters are bursting with personality! The cinematography is stunning and i love the colours. But this film lacks the relatable story the other three have. And tries a bit too hard to be a “Pixar film” (it tries too hard to make you cry) this does work on one or two occasions, but sometimes they do this to a point where it distracts from the actual movie.
