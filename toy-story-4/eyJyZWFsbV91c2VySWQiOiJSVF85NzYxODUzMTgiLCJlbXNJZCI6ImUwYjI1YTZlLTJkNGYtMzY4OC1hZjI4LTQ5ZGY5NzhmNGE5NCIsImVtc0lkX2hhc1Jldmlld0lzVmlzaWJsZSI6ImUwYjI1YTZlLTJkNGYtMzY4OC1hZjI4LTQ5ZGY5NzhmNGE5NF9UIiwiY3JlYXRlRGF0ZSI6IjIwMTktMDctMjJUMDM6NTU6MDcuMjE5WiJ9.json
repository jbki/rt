Absolutely loved the new characters Duke Caboom, ducky, bunny, and gabby gabby. The skunk mobile was super creative and a hilarious way for the toys to move around. Bo Peep was phenomenal, literally the best version of her I think we'll ever see. This was clearly a movie all about woody and I gotta say I am happy for him for what he chose at the end but at the same time I'm upset that they split up the group. I'm also a bit upset that the majority of the older characters didn't get much screen time at all. This movie could easily be setting up new beginnings for a 5th iteration in the franchise. Only time will tell but I'm game to return to these characters again.
