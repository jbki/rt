I was not expecting greatness again - and surprise ! It was fabulous, gorgeous, witty, moving and unpredictable.\n\nPixar keeps improving their skills. The writing, helmed by Andrew Stanton, is excellent and the actors - especially Hanks (who owns this one completely ) have never been better. I can't believe what I'm saying, but I love these 'cartoons'. They are better than regular movies. TS3 was my favourite film of its year of release and it will take a hell of a movie to better this. Please read all of the critic reviews and audience reviews if you like. I can't say which one is my favourite, but this is right up there with the best.\n\nA lot of hate for Disney these days, but just think....Marvel. Star Wars. Pixar. Lion King. Aladdin. I mean, it's ridiculous the way Disney has cornered popular entertainment without dropping quality. If anyone can remember anyone else doing this before, I am happy to hear about it.","displayName":"Richard B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1150902893/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-07-22T16:14:23.059Z","updateDate":"2019-07-22T16:14:23.059Z","user":{"userId":"953525032","realm":"RT","displayName":"Richard B","accountLink":"/user/id/953525032"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"This was an absolute tragedy.

But Bo's strengths are many and threaten to overwhelm and displace Woody's desire. She's a fiercely independent feminist, having been \"on her own,\" beyond the security of a child's bedroom, for 7 years. She's an athlete and a warrior, using her hook as a both a weapon and climbing device. Bo and other independent toys travel around in a mechanical skunk. These \"Independent Toys,\" which exist somewhere between \"Lost Toys\" and \"Toys who have a Kid,\" are a new category for the franchise.\n\nDuke Caboom, Ducky and Bunny are solid and funny additions to the \"Toy Story\" crew, but on the whole the cast is too large and dispenses with too many familiar characters to achieve the kind of focus that shaped previous editions.\n\nThese caveats aside, \"Toy Story 4\" is almost as good as its predecessors - and that's saying something.","displayName":"Dianne B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-22T15:49:57.067Z","updateDate":"2019-07-22T15:49:57.067Z","user":{"userId":"977942067","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dianne B","accountLink":"/user/id/977942067"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 22, 2019"}]}
