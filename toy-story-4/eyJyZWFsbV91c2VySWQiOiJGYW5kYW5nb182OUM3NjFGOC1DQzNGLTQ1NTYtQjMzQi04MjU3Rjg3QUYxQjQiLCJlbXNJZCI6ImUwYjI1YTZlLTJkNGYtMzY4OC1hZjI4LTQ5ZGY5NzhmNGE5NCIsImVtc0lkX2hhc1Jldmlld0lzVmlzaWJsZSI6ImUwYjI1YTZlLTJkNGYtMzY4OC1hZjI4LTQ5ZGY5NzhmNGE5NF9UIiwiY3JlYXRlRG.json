I love all the adult humor and heart warming moments. I felt like the \"bad guy\" was too similar to Toy Story 3...only nicer.

Protagonist is a female sheepherder who rudely bosses around male characters. The cowboy, or \"poster character\" of this franchise constantly apologies to her, and follows orders, demonstrates low value and weak frame of mind. If you have SONS do not take them to see this movie - it provides a terrible role model for male behavior and interaction with a group.","displayName":"Max L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-06T11:39:32.144Z","updateDate":"2019-07-06T11:39:32.144Z","user":{"userId":"977905368","realm":"RT","displayName":"Max L","accountLink":"/user/id/977905368"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Slow, not overly funny.","displayName":"Rob G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-06T10:55:06.460Z","updateDate":"2019-07-06T10:55:06.460Z","user":{"userId":"fd9620fe-3905-46d7-86c4-5d5c95a8b1d0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rob G","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Our beloved Woody didn't realize he was lost until he found where he belonged.
