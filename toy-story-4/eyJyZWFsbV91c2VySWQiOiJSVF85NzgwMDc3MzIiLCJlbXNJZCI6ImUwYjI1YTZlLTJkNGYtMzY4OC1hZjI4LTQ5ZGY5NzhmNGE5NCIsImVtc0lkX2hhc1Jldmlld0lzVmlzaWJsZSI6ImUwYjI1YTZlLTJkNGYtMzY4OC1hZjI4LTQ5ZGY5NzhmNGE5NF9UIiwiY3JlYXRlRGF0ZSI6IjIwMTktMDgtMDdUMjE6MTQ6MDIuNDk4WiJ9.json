I like the series and the characters enough that I enjoyed it however I didnâ€™t think it was as good as the rest of the series. The voice acting is good and it had some funny parts but not enough. The full redemption of the doll was nice and all but it didnâ€™t feel realistic to me. I recommend for kids and fans of the series.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-07T12:59:03.588Z","updateDate":"2019-08-07T12:59:03.588Z","user":{"userId":"968234361","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/968234361"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The franchise never disappoints!
