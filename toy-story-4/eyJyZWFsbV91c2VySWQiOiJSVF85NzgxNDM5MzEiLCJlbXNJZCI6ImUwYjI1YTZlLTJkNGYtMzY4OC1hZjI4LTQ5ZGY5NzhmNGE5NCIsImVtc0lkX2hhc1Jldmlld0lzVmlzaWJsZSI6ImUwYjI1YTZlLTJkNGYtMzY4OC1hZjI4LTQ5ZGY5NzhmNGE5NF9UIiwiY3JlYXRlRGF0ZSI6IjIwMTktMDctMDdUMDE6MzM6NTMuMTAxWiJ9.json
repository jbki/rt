The spork character just doesn‚Äôt work and is jarringly different in tone from the rest of the movie. This was true for the bunny and bird characters as well. Too many narrative threads happening at once, but none of which seemed particularly urgent or compelling. None of the funny sarcasm was present that made the original so great. The ‚Äúvillain‚Äù ends up not being villainous at all, making the story completely without tension or climax.

It had all the wholesome tropes of its predecessors but lacked the emotional weight so well established by the previous three films. Overall, I dont think this film was particularly necessary, especially with such a great ending in Toy Story 3. But, this movie isnt offensive like other unnecessary sequels (Im looking at you Terminator Genisys). Id say take the family to see it, and youd be hard pressed to find anyone who didnt find at least some enjoyment in this nice little film.","displayName":"Connor","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T01:09:41.649Z","updateDate":"2019-07-07T01:09:41.649Z","user":{"userId":"9a9bf83d-ce0c-4903-bad3-c44cbc9aeabb","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Connor","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"It was okay.
