As many have said it isn't quite as emotional as the end of the 3rd film, however I couldn't but get a little teary eyed not at Bopeep and Woody, but at Buzz and Woody's goodbye. I grew up on the original 3 movies and although I adore this film and it is probably the 2nd best to date (after the 2nd of course). However, I can't help but ask them not to make another. I feel that if the studio pushes for another simply because they do well it will make the films loose their unique magic. I do appriciate the gap between the 3rd and 4th, but I hope it is atleast another 5 years if number 5 comes out. Please don't let it loose the magic that made all 4 films so special to me and others.","displayName":"Karl C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/3161518523865581/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-17T22:56:27.239Z","updateDate":"2019-11-17T22:56:31.761Z","user":{"userId":"978377956","realm":"RT","displayName":"Karl C","accountLink":"/user/id/978377956"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Following up from \"Toy Story 3\" was never going to be easy and although this is a good film in its own right, it pales in comparison to the previous installment of the franchise.
