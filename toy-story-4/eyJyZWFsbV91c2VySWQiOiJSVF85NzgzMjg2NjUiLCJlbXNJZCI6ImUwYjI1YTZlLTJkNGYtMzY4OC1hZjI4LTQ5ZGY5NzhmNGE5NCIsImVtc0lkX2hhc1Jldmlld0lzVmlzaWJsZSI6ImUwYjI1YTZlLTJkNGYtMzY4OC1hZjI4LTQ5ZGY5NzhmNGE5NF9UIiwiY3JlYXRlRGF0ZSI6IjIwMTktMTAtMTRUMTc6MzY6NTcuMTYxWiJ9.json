I do agree it is heartwarming and it is beautifully animated but for everything else, I feel it's lacking. I didn't feel entertained throughout the movie. The only thing keeping me in my seat would've had to of been the name Toy Story in the title.\n\nIt was very cool to have a bit of Bo Peep's story unveiled after she was \"sold\" in Toy Story 3. I feel all the other characters were lacking their normal traits. Even Buzz didn't act like his normal self or even his space ranger self. Barely any of the old characters featured in this film which is what I feel was lacking a lot. It was Bo, Andy and the new characters, that's it.\n\n2 and a half stars from me. It's something that I can sit there and watch but won't enjoy watching it.","displayName":"Layne U","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-13T11:54:20.200Z","updateDate":"2019-10-13T11:55:03.518Z","user":{"userId":"978327652","realm":"RT","displayName":"Layne U","accountLink":"/user/id/978327652"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Forky makes this movie so funny.
