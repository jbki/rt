As you expect from Pixar the animation is awesome and the action-packed story better than I expected...with a quite unexpected ending but which for these cartoon characters makes sense and is courageous. All in all it has depth and kept the kids (with one exception!) entertained in the full house showing I was in. If I was nit-picking a little too much Woody and not enough Buzz Lightyear (and the other toys). Cool Bo Peep tho'. handling her crook well!","displayName":"Cal W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-08T10:28:41.236Z","updateDate":"2019-08-08T10:28:41.236Z","user":{"userId":"977485576","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cal W","accountLink":"/user/id/977485576"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Love the story and the ending.","displayName":"Pauline K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-08T10:11:48.540Z","updateDate":"2019-08-08T10:11:48.540Z","user":{"userId":"fb9ecb9e-5ed3-4b45-bb94-2a50e063d511","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Pauline K","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 08, 2019"}]}
