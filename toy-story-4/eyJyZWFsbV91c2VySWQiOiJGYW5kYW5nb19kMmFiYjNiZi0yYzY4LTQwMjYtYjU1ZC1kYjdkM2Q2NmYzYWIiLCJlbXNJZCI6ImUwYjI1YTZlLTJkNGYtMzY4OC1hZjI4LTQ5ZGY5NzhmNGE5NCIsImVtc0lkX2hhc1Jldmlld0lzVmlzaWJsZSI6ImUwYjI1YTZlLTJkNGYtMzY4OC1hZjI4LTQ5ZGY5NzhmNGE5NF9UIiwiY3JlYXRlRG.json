By the end of the movie, I was left wondering if this movie really needed to happen. The movie is very self-indulgent in the star power that it brings to the new toys, (Keanu Reeves and the comedy duo Key and Peele), in favor of the old toys that deserved screen time but were ultimately left neglected. Unlike the third movie, it isn't a perfect goodbye for the franchise, but still a welcome fourth installment.","displayName":"Jack B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-09T22:24:12.031Z","updateDate":"2019-07-09T22:24:12.031Z","user":{"userId":"977942023","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jack B","accountLink":"/user/id/977942023"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Toy Story 3 is still my favorite but a great time with my fiancé!","displayName":"Maria","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-09T22:24:04.770Z","updateDate":"2019-07-09T22:24:04.770Z","user":{"userId":"43B24859-AD0A-41C6-83D9-A36797F0E855","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Maria","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"cute but a little creepy","displayName":"shayna","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-09T22:16:50.859Z","updateDate":"2019-07-09T22:16:50.859Z","user":{"userId":"F0A68384-A025-497F-A1D0-900EE2568FA4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"shayna","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Not at all the ending I was expecting, but I sure did love it!!! ❤️","displayName":"Aimes","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-09T22:13:26.193Z","updateDate":"2019-07-09T22:13:26.193Z","user":{"userId":"C7D7DD1B-9D51-4C2F-AB99-F90854D8F72A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Aimes","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Heartwarming, beautiful, perfectly animated, excelent evolution of the history, perfect timing, perfect voices, new toys are funny and very well developed.
