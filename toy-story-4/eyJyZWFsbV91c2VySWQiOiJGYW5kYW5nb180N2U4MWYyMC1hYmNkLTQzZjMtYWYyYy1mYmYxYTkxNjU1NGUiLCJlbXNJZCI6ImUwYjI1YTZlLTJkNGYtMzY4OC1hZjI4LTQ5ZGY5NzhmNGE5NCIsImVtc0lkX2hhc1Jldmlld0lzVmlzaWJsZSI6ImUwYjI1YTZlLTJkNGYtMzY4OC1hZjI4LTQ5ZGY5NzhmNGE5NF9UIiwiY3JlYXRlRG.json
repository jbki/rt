The 3rd film was an emotionally rewarding send off for the series. The 4th film is forced for the simple goal of selling tickets more so than telling a story, and the end is lack-luster in the emotion department. Whereas 3 leaves you with tears in your eyes, 4 leaves you with a small grin on your face.","displayName":"Joseph S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-16T04:23:59.270Z","updateDate":"2019-07-16T04:23:59.270Z","user":{"userId":"51164c38-fedf-4676-9801-8efda3a66b9e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Joseph S","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The unexpected and sacrifical ending was the best...","displayName":"MAM","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-16T04:18:05.879Z","updateDate":"2019-07-16T04:18:05.879Z","user":{"userId":"b3203d73-3283-4c22-99e9-83ad3d3f28fa","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"MAM","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A good end to a great set.
