The lighting and shadows darting across Bo-Peep's facial features are a level of detail that can easily be taken for granted and it is fun to watch just to appreciate the spectacle and feat of CGI. \n\nThat said, though, it was a little questionable at first as to whether this film was needed. Nobody was really asking for Toy Story number 4 . When the news was announced that Disney and Pixar were doing it I remember wondering why, what story was left to tell? We had concluded the tale, Toy Story 3 was a beautiful end to an animated saga that had carried a generation through childhood into adolescence, and now they were creating a fourth? Could we, as an audience that had departed this train and exited the platform be bothered to get back on board? I mean, where was it even headed? We all know how this goes, Disney did it with Pirates of the Caribbean, a new trilogy of films that can't live up to the originals and succeed only in tainting the franchise.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised though to find myself exiting the cinema, having watched the most recent installment, with a sense of closure that I didn't even realise I needed.\n\nI mean think about it this way. The end of Toy Story 3 left Woody nodding a solemn farewell to Andy, about to jump into a new life with Bonnie, the adorable and excitable kindergartener who could help these toys continue fulfilling their purpose as children's playthings. It was a bittersweet end, we connected with Andy as he clung on desperately to the remnants of childhood, but were happy to see another child find joy in playing with the characters that we'd grown to love through 3 incredible movies. \n\nBut nobody was asking, yet probably should have been, what happens in 6 or 7 years time when Bonnie is too old to play with these toys? Are we going to have to pick up the story again and watch them all find a new home? And what about Bo-Peep? Where the heck is she? And what even defines a toy? Why are other seemingly inanimate objects in this franchise not sentient, and what happens if something that was not previously labelled a toy is suddenly redefined as one by a child playing with it?  \n\nToy Story 4, often horrifyingly, addresses all of these unanswered questions, and delivers a hilarious, emotional punch that nobody knew they needed. We are introduced to Forky, an agonised creation made from trash that suffers an existential crisis of identity whilst being, literally, talked down from the ledge by Woody. Somehow Disney turn this into a storyline that lasts 100 minutes, and though it felt more like the tying of several ends that I wasn't aware were even loose until they were picked up in this movie, it was nonetheless enjoyable to watch and entertaining throughout. Let us not forget, this is a kids film, and the giggles and laughter echoing through the screening are testament to the fact that this delivers to it's target audience. \n\nWill Toy Story 5 happen? Knowing Disney - yes. Should it? Probably not.","displayName":"Leo K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-11T18:03:47.394Z","updateDate":"2019-08-11T18:03:47.394Z","user":{"userId":"978195005","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leo K","accountLink":"/user/id/978195005"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Very enjoyable for children and adults","displayName":"peter m","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-11T17:54:40.494Z","updateDate":"2019-08-11T17:54:40.494Z","user":{"userId":"578C50AD-12FE-40CF-A27F-BD5BCC200CB7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"peter m","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"It was great!
