The plot felt very unpolished compared to Pixar's previous ventures with this franchise and it focused on introducing too many new characters that we had barely any screen time with any of the characters we actually care about. Woody didn't even really feel like Woody in this entry almost like Hanks had stopped caring about the role and/or was given a kind of lousy script. One of the most heartbreaking parts of this entry is that the relationships we really developed in the first two entries were forgotten about. Buzz and Woody had one scene of development together, that's it. I also feel like Buzz got the short end of the stick as far as I feel like they could have written him out of the script and nothing would have been lost as far as the plot is concerned. Jessie (never been my favorite character) also got maybe 2-3 minutes of actual screen time and a sentence or two of script. I can't even remember Bullseye being in the movie. Bonnie's new toys didn't get enough time to actually have much of a personality, the Key and Peele toys weren't that funny (suprisingly) and just cheapened the overall experience. Bo Peep was an annoying character for me. I am all for equality between genders but this just seems so tacked on and politically charged and irked me just like Belle in the live action's Beauty and the Beast or those Frozen girls. She was annoying to watch and had the same personality as every other Disney princess since Disney \"woke.\" The movie's only antagonist's story arch resolved with 20 minutes to go and she was utterly forgettable. Her dummy henchmen are going to be giving my boys nightmares for the rest of their lives and were definitely not something I expected to see in a family movie (and I'm not one to shelter my children from potentially scary scenes, looking at you shark attack in Finding Nemo). I'm surprised how high this has been rated and just don't see it. For me it ranks right around Monster's University on the Pixar lineup with Cars 2 (never saw 3) being one of the few below it. I even liked Finding Dory significantly more than this one and that was the movie that made me realize that Pixar has lost it's magic. If it weren't for Inside Out I probably wouldn't bother seeing any more of Pixar (or Disney for that matter) until they make some big changes.","displayName":"Sean C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1320618012/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T06:30:02.876Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T06:30:11.321Z","user":{"userId":"920673520","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sean C","accountLink":"/user/id/920673520"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"This was the first Toy Story that left me with a humdrum feeling inside.

However, that is my only issue with this movie. I will say that I think Toy Story does villians with near perfection and Gabi Gabi is no exception and it probably my favourite character in this. I feel like there was enough in this movie to show that Toy Story is done with this group of toys and maybe it's time to move on to other parts of the world.","displayName":"Michael P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/688747478/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-20T14:54:55.356Z","updateDate":"2019-11-20T14:54:56.915Z","user":{"userId":"792097870","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michael P","accountLink":"/user/id/792097870"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"An excellent movie for all ages with solid story, character development and humor for all ages.
