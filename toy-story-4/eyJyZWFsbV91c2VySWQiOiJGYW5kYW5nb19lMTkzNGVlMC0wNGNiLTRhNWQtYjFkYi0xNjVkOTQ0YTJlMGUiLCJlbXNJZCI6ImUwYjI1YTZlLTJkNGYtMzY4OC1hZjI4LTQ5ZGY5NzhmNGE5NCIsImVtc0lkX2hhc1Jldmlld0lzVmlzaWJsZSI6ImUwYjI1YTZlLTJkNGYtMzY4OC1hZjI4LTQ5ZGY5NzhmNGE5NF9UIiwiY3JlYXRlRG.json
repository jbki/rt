Except this one.  The 'girl power' theme Disney/Pixar has been shoving down our throats (see: Cars 4, or better yet, don't) is nothing short of shameless.  This really was disappointing from the very start. Bo Peep's character was ruined, the ending was terrible, and the rest of the movie was unfunny and unimaginative.  In addition, most of the other characters are barely ever shown and the whole thing revolves around Bonnie (annoying), Forky, and Woody and this new jaded version of Bo Peep.  Boring and a waste of money.  They should have left it alone at the third one.","displayName":"Bob S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-18T03:41:51.392Z","updateDate":"2019-07-18T03:41:51.392Z","user":{"userId":"976451878","realm":"RT","displayName":"Bob S","accountLink":"/user/id/976451878"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Not as many funny adult one liners as in the past","displayName":"Jill G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-18T03:34:32.048Z","updateDate":"2019-07-18T03:34:32.048Z","user":{"userId":"171816fe-60f1-4f10-96ad-69c98bd0ab0a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jill G","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"this movie was great","displayName":"Kennedy N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-18T03:27:28.339Z","updateDate":"2019-07-18T03:27:28.339Z","user":{"userId":"978159546","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kennedy N","accountLink":"/user/id/978159546"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 18, 2019"}]}
