The Benson dolls were very creepy to the point that they could cause nightmares to younger audiences.  I don't want to give away too much of the movie, but I found it disturbing what the Gaby Gaby doll ends up taking from Woody  to make her \"whole\". The ending was a little predictable, but it is, after all, a kids movie.  I like kids movies for happy, satisfying endings.  I did not feel this had that.  On the other hand, I have some nephews who loved it, so this is an adults point of view.","displayName":"Bestsontheroad","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-08T05:04:16.878Z","updateDate":"2019-07-08T05:04:16.878Z","user":{"userId":"e46390e6-a719-4f30-81be-49d0e46f5082","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Bestsontheroad","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Very cute show.

For a guy like me, who was maybe 8 when the first TS released, and now getting to take my kids at nearly the same age, to see the final, it was an experience I'll never forget, and definitely makes this one of my favorite animated movies ever. My daughters are 4 and 5 and sat there hooked. The adult humor kept us laughing as well. The story was superb. I highly recommend seeing this film.","displayName":"IG:OhioBackpackdad","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-08T04:50:03.597Z","updateDate":"2019-07-08T04:50:03.597Z","user":{"userId":"9c8338b2-54ae-44d5-a343-87c32332bbd0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"IG:OhioBackpackdad","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I liked Bonnie and forky the most","displayName":"Rola K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-08T04:44:50.875Z","updateDate":"2019-07-08T04:44:50.875Z","user":{"userId":"b91d3774-ceb2-4e5d-bf6f-a4412f30a94b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rola K","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Loved the consistency of the main characters.
