Some characters were only used for fan service, which is fine, but some were underutilized. For me, this movie is not as memorable as the rest of the movies, but the message overall is important as well. The animation is beautiful and solid performances all around.","displayName":"Deklan R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-21T15:11:31.203Z","updateDate":"2019-12-21T15:11:33.255Z","user":{"userId":"978459109","realm":"RT","displayName":"Deklan R","accountLink":"/user/id/978459109"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Toy Story 4 is the perfect ending to the Toy Story Franchise!!!!!","displayName":"Cohen F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T22:01:23.095Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T22:01:26.012Z","user":{"userId":"978435866","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cohen F","accountLink":"/user/id/978435866"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This movie needed to justify why there are now 4 of them, and I think it pulled it off.","displayName":"Kevin S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-20T21:42:41.160Z","updateDate":"2019-12-20T21:42:44.640Z","user":{"userId":"977880733","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kevin S","accountLink":"/user/id/977880733"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I fell asleep in this one.
