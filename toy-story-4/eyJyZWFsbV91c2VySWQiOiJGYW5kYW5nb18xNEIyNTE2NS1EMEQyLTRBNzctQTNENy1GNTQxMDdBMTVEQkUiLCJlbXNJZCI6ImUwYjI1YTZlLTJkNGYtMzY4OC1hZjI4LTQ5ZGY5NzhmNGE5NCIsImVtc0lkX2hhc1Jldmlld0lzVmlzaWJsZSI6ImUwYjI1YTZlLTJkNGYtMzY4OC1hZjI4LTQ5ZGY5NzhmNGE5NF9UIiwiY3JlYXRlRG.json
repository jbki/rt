I am a huge fan of the series, but this movie just doesn't carry the emotional connection that the other movies had on auidences. There was also so much going on that it made the movie feel it was all over the place. The animation was beautiful though. But I still have no clue why they added this part when 3 was such a beautiful ending to the series.
