Woody was always all about the kid, and it didn't seem he would ever abandon his kid for his self-interest. Plus, this movie was so heavily Woody and BoPeep that I missed the other characters.","displayName":"Matthew L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-09T12:01:22.591Z","updateDate":"2019-07-09T12:01:22.591Z","user":{"userId":"6b025906-f7d5-482d-a65a-9492640c7ad8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Matthew L","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What a fun time!
