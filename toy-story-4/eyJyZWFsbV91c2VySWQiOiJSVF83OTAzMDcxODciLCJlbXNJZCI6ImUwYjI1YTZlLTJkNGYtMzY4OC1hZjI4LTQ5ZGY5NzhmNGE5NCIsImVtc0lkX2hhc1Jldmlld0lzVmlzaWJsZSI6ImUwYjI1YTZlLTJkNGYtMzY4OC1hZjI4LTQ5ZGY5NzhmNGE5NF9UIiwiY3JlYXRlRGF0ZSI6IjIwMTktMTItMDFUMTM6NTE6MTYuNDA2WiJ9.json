Bo peep suddenly changed to a different texture. Buzz had hardly any lines. And almost non of the beloved characters were at the forefront of the film. \nAlso as a children's (and children at heart's  film) I found the movie to be a bit off-putting for small children. Between the creepy menacing marionettes and the creepy extra cut scene at the end with the giant attacking laser eyed stuff animals attacking people, I didn't feel comfortable with my three year old watching. For that matter my Toy Story obsessed toddler didn't find any interest in the film. \nBuzz seemed to revert back to OG Buzz who knew nothing about being a toy despite the fact that he's been a toy for more than 6 years. \n\nIn my opinion it was a sad but unsatisfying end to the 4 part movie series. \nI'm marking this down as a fail. \nKeep the Toy Story magic alive and skip the very last installment of the series.","displayName":"Kinsie R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100006705095341/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T06:26:15.493Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T06:28:09.651Z","user":{"userId":"969006395","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kinsie R","accountLink":"/user/id/969006395"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It's worth watching it.

I really liked this, the animation was just out of this WORLD! Then why did I put this movie at \"only\" 4 stars?! Because of two things, first, Bo peep became kind of trash, she should have stayed the same, now she was less nice and seemed more superficial the other thing is because Bo peep was so focused of just being a free toy, it made Woody go away from Buzz and Jessie! That made me so sad, after all these beautiful years, it just ended there.
