He and I both loved it. The story was moving and full of messages. I appreciated the humor - I could hear the adults loving the same scenes as I did. The messages - good vs evil, friendship, promises kept, loving relationships, bravery, strong female character ... I found them all in this memorable movie.","displayName":"Sarah W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-09T02:21:56.892Z","updateDate":"2019-07-09T02:21:56.892Z","user":{"userId":"85b9c75e-063e-499a-9e5a-25a438dac26b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Sarah W","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a cute movie.
