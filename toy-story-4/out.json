It felt extremely out of character, instead of something to be worked towards for the whole series of movies, it felt like an impromptu decision made by Woody.

{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"There's no doubt that the animation has improved significantly from the first film 24 years ago. The attention to detail in the film is incredible and it is such a visually beautiful film. However, I do think that the storyline is much slower than the first 3 films, with not much happening until Woody discovers the antique shop halfway through the film. Objectively, the movie was amazing on its own but in regards to the previous 3, it just doesn't stand up. It's fun to watch and I'd recommend it but it really disappointed me as a Toy Story lover since the 3rd film \"ended\" the storyline perfectly, in my opinion. Nonetheless, it was well made, funny, and heartwarming.","displayName":"Sarah C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-13T13:07:18.029Z","updateDate":"2019-07-13T13:07:18.029Z","user":{"userId":"978152952","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sarah C","accountLink":"/user/id/978152952"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 13, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Popcorn Empire - Toy Story 4 Review: “... Toy Story 4 is a near perfect entry in one of the strongest animated franchises of all time” 9/10 Toy Story is a series of Pixar animated films that have been entertaining audiences of all ages for over 20 years. These films have consistently been on the cutting edge of animation, full of charming characters and fun stories. With each film, the stories have become more and more emotional, dealing with the existential crisis of toys and their purpose. Pushing these themes further than ever, Toy Story 4 is a near perfect entry in one of the strongest animated franchises of all time. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! In this film, the story more heavily revolves around Woody than in previous entries. He still struggles to move on from Andy, and because of this he projects his loyalty onto Bonnie. When Bonnie makes Forky during her preschool orientation, Woody immediately notices how much Forky means to her. He becomes determined to a fault to keep Bonnie and Forky together. Things become complicated when Forky tries to run away during a family road trip, and Woody chases after him. When Woody gets sidetracked looking for Bo Peep, who was separated from the group years before, the rest of the gang begin to look for him and Forky. What follows is zippy adventure with fun action sequences, lots of laughs, and most importantly, a lot of heart. Many new toy characters are introduced, all of which are funny and entertaining. It’s very hard not to smile just from the sheer amount of charm in the entire cast of characters, both old and new. The humor is as goofy and hilarious as ever, especially with the new character Forky, voiced by Tony Hale. His existential nightmare causes all sorts of antics, and his childlike worldview is endearing and unique. One minor drawback is that we don’t get a lot of screen time with some classic characters such as Rex, Slinky, and Jessie. A large number of toys are left to sit in an RV for most of the movie, while Buzz and Woody run around with new characters. But this is a minor complaint when what we do get is so much fun. While the plot does rehash some ideas from previous films, what makes this story work so well is its strong emotional core. Woody learns to let go of the past, accept that his life as a child’s toy is over, and begin to pursue the life he really wants. The voice performances are top notch all around, giving this movie a lot of personality and charm. The animation is vibrant, detailed, and beautifully rendered. Overall, this is a top-of-the-line animated film, and it delivers just about everything you could want from a Toy Story sequel. 9/10","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-06T22:39:01.582Z","updateDate":"2019-07-06T22:39:01.582Z","user":{"userId":"260299650","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260299650"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 06, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Watching Toy Story on VHS when I was a kid at elementary school was the best thing that had ever happened to me. But to have to watch the biggest, best blockbuster of the summer, Toy Story 4, is just the most wonderful thing, especially when watched twice in two weeks of June. To simply put it, Toy Story 4 has all the most wonderful equivalents of Cars 3. One reason is because it teaches about friendship and inclusion and how to love each toy the way he (and she) is. And two, among the three \"Toy Stories\" I've watched in the past, this one this year is the most superb, because it is reminiscent of all of them. Makes me want to relive the day I received my first toy as a little kid years ago. The lesson: sometimes it's great to remember all of the good times you had as a kid being in elementary school, other times we look forward to the present (and future).

It's simply beautiful and must not be missed. I can't think of a better conclusion to Woody's story arc, which is deeply moving. It's funny yet scary, childlike yet philosophical, light yet deep -- all at the same time. You can't help but emphathize with the existential crisis of a toy - one day beloved, next day trash and start questioning your purpose of life! Brilliantly told and executed, thanks also to having a great cast of voice actors, including Tom Hanks. Seriously, WOW! Please, Disney. Start working on Toy Story 5.

{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The third Toy Story felt like the perfect send-off to the characters and franchise, however, with this new film, it feels more like an epilogue.\n\nI enjoyed most of the film, the animation is breathtaking, almost feels real at many moments. The soundtrack by the talented Randy Newman call backs to the first two Toy Story movies, which brought back great memories of those films. \n\nThe voice acting of the main cast like Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts, and Joan Cusack still sound as talented as they were in 1995. The voices brought in for the new characters like Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), Forky (Tony Hale), and Duke Kaboom (Keanu Reeves) are welcome additions.\n\nThe story is easy to follow, but dramatic and somewhat deep at moments, especially to those who grew up with the franchise. Woody notices that Bonnie is unhappy, in which he helps create the arts and crafts toy, Forky. Forky tries to declare himself as trash, however, and it is up to Woody to show him his place as a toy. They then go on a road trip with Bonnie with the rest of the gang, and Woody unexpectedly reunites with Bo Peep again. This, along with other problems Woody and the other toys face over the course of the film create some great tension.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I feel this film should be seen as more of an epilogue or extension to the events of the third film, as it focuses more on Woody, Bo, and the new characters rather than the toys we know. That doesn't mean they don't get their chance to shine in this film though. Buzz still remains as the loyal friend of Woody, and so does Jessie, but their roles seem to be pushed aside a bit, which is my only issue with the film.\n\nThis still is a great conclusion to one of Pixar's greatest series of films, and also showcases the talent that this studio still has after all these years.","displayName":"Drew M.

{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"amazing entry to the franchise, however, as Matthew Rozsa put it perfectly, it's the bleakest but most beautifulest in all ways. Its design and graphic animation is superb and stuns the other movies. Character development is great and the villain is one of the best structured villains i've seen to date. But Buzz is completely played of and shoe horned to the side quite abruptly and dumbed down for comic relief. It also hangs shy from a 5 star not only because of that but because it really does play with the 'is this necessary?' emotions of a sequel. It's a good add on yes. But i do venture to the side of it should ending with the beautiful Andy Saga ending.

With a strong plot, a powerful ending that breaks hearts, a delightful voice cast and a ton of Pixar Easter eggs and references, this was a very enyojable time.","displayName":"Johann M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10206416292986888/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-23T21:28:05.996Z","updateDate":"2019-07-23T21:28:05.996Z","user":{"userId":"822101374","realm":"RT","displayName":"Johann M","accountLink":"/user/id/822101374"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 23, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Toy Story 4 is a fond farewell to over 20 years of adventures with Woody and Buzz, with great new characters and even better voice acting.\n\nThe film picks up from Toy Story 3 as we find Woody feeling neglected by his new owner, Bonnie. Woody is trying to reconnect with Bonnie so he follows her to kindergarten and helps her forge a new toy named Forky. Forky wants to return to being trash, but Bonnie adores him so it won't happen on Woody's lovewatch. During Bonnie's family road trip, Forky escapes and Woody goes after him. In pursuit of Forky, he runs into old friend Bo Peep at a carnival. She has lived happily as a lost toy and offers him a new way of seeing the world. Woody questions what he wants as a toy and whether to stay with Bonnie or live with Bo. A whole new set of adventures and new friends await to point the way to Woody in this charming last installment of a long-cherished tale of toys and the children they love. \n\nThis may be Woody's story, but Forky steals the show. Tony Hale is endearingly wacky and weird and provides a surprising amount of the film's heart. Keegan Michael Key and Jordan Peele are really well-cast as Ducky and Bunny. I can't imagine a better comedic duo bringing this pair of bickering carnival prizes to life. Key and Peele are Toy Story 4's secret weapon and the film picks up every time they're cracking jokes together. Keanu Reeves is larger than life as the small but mighty Duke Caboom, who declares himself Canada's greatest stuntman. Reeves adds a self assured confidence and lively energy that makes this character soar.\n\nToy Story 4 has an equally humorous and emotionally meaningful screenplay. The rapid fire pace of the jokes is balanced well with the film's bittersweet moments. We've been following Woody from the very beginning of these films and Toy Story 4 gives his arc a fitting end, while also diving deep into who he is. My only quibble with the screenplay is that, with all these new characters given so much time to shine, I miss having more time with beloved characters from earlier chapters. There's something so moving about the bond between child and toy in the way it's portrayed in this film. Forky is not your typical plaything, but what matters is the joy he brings Bonnie and the lasting impact he'll have on her life, the lasting impact all of these toys will.\n\nI recommend Toy Story 4 for ages 5 to 18. There are doll characters that Woody and Forky meet that are somewhat creepy when introduced. These movies resonate with children who grew up with Woody and the gang and now their children can enjoy these films. If you're a Toy Story fan, you're going to adore this film. Toy Story 4 is a thoroughly entertaining, wholesome adventure and a nice way to cap off this franchise and I give it 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nReviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Toy Story 4 starts out well with a great premise, Woody is going to recover a Toy named Forky that Bonnie created using her own imagination. The ideas that were worth exploring with Forky were boundless-what is the meaning of being a toy? Toy Story 4 explores this idea for a little while and then fully abandons it halfway through the movie. It turns into the usual Toy Story plotlines. Forky is barely a part of the finale. Buzz is forced into the storyline when he really doesn't serve any purpose whatsoever (he is really forced in there to introduce two side characters and get a key, which is really something unnecessary for the story to happen). Pixar delivers a good film, which I consider Pixar's version of phoning it in.

{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Completely underwhelmed. I took my 4 yr old, who loves the first three, and he asked to leave halfway through. This hardly felt like a kids movie, despite the rating. The only jokes I laughed at were the ones aimed at adults. Most of the movie took place in an antique shop with creepy dolls, not something that kids will find interesting. They went for emotional impact, but it was recycled from previous movies & added nothing new to the franchise. The other movies had humor and child-friendly action sequences to keep kids entertained in between the emotional scenes, but this one completely missed out. Very little screen time for most of the old characters, some of the characters actually regressed (Buzz, even Woody), new characters were boring/recycled from previous films, and we had no resolution for the initial dilemma (Bonnie scared of Kindergarten). I know the point was Woody letting go, rather than about Bonnie, but it still felt completely against Woody's character to straight up leave his friends and his Kid to live a life on the road. I'm shocked the movie was reviewed so well...I'm usually in agreement with the rottentomatoes consensus, but I can't help but feel let down by this one. Even if the plot & character development was weak, I was at least hoping for an entertaining movie for my 4 yr old. Failed in all categories, except the animation was spectacular like always.","displayName":"Denise J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-05T21:43:28.235Z","updateDate":"2019-07-05T21:46:18.337Z","user":{"userId":"978142060","realm":"RT","displayName":"Denise J","accountLink":"/user/id/978142060"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 05, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It's a law of Hollywood that sooner or later, every franchise hits diminishing returns. It's even truer with kid's movies, which typically run out of new ideas at a disheartening rate. But leave it to Pixar to buck that trend and exceed every expectation. After four movies and twenty four years, Toy story is still fresh as ever, with all the wonder and imagination of the original, coupled with hilarious new characters and compelling new themes.\n\nIf you've seen any of the trailers or posters, then you know Forky, the misshapen, neurotic new toy cobbled together from a spork and a pipe cleaner. This little fellow may be one of Pixar's best ideas in years. He's a hilariously mixed up, frightened little bundle of nerves who thinks he's literally trash. And who keeps throwing himself into the trash with a single-minded determination that only gets funnier with each of the seemingly endless repetitions.\n\nIf you think about it, this may be the first time an essentially suicidal character has been used as a running gag in a kid's movie. This will of course go completely over kids' heads. But for the rest of us, once you get past the morbidity, it's actually kind of heartwarming the lengths that Woody goes to keep Forky where he belongs. Like a veteran crisis councilor, he simply will not give up on the little guy until he realizes that he has a purpose and someone who loves him. If you think about it some more, this could honestly be used a part of a suicide prevention PSA\n\nAlthough Keanu Reeves' screentime as Canadian motorcycle daredevil Duke Kaboom is briefer than the ads might suggest, it's no less awesome or outrageous. And Key and Peel are outstanding as a pair of sassy, street smart fair-prize plushies. Seriously, these guys are little psychopaths. And the new villains are seriously creep-tastic. Like cymbal clanging monkey or Bette Davis level creepy, with deeply disturbing intentions towards our heroes. Which makes the directions the movie ultimately takes them all the more amazing.\n\nI especially loved the new Bo Peep. Not only is her role here far bigger than in past films, but's she's practically a whole new toy. Years of living on her own and caring for other cast-off toys have turned her into a formidably leader and fighter who doesn't need anyone's help, thank you very much. But for the gruff exterior and awesome kung-fu moves, she hasn't forgotten what it means to make a kid smile. This is the kind of feminist role model our kids can use.\n\n\nEach of the past entries, in their own way, dealt with the fear of abandonment, whether by being replaced, wearing out, or simply becoming irrelevant as others move on. Toy Story 3 completed that arc, and brought Woody and Andy's relationship full circle. Which is why many, myself included, were surprised and even a bit wary when yet another installment was announced. It just didn't seem like there was a point in stretching out the franchise. But of course, Pixar found a way.\n\nMoving beyond the themes of the earlier films, this installment is at heart about destiny, purpose, accepting when it's time to move on and start something new. All of these are handled with a degree of subtlety and depth which far surpasses your average kid's movie, but is exactly what we would expect from this studio. Toy Story 3 seemed like the end, and it would have made a perfectly good one. But this feels like the real closure, and the beginning of Woody's happily ever after, even as it hints at the possibility of more adventures to come. This may or may not be the end. But either way, it's another triumph for Pixar, and easily the best kid's movie of the summer.\n","displayName":"William S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T03:58:02.681Z","updateDate":"2019-07-07T04:10:47.630Z","user":{"userId":"905173010","realm":"RT","displayName":"William S","accountLink":"/user/id/905173010"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"},

That said, it is still a very funny film, but they still should have probably stopped at Toy Story 3.","displayName":"Paul C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-26T14:28:03.446Z","updateDate":"2019-07-26T14:28:03.446Z","user":{"userId":"810528202","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paul C","accountLink":"/user/id/810528202"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 26, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Now, I'll talk about the movie in detail, but just the relationship part ;). First of all, I think Woody and Bo Peep's relationship started VERY late. The end of the movie, are you serious??? And to go on with that, it wasn't clear they were leaving together immediately until all the other toys left. Now, the real part is the amount of times they hugged. Like, I get that it's rated G and all, but why would you put us through the pain of watching them embrace instead of actually letting them kiss. If I'm being honest, I was disappointed with the extent that Disney/Pixar took the relationship too. Some may argue that this is because of the movie rating, but I know PLENTY of kindergartners, who had the first kiss. And I'm not talking about with their mom, I'm talking about with their Uncle ;). I'm just kidding, but for real, one small smooch from Bo on Woody's cheek couldn't of hurt, right? The second to last thing I have to say is about Forky and \"Knifia??\" (bear with me)'s relationship. It started at the VERY VERY end of movie. And I know, maybe you don't want to see two utensils making out, but seriously, the depth of the relationship was not thought about enough. And my theory for this is probably because the animators and directors and story writers probably work so many hours at Pixar/Disney that they don't have the time for relationships. But watch some erotica, will ya? Finally, I'd like to complain about the RUNPEE app. It told me that there was an extra after waiting for the 6 minute credits. You know what that extra was? The Pixar Intro with Duke Caboom bouncing on the I in pixar and then one tiny character walking in. Then it ended. I really expected more from this app which had such high reviews. If you're going to talk about the after-credits, make it reliable and true. But I'm not going to write a review on the app store because I know how hard that developer works. Anyway, thanks for sticking to my rant.. and I hoped this helped if your hopes were to see some erotic action in the possible conclusion to this animated saga.\n\n -Master Reviewer","displayName":"Master R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T23:11:26.538Z","updateDate":"2019-07-07T23:11:37.415Z","user":{"userId":"978145334","realm":"RT","displayName":"Master R","accountLink":"/user/id/978145334"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"There was absolutely no need for Toy Story 4.. Although the plot was nice and overall it was a decent movie on its own, it absolutely does not match the legacy of the previous three movies. They completely abandoned the main aspect of the film and Woody's personality and traits. The ending was disappointing, the brief and not at all sentimental goodbye between Buzz and Woody made me so sad that I wished I could've never seen it and keep the ending of Toy Story 3 in my mind. Toy Story was always about friendship and loyalty, not about love, yet they made it about love and abandoning everything Woody stood for, for a so called \"love\". Andy gave his favorite toy to Bonnie for her to forget him and mistreat him? Sorry, but no.

The toys joke is relatable to both child and adult alike, while the dramatic moment is uniquely touching because the characters are toys (just imagine the last hugging moments and replace them with humans.

From the first toy story the sub-theme of toys as children's plaything, evolved into collector item in ts2, become hands-me-down in ts3, and in ts4 we got toys that was made by the children.

{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't. I think if it was something I hadn't grown up with and had Pixar not hyped it up and made it, I would have liked it more. But there just wasn't enough EMOTION. (Franchise spoilers) The first Toy Story, there was that moment when Woody told Buzz he was jealous of him and felt it should have been him strapped to a rocket. The second one had the sadness of Jessie's abandonment. The third one...oh the third one made me cry. But this one? There wasn't enough to make me FEEL. Buzz has a pretty idiotic side plot, Jessie and Andy's original toys are almost never on screen, and Woody and Bo just didn't build it up enough. I kept sitting in the theater and waiting to feel like I was experiencing this film, waiting for Pixar to hit me in the heart, and it didn't happen. Towards the end there was a part where I think I was supposed to cry and I just didn't. It wasn't built up enough. The third one was much better. This is the weakest one in the franchise. Not a horrible movie, but just not up to the standard these movies and Pixar have set.","displayName":"Fantasy F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-10T20:07:39.202Z","updateDate":"2019-09-29T04:02:11.069Z","user":{"userId":"965827173","realm":"RT","displayName":"Fantasy F","accountLink":"/user/id/965827173"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 10, 2019"},

It creates a similar relationship that Woody had with Buzz who thought he was a real Space Ranger, BUT with a twist regarding Fork-y's sense of self awareness and purpose.  Same with the villain too, seemed like any of the previous Toy Story villains but with a new twist.  Something to think about, this movie features the least of the original core characters, it's like part 3 was THEIR last adventure.

This movie is a little overated, with this i ´m not saying that the movie is bad, i just say that toy story 4 has a 97/100 in rotten tomatoes, or has a 8.2/10 in imdb, the movie is good yeah but it's not good enough to have those qualifications, let's be,honest of the 4 movies this is the worst, the only that stands out from its predecessors is in the incredible animation, something thati like very much is that the movie takes risk and lets Woody leave once it have finished his purpose, and his ending is good, great ending, I hope that this one be the last movie, in conclusion toy story 4 is a good movie with a mature plot,but nothing outstanding.","displayName":"Diego P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-07T06:50:41.409Z","updateDate":"2019-08-07T06:54:03.253Z","user":{"userId":"978187911","realm":"RT","displayName":"Diego P","accountLink":"/user/id/978187911"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 07, 2019"},

Yes its a 4th part to a great movie which by now fans usually will get tired of seeing a new part that is lackluster or made just for profit but this final installment was as good as the first or even better.

{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Just like anyone else, I was very skeptical when I hear they were making a fourth Toy Story film. However, they did an amazing job. The story was something new, and an interesting concept. However, they did not give a lot of the other characters like Buzz and Jessie a lot of screentime but made up for it with all of its new characters. The villain, Gabby Gabby was very cool. I also loved Jordan Peele and Keegan Michael-Key's characters, Bunny and Ducky, I also think they did a great job. Keanu Reeves was also an amazing addition to the franchise. However, I do believe that the original Toy Story is better, but this is definitely my second favorite one, it was a close call.

{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"This was a movie I was extremely skeptical of considering how well Toy Story 3 ended. The Toy Story saga is arguably Pixar’s crowning achievement in terms of an established animated franchise, and the trilogy ended perfectly. So when a 4th was announced, I was worried it might tarnish the reputation of the trilogy that came before it. What Pixar produced was another classic and possibly the most rewatch-able Toy Story movie to date. After ending Andy’s storyline and opening up this movie it has become evident that all the individual characters still have a story to tell. This movie services as that extra layer of icing on an already delicious cake. There is not nearly the same amount of story to tell as in each of the previous 3 films however. The plot of Toy Story 4 is very simple and straightforward, yet it still works in its own way. The reason it works so well is because it owns its simple story and fills the gaps with some of the funniest moments I can remember in an animated movie, as well as great character moments. The focus here is on Woody, completely closing his wonderful character arc in the best way possible. This is a movie that boasts a dynamic script and character development as opposed to an epic journey, and it’s all the better for it. The choice to do this results in a Toy Story movie that feels unique compared to the others, and is simply the result of a team of people that know exactly what they are doing and how to do it. This film was confidently crafted and achieved exactly what it wanted to and then some. Toy Story 4 concludes the franchise with a bang while standing out from the crowd. It even makes a solid case for being the best Toy Story film to date, but that would be dependent upon what the viewer loves most about these animated movies.

{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"This movie explores the insecurities of woody, going completely against his normal enthusiastic leadership. Woody worked hard over the past 3 movies bringing toys together under the idea that a toy needs to be there for its children. Woody abandons all of this, and his friends to be a lost toy which not only doesnt work innthe movie, it goes against everything woody has stood for. The other toys are just oknwith him abandoning hom to it just didnt work. The new characters ranged from boring to uninteresting.  Forky was not a good character he was the center of the story but wasnt worth the time. The only humorous toy this time was duke kaboom but his antics will look familiar because youve seen them before. Hes a direct rip off of the fun from the lego movies. None of this story should have happened.  It was terrible.  The movie lacked humor, fun, its missing a good story and new characters you can be drawn too. All in all they change everything about what woody stood for and throw away the driving principle of the past 3 movies. They should have thrown this script in the trash with forky and left them their it sucked.","displayName":"Jonathon L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-13T21:50:38.480Z","updateDate":"2019-07-13T21:50:57.492Z","user":{"userId":"975303286","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonathon L","accountLink":"/user/id/975303286"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 13, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Toy Story 4 transforms the original Trilogy by expanding the ideas from previous films while giving another ending to the franchise. I thought 3 was the perfect ending, but now this film justifies its own existence by creating a dichotomy of expanding its own view of a toy's purpose of existence versus the toy's freedom to determine its own future. This film would make a great jumping off point for existential and teleological discussions.\nMy only gripe is that it somehow manages to feel smaller than previous Toy Story films in terms of narrative. It feels like a great epilogue, but I fear if they decide to make a fifth entry, this issue will become more glaring.","displayName":"Ryan  M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-08T19:37:08.039Z","updateDate":"2019-07-08T19:37:08.039Z","user":{"userId":"978146629","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan  M","accountLink":"/user/id/978146629"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 08, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"No Kidding, This is One Great Toy\n\nIt boggles the mind the way the TS films are so uniformly excellent and diverse. I was not expecting greatness again - and surprise ! It was fabulous, gorgeous, witty, moving and unpredictable.\n\nPixar keeps improving their skills. The writing, helmed by Andrew Stanton, is excellent and the actors - especially Hanks (who owns this one completely ) have never been better. I can't believe what I'm saying, but I love these 'cartoons'. They are better than regular movies. TS3 was my favourite film of its year of release and it will take a hell of a movie to better this. Please read all of the critic reviews and audience reviews if you like. I can't say which one is my favourite, but this is right up there with the best.\n\nA lot of hate for Disney these days, but just think....Marvel. Star Wars. Pixar. Lion King. Aladdin. I mean, it's ridiculous the way Disney has cornered popular entertainment without dropping quality. If anyone can remember anyone else doing this before, I am happy to hear about it.","displayName":"Richard B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1150902893/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-07-22T16:14:23.059Z","updateDate":"2019-07-22T16:14:23.059Z","user":{"userId":"953525032","realm":"RT","displayName":"Richard B","accountLink":"/user/id/953525032"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 22, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Toy Story 4 is a feminist rom/com—a romantic comedy in the classic mold with a feminist twist.\n\nIndeed, the film \"makes the couple\" a whopping 3 times: Woody (the reluctant male who needs to be persuaded to take the plunge) and Bo Peep; Forky and (for a better word) Knifey, the \"trash\" twosome whose coming together as the credits roll is both unexpected and delightful, a moment of sheer cinematic bliss; and Gabby Gabby and the \"lost girl.\"\n\nEven though Woody is the primary protagonist, and several new male toys are introduced, \"Toy Story 4\" goes beyond the addition of a female toy here and there (e.g. cowgirl Jessie in \"Toy Story 2\"); this is the franchise's feminist film. \n\nWoody is fond of Bo Beep and she of him. But Bo's strengths are many and threaten to overwhelm and displace Woody's desire. She's a fiercely independent feminist, having been \"on her own,\" beyond the security of a child's bedroom, for 7 years. She's an athlete and a warrior, using her hook as a both a weapon and climbing device. Bo and other independent toys travel around in a mechanical skunk. These \"Independent Toys,\" which exist somewhere between \"Lost Toys\" and \"Toys who have a Kid,\" are a new category for the franchise.\n\nDuke Caboom, Ducky and Bunny are solid and funny additions to the \"Toy Story\" crew, but on the whole the cast is too large and dispenses with too many familiar characters to achieve the kind of focus that shaped previous editions.\n\nThese caveats aside, \"Toy Story 4\" is almost as good as its predecessors - and that's saying something.","displayName":"Dianne B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-22T15:49:57.067Z","updateDate":"2019-07-22T15:49:57.067Z","user":{"userId":"977942067","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dianne B","accountLink":"/user/id/977942067"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 22, 2019"},

It won't pull at your heartstrings like Toy Story 3, but it will make you tear up a bit more often when compared to its predecessor.

{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Knifey: \"How am I alive?\"\n\nForky: \"I don't know.\"\n\n‘Toy Story 4' is a lighthearted adventure that neatly wraps up the perfect character arc, which is light years better than the third, in my opinion. However, in spite of that, I'm still questing why this fourth entry exist, because everything else is paper thin.\n\nLets start off with the merits: I know saying the animation is amazing isn't anything new when it comes to Pixar - a company that's constantly involving with every entry. It's the same with as saying \"Meryl Streep is great in...\", type of situation but needs addressing ever time. I liked how beautifully polished every character and environment looked, which gave the movie a certain quality in richness. There's a scene at the beginning involving rain that's close to photo-realism and a clear growth in the animation department. I mean, the difference based on the plastic looking models back in 1995.\n\nPerhaps my favorite character in the entire movie was Duke Caboom played by the breathtaking Keanu Reeves. Despite the little screen, Reeves manages to bring some much charisma and enjoyment to the character it was hard for me not to smile. I was surprised that a few people didn't realise it was Keanu, but then again he's casting wasn't anything secretive if you're like me that follows announcements on upcoming movies. Anywhere, I could tell Keanu was having a blast with this role and it seems very fitting considering Reeves stunt work.\n\nI was shocked, yet glad that the character of Forky wasn't as disposable as I originally thought. Surprisingly the main message of purpose and suicide came from Forky's dilemma...no joke, well that's how I interpret it. It's something you don't pick up on, but you're brain did.\n\nThe funniest aspect of the movie came from Bunny and Ducky played by Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key, especially the plan scene where the visual comedy was used effectively for laughs. I thought they were going to be so annoying based on the trailers, but I was relieved that they had some good material for the jokes and punchlines to be funny.\n\nIt's great to see the old gang back together with some welcoming new faces. Although I feel like the old gang got pushed to side characters this time around. Even Buzz didn't seem to be himself and got backtracked to do absolutely nothing through out the movie. I know there's a lot of characters and it be difficult to juggle so any, but if we've learned anything from ‘Infinity War' is that it may seem impossible until it's done.\n\nI'll give the movie credit for not having any villains, as it would've been unneeded and a cheap trick to add dramatic tension.\n\nHowever, despite the welcoming return and facing new conflict, but everything else has less to desire. I wasn't quite emotionally involved as I should've been, yet at the end, I didn't hit me as the movie intended. If I have to be honest, after seeing this a few weeks ago, I'm struggling to remember certain scenes. This movie existing is unnecessary as everything felt made up on the spot which I think is the reason why it didn't emotionally connect with me like the previous three did.\n\nA big step down for the franchise, but family and children will enjoy it no matter what, and that ain't a bad thing.\n\nOverall rating: \"I'm trash\"","displayName":"Matthew L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000196775387/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-18T22:59:16.283Z","updateDate":"2019-07-18T22:59:16.283Z","user":{"userId":"931412053","realm":"RT","displayName":"Matthew L","accountLink":"/user/id/931412053"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 18, 2019"},

The character Forky supports the idea that not only toys come to life. The setting was perfect for colorful shots.

Overall, Toy Story 4 is another funny, emotional, and memorable Pixar story that will be forever remembered. The Toy Story franchise wouldn't be the same without Toy Story 4.

{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Firstly I'd like to say what contributed to my ultimate decision to see this movie, besides blinding nostalgia.\n\nA couple came into my work the day before and I noticed their son, maybe 3 years old, was holding a Toy Story coloring book. I told him it was very cool, and apparently they'd just finished watching it. The couple asked him to tell me who his favorite character was and he proceeded to yell \"FORKY, FORKY\". I told him I really wanna see it, and later as they were leaving the boy looked back and yelled \"GO SEE TOYS, GO SEE FORKY\". And so, I felt somewhat obligated!\n\nForky was definitely a stand out, his introduction was hilarious and his quirks as a \"newborn toy\" are probably the funniest bits in the movie. Followed closely by Key & Peele as Bunny & Ducky, their natural chemistry lives even in animated form and it was honestly a really refreshing change of pace for Toy Story. Another highlight was Keanu Reeves as Duke Kaboom, \"Canada's Greatest Stuntman\", he's not in the movie as much as I expected him to be but when he was he pretty much stole the scene every time. I would argue this is probably the funniest of all 4 movies, everyone gets a chance to shine and there are some fun running gags.\n\nHowever, the introduction of new characters comes with the sidelining of familiar faces. Rex, Ham, the Potato Heads (with archived lines from the late Don Rickles), Jesse and so on are present and ready, but they're restricted to one liners and emotional support. Even the ones introduced in Toy Story 3 don't have much to do. It's definitely up to Woody, Buzz and Bo Peep carry the load, and carry it they do. Bo Peep, a character meant to be the flirt for Woody in Toy Story 1&2, is now a battle damaged warrior who kicks ass! Her story as a lost toy is one of the most interesting parts and it really surprised me just how much emotional baggage she was given. Unfortunately Buzz doens't have much to do, he has a running gag throughout the movie that got some laughs outta me but what they did to make it work kinda took me out of it sometimes. I guess any sort of character development ended with Toy Story 2. Having said that it was really good to hear Tim Allen back and he hasn't skipped a beat as Buzz Lightyear. The central villain character is a toy named Gabby Gabby, and I was afraid of having another toy villain because every villain after Toy Story 1 has been a toy and they've never been as good as Sid. That's still very much the case, but Gabby Gabby is really the best of the toy villains! She has interesting motivations and you can actually sypathize with her.\n\nBut Toy Story has not at all forgotten who the main character is. Woody remains the core of this series, and somehow 4 movies in and 24 years later he continues to grow as a character. His arc is wisely set up from the very beginning of the movie and the themes related to him are really the driving force. And these themes come with some unexpectedly emotional moments, perhaps even more so Toy Story 3. That's right, get ready to tear up my fellow manchildren.\n\nAnyway, I really liked this movie. Better than I expected and definitely more ambitious than Tory Story 3. And the animation, my god, who sold their soul to make it look that good? I'm almost certain they filmed in actual places for certain parts, it's nuts.\n\nTHANK YOU IF YOU READ THROUGH! 8/10","displayName":"Cody J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1069801948/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-07-06T05:22:38.578Z","updateDate":"2019-07-06T05:22:38.578Z","user":{"userId":"906538361","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cody J","accountLink":"/user/id/906538361"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 06, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Mistake. Most of this movie was a mistake. I am only giving it a half of a star because the animation was sleek and clean. But the plot, oh god the plot was a piece of garbage. It is clearly established over the other three movies that the toy gang is tight. It is the entire PREMISE of these movies in fact. But of course, the lovey dovey romance of Bo Peep and Woody had to ruin it. It was unbelievable. In the first movie, yes, he liked her, and the sexual tension was clear, but there was no way he would jeopardize the relationship of his air tight group and Andy over it. And then, in the second movie, he has some tension with Jesse. This was actually nice, because it helped give Woody a reason to be conflicted over wanting to leave his group, or be put and honored in a museum. But nope. The tension of that movie did not follow through whatsoever. Toy story 3 was the best movie by far, because it had an amazing script that left me crying, and two THERE WAS NO ROMANCE. (I do not count the romance between Jesse and Buzz because it didn't directly influence the plot). But of course, all good things must come to an end. And I was convinced that the ending in Toy Story 3 was the finale, which was a good one to be honest. But of course, the franchise wanted more money. They ended up changing the characters just in the pursuit of more moolah. In Toy Story 4, most of the group, all of the wacky and mischievous characters that complimented each other end up sitting in a van for all of the movie. It was heart wrenching. Not cool, Pixar. And trying to scare all of the young impressionable children in the audience? That was awful! And the characters, Jesus, the characters! There are so many I barely remember their names! I pretty much only remember the gang! They are only used when the plot needs them! Or for shabby comedic effect. Like that whole minute of Lame Canadian where he poses. Overall, this movie was a disappointment. I'm only a freshman in high school. I've grown up on this franchise and I've always been a fan. Until now. Woody would never leave the gang. Never. I'm highly offended that this movie made it past the test viewers. I'm utterly horrified and shocked.\n\nSincerely,\nA disappointed 14 year old fan.

{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Toy Story 4 is an enjoyable film, but for every fun moment it seemed that there was an equally frustrating one. The new characters that were introduced didn't seem forced and brought something new to the franchise, but most of the characters we have come to love were left behind. I would like to have seen Buzz and Jessie play a larger role in the film, but it seems like they were both limited to just a few scenes in favor of Woody and Bo Peep having the max amount of screen time. Even Forky, the central plot point of the film, didn't get enough screen time, so we could see Bo Peep and Woody's relationship be fleshed out on screen. I did love every second of Duck & Bunny's screen time. I laughed every time they were on screen and their characters definitely brought something new to the Toy Story Universe. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but it wasn't what I wanted in a new Toy Story, but I am a 28 year old man looking at the film through nostalgia glasses. I am sure the movie would be greatly appreciated by the target audience.

{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Once again, I feel like everyone on Rotten Tomatoes saw a different movie than I did. This was a huge disappointment. The plot was a mess, there were too many characters and they were mostly flat and just band-aids when the filmmakers couldn't decide what to do next. The first three films of this series were pinnacles of entertainment and resonance. What happened? And why do the critics love this swampy disaster? I'm mystified and felt like I had to inject some truth into this morass of fake love for a faulty product.

{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"\"Toy Store 4\" is the sequel that works, even after three films, even lower than its others, precisely because of the dramatic and sentimental concept, the fourth quarter of the pixar is cold, but with characters hot, but the sensation of filer film is only saved in its final act, which gives a much better charge to what was being sent.\n\nThe script has highs and lows in all respects, the creation of new, and good characters, who work very well, the strengthening and growth of Betty, who creates a strong and powerful Golden, naturally and legitimately without seeming forced, creating a different character, however, the various other great characters of the franchise end up being left behind here, like Jessie Or Mr. Potato. the diminution of the screen time of the character of the buzz lightyear implies in a protagonism, still more evident of the Woody, who is a good personage, and here carries much of the dramatic responsibility. Gaby Gaby is a good character with a very interesting bow, but with a common ending, \"Garfinho\" brings a new symbolism to the franchise and works well, even having a more comical function and serving as the script key.\n\nToy Story has always been remembered for having a spectacular animation, this is its first, and in its fourth version, clearly a new level is achieved, the film has a spectacular animation with light and shadow games, no mechanization, fluid movements and real, in terms of animation and direction, Toy Story 4 is spectacular.\n\nToy Srory 4 has few artifices for the children's audience, one or another joke and the visual issue, the rest is a film that little children will have fun with a load and more adult concept, the film has a message on maturation, attachment, love and of course, friendship. Toy Story 4 only stands above its predecessors in terms of animation, however, it still continues a good movie.","displayName":"ANDERSON G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-10T01:45:32.564Z","updateDate":"2019-07-10T01:45:32.564Z","user":{"userId":"974807001","realm":"RT","displayName":"ANDERSON G","accountLink":"/user/id/974807001"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 10, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Excellent addition to the Toy Story franchise! All our favorites were represented and we even got a nostalgic visit from Andy (via flashback). Loved the plot too! Fitting and fulfilling to see Woody, who has loyally and steadfastly spent the entirety of the last 20 years looking out for his kid and all his friends, finally reach the point in his, er, life where he makes a decision about what is best for him and his happiness! Had to have been at least 4 scenes in the last 20 minutes that could jerk a tear from darn near anyone with a pulse. This felt very final (I know we all felt that way about Toy Story 3 though), but at last in that ending our main characters were all still together so continuing the story with the right idea could work. Now it feels FINAL. I know money carries the day on Hollywood, but I hope the powers that be let the sorry rest now...if so, awesome, Dare I say, perfect finale!","displayName":"Ryan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-15T04:33:22.254Z","updateDate":"2019-07-15T04:33:22.911Z","user":{"userId":"fd649339-a9bc-415f-8159-5a3218b18e34","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ryan","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 15, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Even after three previous movies, spanning 20 years, the \"magic\" is still there! The voices, plot, direction, and execution were great. A lot of the trademark humor as well. My only VERY small complaint is that it felt somewhat like a continuation of the previous film. I would have liked to have seen a completely original plot. But again, it's not necessarily a BAD thing, because it did join the previous movie with it relatively seamlessly! And yes, even though I myself didn't cry, many may definitely need tissues because of the last scene. Minor spoiler: Nobody \"dies\", but there is a very touching and pivotal moment that will probably bring many to tears. Anyway, in a nutshell, a VERY good movie!

{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Toy Story 4 — Finally saw this movie (about time!). It was really good (Big surprise there *sarcasm*). I was reminded immediately how much I love these characters and this series. The animation in this movie was incredible. The details they put into every little thing is amazing. Just when you think the animation couldn’t get any better, they go ahead and one-up themselves going further and further into the details of everything. This movie was definitely more centered around Woody and BoPeep (and Forky) than any others, which I was fine with, but did have me missing not seeing the other characters quite as much. There were a couple scenes toward the end that got me a little bit teary-eyed, but I still think nothing tops the end of Toy Story 3. That being said, I really enjoyed this movie and think it was a good addition to the series. They could’ve called it quits after Toy Story 3 and I would’ve been happy, but Pixar knows how to handle this series and these characters and  put together a great movie. Toy Story 3 is still my favorite of the series, but Toy Story 4 was really entertaining and addressed some newer themes that kept things feeling fresh and engaging.

{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My Childhood is complete. Toy Story has been in my heart for a very long time! I was born to love the Toy Story franchise! I wasn't born before Toy Story (1995) but I was 1 year older than Toy Story 2 (1999)! I love these characters so much! They have been in my heart for a very long time! I was just like Andy growing up. I'd play with my toys constantly every day. and always took care of them! So...Toy Story 4 (2019) This movie was EXCELLENT!! Great story, full of heart and laughter! Woody has always been my favorite deputy for as long as I can remember! And this story is all about the cowboy. It broke me with tons of emotional scenes and heart breaking decisions! I love the new characters they put in this movie too! Ducky and Bunny, Duke Caboom, and Forky! Why I said emotional and heart breaking is because Woody has always been loyal and watching my character grow over the years to now in Toy Story 4 (2019) It was hard for me to watch him make some sacrificing decisions. So this move I'd give it not 5 stars not even 10 stars! I give it 1,000 stars! Such a great film, and definitely worth the money! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!  I'm disappointed for the score on this website.

{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"I was incredibly disappointed with this film. This film may have single highhandedly annihilated the entire \"Toy Story\" franchise. This movie had more problems than it had main characters (which is a problem within itself). \n\nFirst of all, Buzz Lightyear (my personal favorite toy) was completely clocked by the main story-line. For a charter that was featured so heavily in the first three movies, I was incredibly upset that he seemed to only be a supporting charter. This is just the beginning. \n\nSecondly, toys are NOT made to interact with humans - periodt. Buzz Lightyear (my personal favorite toy) spoke to a human as he was being flinged into the cabinet like Forky tried to fling himself in the trash can (which happened far too many times). \n\nThird, on the subject of Forky, WHY IN THE WORLD is he not called Sporky? He is clearly a spork - as stated many times in the film. Obviously this was a clear oversight of the writers. \n\nFourth, the ventriloquist dolls featured in the film are very frightening - even more so than the Lot's-O'-Huggin' Bear from Toy Story 3. I had a very young boy sitting next to me during the showing, and he jumped and was severely frightened each time they appeared.\n\nFirth of all, Gabby Gabby did not deserve Woody's help. She stole his voice box! I was incredibly disappointed that Gabby Gabby has not thrown in the trash to be compounded. Woody lost his voice box, and it was forgotten by the rest of the toys! This lack of realism is why the Toy Story franchise is failing. \n\nAnd lastly, Woody should not been the only toy to abandon the pack. Woody and Buzz have been together since the first movie, and it was cruel to split them up over another toy. I was deeply saddened by this creative decision from the writers.","displayName":"Hayden V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-11T04:03:43.186Z","updateDate":"2019-07-11T04:04:05.086Z","user":{"userId":"978149626","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hayden V","accountLink":"/user/id/978149626"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 11, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"You had the perfect ending with Toy Story 3 then you make this movie and f#%ked it up. Way to go Disney. This could have been a bunch of animated shorts to extend the story and not messed up the original ending but no, they went ahead and make this steaming pile. Don't even get me started on 'Forky'. How many little kids do you know are having an existential crisis? They could have had Gabby take over for Bo Peep so she could be with Woody and the others again but no, Bonnie suddenly gets bored with Woody and is more attached to Forky, who should have fallen to pieces after his first day. I will say that I wish Gabby was the antagonist in the last film because she has a much better motive than Lotso. This film was basically just made to justify making Pixar Pier mostly toy story themed so it stays relevant and more toys can be added. I guess they're tired of making terrible live-action remakes and are trying to tank their animation department too.","displayName":"Stephanie L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100006203020259/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-20T07:03:56.569Z","updateDate":"2019-07-20T07:03:56.569Z","user":{"userId":"958781812","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stephanie L","accountLink":"/user/id/958781812"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 20, 2019"},

His undying loyalty and sacrifice for the good of whatever kid owns him is a heartwarming spectacle on screen. The new characters are interesting and full of life. They all feel like they fit perfectly into the plot of the movie and are not just an excuse to sell more toys to kids. Keanu Reeves' steals the show with his character, Duke Caboom.

{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Toy Story was a perfect trilogy in a world where cinematic threepeats often fail (think Matrix, Pirates, Spider-Man, and the most dreaded of all, Godfather III). Toy Story was about why we love our possessions. Toy Story 2 was about why our possessions love us. And the now penultimate Toy Story 3 capped it off clean with why we eventually have to part with our possessions. So the questions us film purists had when Pixar announced a fourth entry were: What's left? Artistic merit or cash cow? Why toy with a perfect set? If third movies are bad, fourths usually get the reboot, or take off in a different direction, frequently getting lost. Part 4 was particularly unkind to Indiana Jones, whose perfect trilogy long stood as a cinematic staple, until crystal skulled aliens transported the archaeologist to an awkward dimension. It's that whole can't leave a good thing alone business. Scream took the meta approach, making jokes about how fourth movies function in a franchise. I'm happy to report Toy Story 4 was also self-aware, if only a little less poignant. \n\nToy Story 4 outright admits to themes of throwing itself in the garbage and having nothing left to do, roles played by Forky (Tony Hale) and Woody (Tom Hanks) respectively. Woody learned some time ago that the only important role he had as a toy was to love his kid to the fullest, to be willing to do anything for them. He soon realizes Bonnie (Madeleine McGraw) is no longer interested in playing with him, an awfully contrived plot device since he was just recently her favorite toy, and she still plays with the others. \n\nBonnie is terrified to start kindergarten orientation, and Woody wants to help. He shows up at school with her and assembles some trash for arts and crafts, in which she concocts the now infamous Forky, our first born-anew handcrafted toy. There's a moment of consciousness-awareness that's both frightening and hilarious, reminding us of clones or replicants awakening in sci-fi films. Bonnie loves Forky, but Forky hates his existence, feeling bound to the trash from whence he came. Woody has to convince him that life is worth living, but Forky's persistence winds them both on the street as lost toys. Nothing new to the formula, the toys set out to accomplish one smaller task and wind up far away, homeward bound. So what's fresh?\n\nToys, a whole lot of them, so much that most of the former cast is reduced to small appearances or cameos. Key & Peele reunite as Ducky & Bunny, carnival toys stuck to each other and a shooting gallery wall with little hope of ever having a kid, until Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) intervenes. Officer Giggle McDimple's (Ally Maki) is one of those even the smallest can make a difference characters, Bo Peep's sidekick. Perhaps the most anticipated comes from the voice of America's favorite urban legend, Keanu Reeves as the fitting stuntman Duke Kaboom, yet another abandoned toy driven by anguish. And a softer, more sympathetic antagonist riles things up as our heroes try to get home, Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), accompanied by her creepy henchmen, the Dummies.\n\nThere's a lot of fun and spectacle, but for the caliber franchise that Toy Story has been, was it necessary? At times, it does seem to be on repeat, upping the ante to the third's ‘say goodbye' tear-jerking – \"higher on the strings, Randy [Newman].\" Has Pixar found a comfortable, safe formula that we're just easily susceptible to? I'm not sure I can identify the bold, overarching point, which each of the others have, nor any evolution, besides technology, with incredible texture/motion animation in the carnival at night, and a photorealistic cat. The flashback to losing Bo Peep (Annie Potts) is hardly an impactful starting point, although her re-emergence into the story, as a toy-wielding camper glides Bo and Woody right into each other, was magical. Still, it seems this film is made mostly to get Woody and Bo back together, which would've made for a better TV short film.\n\nThere's some confusion as to where our sympathies should lie. Woody and Bo are in dispute over who's really ‘lost.' Gabby is too cruel to be so easily forgiven. Bonnie's despair over losing Forky gets annoying. Whatever sympathy we lose for her is traded for dad (Jay Hernandez), who's having a Clark Griswold experience, one failure after the other on a family road trip. And while some of the humor works, some overstays it's welcome, particularly Forky's garbage montage, making it's point about his destiny redundant.\n\nWe've been told Toy Story 4 will be the end, but I'm not convinced. I was taught a five-act structure in school, and this easily feels like act IV, the false resolution. It's probably more wishful thinking, as the voice actors aren't getting any younger; we already bade farewell to the late Don Rickles (Mr. Potato Head) for this round. But I think fans are owed a more satisfying ending than this ‘going rogue' business, which I'll not elaborate on. There's no shortage of fun and laughter, and it's ultimately worth seeing. But by Toy Story standards, it's a bit like going from a Buzz Lightyear multi-feature space ranger action figure to an old, worn, pull-string Woody doll. And yet we still love that cowboy, so it's got a friend in us.\n","displayName":"Tiberio S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/832747305/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-15T22:47:58.485Z","updateDate":"2019-07-15T22:48:22.557Z","user":{"userId":"789707717","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tiberio S","accountLink":"/user/id/789707717"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 15, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Heartfelt, funny and gorgeously animated, \"Toy Story 4\" is a thrilling final chapter in the beloved animated series. Packed with plenty of colourful characters, hilarious laughs and terrific performances from an A-list cast, the film delivers everything that fans could have hoped for. At a first glance, extending the series may have seemed like an impossible feat. However, director Josh Cooley has pulled it off seamlessly. Not only does \"Toy Story 4\" bring back the beloved toys we've grown to adore, but it also introduces fresh faces into the cast. Forky, for instance, is the funniest character and a standout in the new additions to the cast. Although \"Toy Story 4\" offers fun family entertainment, it is not a film without flaws. At times, it feels slightly rushed and doesn't give all the characters a chance to shine. Due to its rushed pacing, it isn't quite on par with its predecessors in terms of quality. Nevertheless, fans of the franchise will definitely enjoy \"Toy Story 4\" and so will movie-goers seeking family-friendly entertainment this summer season. If this truly is the last time we see Woody and his friends on the big-screen, its a fitting farewell to the toys we've grown to love and adore.","displayName":"Hassan I","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1451588882/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-31T22:43:58.873Z","updateDate":"2019-09-01T21:23:26.862Z","user":{"userId":"911164540","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hassan I","accountLink":"/user/id/911164540"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 31, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"\"To infancy and beyond!\"\n\nHow attached are you to Andy and his Toys, Woody, Buzz and the gang? Don't bother answering because, like me, I already know just how dependent you are on these peerless Pixar characters. Chances are you've grown up with these movies...\n\n...Having watched Toy Story 4, I further suggest that these movies have grown up with you! And they have just earned a First Class Honours Degree. Forget going to college with Andy  - this incomparable quadrilogy provides the most nuanced examination of Attachment Theory imaginable. \n\nAttachment, in psychology, refers to the special bond and the lasting relationships that children form with one or more adults.  \n\nUnderlying the truly genius Toy Story saga is an in-depth cognitive, psycho-dynamic and socio-psychological exploration, of the theory of Attachment.\n\nThe saga initially tackles Attachment Parenting during the childhood years, involving all the ways parents must hold a child close for reliance on a secure dependence to be established. We can view Woody as a substitute child dependent on the love and attention of his primary carer, Andy. But we can just as easily see Woody as the carer, with Andy dependent on the safe love provided to him by his trusty toy. Take your pick; it works both ways, just as the films work harmoniously as entertaining flicks for kids and detailed studies of the Attachment Theory.\n\nDon't believe me? Well ok then, push the button, spread the wings and watch my theory fly...\n...or at the very least fall with style:\n\nToy Story \n\nAs with babies, we learn from Woody that toys have a kind of biological drive to seek proximity to a primary carer (or a child to play with them) for survival and fulfilment. Woody et al are dependent on the physical and emotional availability of Andy to play with them. We see that the toys' relationships with their child owners are crucial to their trust of others, their understanding of relationships generally and their feelings about themselves. Just check out the juxtaposition between Andy's contented toy box with the tragically nervous and dysfunctional behaviour of Sid's mistreated and mutated playthings! The drive in Woody for closeness to Andy promotes attachment behaviours, which helps him feel safe and wanted. Woody's development of attachment relationships continues as he gradually learns to think about others' feelings, manage relationships with his peers and co-operate with others, not least the insufferable new addition to the family, Buzz Lightyear!\n\nSynchronous with the above theme, Andy himself - throughout the first movie - is dependent on his toys, not least his trusty old chum Woody. His attachment to Woody is self evident - the cuddly gunslinger equivalent of a comfort blanket.\n\nToy Story 2\n\nIn the sequel, Woody is no longer the selfish and dependent infant. He is growing into adolescence, and in so doing is learning more about self. As an adolescent who has benefitted from regular love, affection and ‘favourite toy' status from Andy, our maturing cowboy is reassured enough by Attachment to begin flirting with autonomy - more individual responsibility, more expression of individuality and a yearning to direct and lead his own life. Of course he is not quite ready to cut loose, and dutifully, nay triumphantly, returns to the safe haven of his room with Andy... \n\n...albeit he is no longer the vulnerable and defenceless old rag tag cowboy we had seen in the first film but rather a self assured collectible leader of the Round Up Gang! \n\nMeanwhile, in the second instalment of the saga, Andy is growing into adolescence himself. No longer quite so dependent on his toys, he even briefly casts Woody aside, daring to travel to camp without his old ally. For Heaven's sake, the bewildered cowboy even finds himself gathering dust on the shelf! Woody feels like any parent who suddenly realises his child would prefer to go to the pictures with his friend instead of his mum and dad. Like Woody though, he can't stay away for long just yet, and runs giddily back into the protective safety of his beloved Sheriff. Attachment runs deep don't you know!\n\nThe latter two entries then move seamlessly yet suddenly into an exploration of Detachment Parenting during the adolescent years, involving all the ways parents must let the child go for a confident independence to grow.\n\nToy Story 3\n\nWoody has proven very good at becoming an integral part of Andy's life, and vice versa, Great, I hear you all proclaim. After all, close parental attachment nurtures a founding sense of interpersonal trust and a solid platform for the development that follows.\n\nHowever, it's not all rosy in the garden. Highly attached parents of children (or toys) can have a devil of a time not excessively holding on, hovering over and helping out when the time for more parental detachment arrives. \n\nBut time waits for no-one - not even a digitally created cowboy doll! Without adequate parental detachment, developing individuality for identity and responsibility for independence are very difficult to accomplish. \n\nLetting go - I know, I'm already welling up thinking about the scene - is done through parental permission and acceptance. Both Woody and Andy - whether you view either or both as the maturing child or the heartbroken parent - converge to permit and accept a final parting of the ways. Detachment can be THE most painful process. Parents have to let go some life agenda they had for the child, \"We determine the direction you take;\" to \"We accept that you must set your own course through life.\" - \"THANKS GUYS\"! 😭\n\nToy Story 4\n\nFor Woody, just as for any child or indeed parent, detachment can be an emotionally costly process. He has now let go of Andy, who is no longer his to control or his to rely upon. \n\nIn infancy and childhood, through attachment, the child trusts in dependence on the parent, but in adolescence, through parental detachment, the child learns to trust in dependence on self. Woody, as you view him a grown child who has flown the nest, is no longer tied to a carer. He can make his own choices; choose his own path; take his own fork in the road!\n\nBut what about Woody the primary carer? Parental detachment to foster independence is neither an expression of parental desertion nor abandonment of parental love. While daring to let go of Andy, and then ultimately Bonnie, Woody still holds fast to his commitment of continuing to care. He will, as Forky wisely observes, never get over Andy. And he requires the assurance of Buzz that \"She'll be ok, Bonnie will be ok\", before he gives his final permission and acceptance to cut loose with Bo Peep! \n\nWhether the parent or the older adolescent, Woody must pay a price of this new independence; he must, like Bo Peep already has, learn to live with the new challenges independent of his prior attachment - Decide for myself; Define myself; Direct myself. \"To infancy...and beyond\"!","displayName":"Andrew T","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/602854637/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-09T20:40:42.516Z","updateDate":"2019-07-09T20:40:42.554Z","user":{"userId":"976923863","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andrew T","accountLink":"/user/id/976923863"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"I loved the movie my kids enjoyed it so much. The only issue we had was the seating we were so uncomfortable the seats where not like the regular priced movie theater seating. They were old small horribly dirty and uncomfortable they did not recline and my son would not sit in the seat so he sat on my lap. He has been to other movie theaters and sat just fine but not this time. I was very disappointed and felt as if I was cheated out of our experience give that the other areas of seating that were not IMAX where way nicer and comfortable. I paid extra thinking I would get the best and I felt worse, I even complained to the Manager and all he could say is IMAX is not part of the other regular priced theater which I for one didn't understand if its in the theater it should all be the same especially if I paid good movie well over 100.00 dollars for my family to enjoy 1hr 45 min of being uncomfortable. Next time I will rethink paying extra for IMAX experience and just go to another place","displayName":"Adel","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-09T20:07:37.014Z","updateDate":"2019-07-09T20:07:37.014Z","user":{"userId":"40f5213a-ffee-47a1-a266-8400c2939704","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Adel","accountLink":null},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"We all thought exactly the same thing when Pixar announced they were going to makeToy Story 4, What?! The third film ended the series perfectly. However after seeing Toy Story 4 I have to say I am very impressed and surprised. I really liked this film. It is definitely the weakest of the Quadrilogy for me, however that doesn't say all that much as all the movies are so good. Pixar have done it again. They have put in so much care, effort and time into this. It's been 9 years since the 3rd film so there was a lot of expectation. This is a funny, moving, charming film which is a great extension of Toy Story 3's ending assuming this is the last one. The ending is satisfying, it's not super dark and intense like the incinerator from part 3 but it leaves you feeling warm. The new characters are all awesome, especially Gabby Gabby. Her character arc was very emotional, we think at first she is the antagonist however that is since revealed not to be true. I also think Duke Caboom, Ducky and Bunny are all hilarious.This is also a greta ending for Woody and I feel like Woody's character has really come full circle and has matured. Its great seeing Bo back and rekindling her relationship with Woody and seeing how her character has changed. The music is classic Toy Story and it works. It moves at a great pace. Its a wonderfully surprising return to these characters but the only criticism I have is that a lot of the original characters don't get a lot to do, which is a slight shame but other than that, well done Pixar! :) This movie was unnecessary but I am glad you made it. But now is a good place to stop. The Toy Story films have been consistently fantastic and the 4 movies work and I really feel this film is the official ending of the Toy Story saga and it should stay that way. I would score this film a 9/10","displayName":"Ollie P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001287176093/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-29T09:37:48.844Z","updateDate":"2019-08-29T09:38:31.743Z","user":{"userId":"904047929","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ollie P","accountLink":"/user/id/904047929"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 29, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Toy Story 4 is a generally enjoyable film, made better by the incredible animation that Pixar delivers. The lighting and shadows darting across Bo-Peep's facial features are a level of detail that can easily be taken for granted and it is fun to watch just to appreciate the spectacle and feat of CGI. \n\nThat said, though, it was a little questionable at first as to whether this film was needed. Nobody was really asking for Toy Story number 4 . When the news was announced that Disney and Pixar were doing it I remember wondering why, what story was left to tell? We had concluded the tale, Toy Story 3 was a beautiful end to an animated saga that had carried a generation through childhood into adolescence, and now they were creating a fourth? Could we, as an audience that had departed this train and exited the platform be bothered to get back on board? I mean, where was it even headed? We all know how this goes, Disney did it with Pirates of the Caribbean, a new trilogy of films that can't live up to the originals and succeed only in tainting the franchise.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised though to find myself exiting the cinema, having watched the most recent installment, with a sense of closure that I didn't even realise I needed.\n\nI mean think about it this way. The end of Toy Story 3 left Woody nodding a solemn farewell to Andy, about to jump into a new life with Bonnie, the adorable and excitable kindergartener who could help these toys continue fulfilling their purpose as children's playthings. It was a bittersweet end, we connected with Andy as he clung on desperately to the remnants of childhood, but were happy to see another child find joy in playing with the characters that we'd grown to love through 3 incredible movies. \n\nBut nobody was asking, yet probably should have been, what happens in 6 or 7 years time when Bonnie is too old to play with these toys? Are we going to have to pick up the story again and watch them all find a new home? And what about Bo-Peep? Where the heck is she? And what even defines a toy? Why are other seemingly inanimate objects in this franchise not sentient, and what happens if something that was not previously labelled a toy is suddenly redefined as one by a child playing with it?  \n\nToy Story 4, often horrifyingly, addresses all of these unanswered questions, and delivers a hilarious, emotional punch that nobody knew they needed. We are introduced to Forky, an agonised creation made from trash that suffers an existential crisis of identity whilst being, literally, talked down from the ledge by Woody. Somehow Disney turn this into a storyline that lasts 100 minutes, and though it felt more like the tying of several ends that I wasn't aware were even loose until they were picked up in this movie, it was nonetheless enjoyable to watch and entertaining throughout. Let us not forget, this is a kids film, and the giggles and laughter echoing through the screening are testament to the fact that this delivers to it's target audience. \n\nWill Toy Story 5 happen? Knowing Disney - yes. Should it? Probably not.","displayName":"Leo K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-11T18:03:47.394Z","updateDate":"2019-08-11T18:03:47.394Z","user":{"userId":"978195005","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leo K","accountLink":"/user/id/978195005"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 11, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Astounding animation and overall a good plot. I did like it better than the third movie overall, but I felt it was an unnecessary addition to the franchise and destroys all the messages of the previous movies. \n(Spoilers ahead...)\nMy main issues were as follows:\nFirstly it makes no sense to me that Bonnie would play with every toy except Woody, especially after she seemed so interested in playing with him in the third movie. Secondly, the whole voice box thing rubbed me the wrong way how Gabbie Gabbie blackmailed him to get it and not only kept it bu the end of the movie but also got a happy ending... it just kinda felt very off to me. I think it wouldve been more powerful if shed found a kid without needing the voice box... sends a better message of not needing to fix yourself to find a friend. That goes against the message of the precious movies, especially the second where theyd always say Andy will love you no matter what and Woody dealt with his arm being ripped and Andy still wanting to play with him regardless. Lastly, the idea Woody would just leave the entire gang of toys for Bo seems a bit out of character. And goes against the main theme of the other three films. Overall, I did like the movie due to the sheer amazement I had watching Pixars animation quality progress and come such a long way, but story wise it felt more like a fanfiction than something true to what gave Toy Story its heart in the first place and so fell flat.","displayName":"Moki","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-04T09:01:27.373Z","updateDate":"2019-08-04T09:01:27.373Z","user":{"userId":"74b99079-92e8-4bd0-8b68-779a005df851","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Moki","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 04, 2019"},

The relationship between Woody and Buzz was the best thing about Toy Story, but in this version, Woody takes the lead all the way.  It's Woody, Woody, Woody. The plot was shallow and not well thought out.  The storyline between Bopeep and Woody being a thing never happened.  For them to go off into the sunset together, first you have to develop the love story.  How do toys fall in love? Date? Where was the moment where they both knew they were in love?  There was no first kiss.  There was potential there to develop a great storyline, but the creative genius must've fizzled out. It seemed shallow on so many levels.  The ventriloquist dolls seemed to introduce a level of horror.

{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The first half of this movie was great. Well animated, funny, cute. I know my child enjoys the idea of toys having a reality that adults are just to myopic to see but that kids fully enjoy. I thought the movie took a turn for the worse (from 5 stars down to 4) when the story became too much about the toys, and less of the cute interaction between the toys and the humans. Then, it became downright creepy when (spoiler alert) the doll Gabby went psycho on Woody, having her mannequin \"goons\" on woody to basically harvest his organs (voice box) for her own selfish enterprise. Really, I don't know if other adults picked up on this even though I'm sure the kids didn't. I honestly could not decide if Gabby was supposed to be a villain in this plot, yet the story was told as though she were a sympathetic character. Maybe I'm overthinking this. I think for the kiddos, still a great flick. For the adults, maybe a good opportunity for a restroom break halfway through.

{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This is undoubtedly the very best of the four movies. Think of what a space shuttle is in comparison to an ox cart. That's how far Toy Story 1 and 4 are apart. While the first one was surely groundbreaking in the way that it was the very first movie completely produced on PCs, this latest edition is a pure work of art. Even the third one was undeniably an animation with quite clear cartoon characteristics. But the fourth one goes actually \"To infinity and beyond\", and really far beyond. Not only the toy characters look real and alive, but everything in the surrounding looks real as well. From a car to a Ferries Wheel, from a simple can to a complete antique shop. It's absolutely unbelievable. Judging from the laughter inside the cinema everybody obviously had a great time (only adults) as the movie isn't only way more advanced technologically, but it's also sweeter, funnier and wittier. 8/10 points.","displayName":"Giorgio G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-11T21:21:25.228Z","updateDate":"2019-07-11T21:21:25.228Z","user":{"userId":"975555794","realm":"RT","displayName":"Giorgio G","accountLink":"/user/id/975555794"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 11, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"I REALLY wanted to like this movie. Toy Story 3 wrapped the story lines up so well that it would seem there wasn’t a need for another sequel. However, I was still excited to see this one. The movie started off very promising as they did a recap of Woody and the gang as they transitioned from Andy to Bonnie. Moving forward to Bonnie’s first day at kindergarten where Woody was there for her was really touching. Then we started the story about Forky and things started going downhill. Forky as a toy character was cute and funny but the story fell off the tracks when Woody went on his quest to find Bo Peep. Bo Peep was a minor character in the Toy Story saga so to see this character take over the movie was disappointing. Suddenly Woody is almost useless and Buzz becomes a blithering idiot. This is totally out of character for Woody, Buzz, and Bo Peep. The rest of the gang we love so much was barely in the movie. Bullseye isn’t in it at all. The story would have been much better had Jessie been Woody’s partner in finding Forky and Bo Peep. However, Jessie was just an accessory in the background here. It was jolting to watch Woody become so useless when he had always been so clever and resourceful in the other films. Even more insulting was expecting the audience to accept a brain dead and cowardly Buzz Lightyear. Why did the writers do this? Finally, the ending was a real clunker. Woody would NEVER abandon his friends like he did here. He would NEVER give up on his “kid” even if he was no longer her favorite toy. It all just felt so wrong. I kept waiting for the tears to well up but this ending was not emotional at all. So was the movie really awful? No, it wasn’t. Did it at least live up to the other three films in the series? Not even remotely! Despite trying my very best to love this film it just didn’t work for me. What a shame.

{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"( Warning, Toy Story 4 spoilers ahead. ) \n\nToy Story was my childhood. I grew up watching reruns of the earlier Toy Story movies, and the ending for the third movie was very satisfying to me. Until I watched the fourth installment, and I fell in love with the whole franchise again. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this film from beginning to end -- I was a mix of emotions. Props to Pixar for creating Gabby Gabby, a villain that actually has character to her. Someone that you can sympathize with, and understand why she acted the way she did. I also really liked the newer characters. They're all very diverse. \n\nCons, is the heavily lack of screen time for the original characters. I barely noticed the older classics like Hamm, Mr potato head, Bullseye the first time I watched the movie. Even Jessie didn't have much of a spotlight. \n\nAll in all, I really like the fourth installment. And honestly, i'm secretly hoping for a fifth in the next decade or so. I usually don't enjoy films or shows that have more than two or three parts to them, but Toy Story 4 was really, really good. \n\nAnd even if a Fifth movie isn't coming anytime soon, i'd love more shorter films like The Toy Story of Terror, Hawaiian Vacation and more. Hopefully showcasing how Buzz and the gang has been doing, or how Woody has been holding up at the carnival.

{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I loved the movie overall, but it pulled at my heart strings a little too much. Im used to a good amount of humor throughout the toy story movies, but this one was a little too sad throughout. Dont get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE the message that it sends to not judge a book by its cover. The main villain of the movie has a reason for the way that they are and despite their evil, woody helps them. I love that. It will hopefully teach people to look to infinity and beyond the surface....allowing you to get to know someone that is acting mean or like a bully.

{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"At my daughter's request we saw this in the theater the day after her seventh birthday.   There are some really interesting parts to it – the Forky the spork, for example, who doesn't want to be a toy and has a \"death drive\" of throwing himself into the trash; and conversely, the doll Gabby, who feels she can only be a complete toy with a working voicebox, and is willing to hurt others (in particular, Woody) to acquire one.  Toy Story 4 probably features the least interaction with humans, and specifically families, of the entire series, a gap which is partly filled by Woody, who tries to parent Forky, and Bo Peep, who looks after her sheep and other \"independent\" toys.  And in the end, both choose a life together, away from humans, after helping Gabby find a girl for her.  Is this what it looks like when toys grow up themselves, or is it more like retirement?   While neither kiddo is especially into dolls or action figures, this series still retains its charm for them, I think because it captures the mystery of childhood play.  And that can sometimes be violent and unjust, as demonstrated by this film.

Between the creepy menacing marionettes and the creepy extra cut scene at the end with the giant attacking laser eyed stuff animals attacking people, I didn't feel comfortable with my three year old watching. For that matter my Toy Story obsessed toddler didn't find any interest in the film. \nBuzz seemed to revert back to OG Buzz who knew nothing about being a toy despite the fact that he's been a toy for more than 6 years. \n\nIn my opinion it was a sad but unsatisfying end to the 4 part movie series. \nI'm marking this down as a fail. \nKeep the Toy Story magic alive and skip the very last installment of the series.","displayName":"Kinsie R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100006705095341/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-30T06:26:15.493Z","updateDate":"2019-11-30T06:28:09.651Z","user":{"userId":"969006395","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kinsie R","accountLink":"/user/id/969006395"},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 30, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Now you have to see this in the way that a children would see this to fully appreciate this movie. I really liked this, the animation was just out of this WORLD! Then why did I put this movie at \"only\" 4 stars?! Because of two things, first, Bo peep became kind of trash, she should have stayed the same, now she was less nice and seemed more superficial the other thing is because Bo peep was so focused of just being a free toy, it made Woody go away from Buzz and Jessie!

{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"At this point everyone knows what Pixar is… THE ANIMATION GOAT. They have been just putting out banger after banger for years and they do not seem to be stopping any time soon.\n\nToy Story however has always been their most prized franchise. It is the film that started it all, and it is easily the most popular franchise of any that Pixar has put out. To be honest 3 is so perfect and heartwarming that it felt like the perfect end of the franchise. When people heard this was happening, and saw the first trailer, there was many reservations heading into this.\n\nNever in doubt though Pixar still brings the heat, especially with the Toys. This story is about how the toys new owner Bonnie makes a new friend Forky, and he decides to get lost in the forest. Woody goes after him because he is just so noble, and winds up on the adventure of a lifetime. Any more and I would kinda be spoiling so lets just get to the grades and we will finalize another fantastic entrant to the Pixar canon.\n\nAnimation – A It is Pixar and they always do it right. There were some legitimately incredible shots that could have been in live action movies, particularly one where Woody and Forky are walking down a highway. They also managed to make a spork look normal and fit into the universe which is an achievement in itself.\n\nVoice Cast – A+ All the big dogs are back, Hanks, Allen, Cusack, Ratzenberger, and all the old pals. However, we get four all time performances from new characters: Key and Peele as two bears that kids try to win at the carnival, Ally Maki as a toy cop, and Keanu Reeves (in the midst of a Keanuassaince) dominating the screen as a toy daredevil. It really does not get better than this as far as voices.\n\nMusic – B The score was typically very good, and they brought back You've Got a Friend in Me, but nothing really too crazy to put this over the edge for me.\n\nStory – A This is where the worry came in for the Pixar heads, because the first three were so satisfying we did not want them ruined. This felt very natural though and did not have to retread anything from the past. It gave us a true ending to Woody's journey and at the end of the day this was always his story. I loved how they brought back Bo Peep, and the arc of the villain Gabby Gabby as well. As always Pixar comes through when they need to.\n\n*A couple other tidbits\n\n- Bonnie kind of stinks compared to Andy, There I said it.\n\n- Jeff Garlin had like two amazing moments in this as well which always puts a smile on my face.\n\nWe may have been a tad worried going in, but as always Pixar knocked this one out of the park. Another incredible story about the Toys and another notch in their unrivaled filmography.\n\nJuice Rating:\n96/100","displayName":"Aaron J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/518240958/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-07T02:35:57.328Z","updateDate":"2019-11-07T02:35:59.145Z","user":{"userId":"822300881","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aaron J","accountLink":"/user/id/822300881"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 07, 2019"},

Toy story 4 brings all the charms that make this franchise so incredible along with a premise that will resonate with older audiences while entertaining the kids. With its lighthearted plot, detailed and gorgeous animation, and tons of laughs, this new entry earns its place on this immaculate film series, even if the plot itself isn't as strong as previous ones. Josh Cooley does an incredible job introducing new characters, bringing others back, and paying tribute to the primary with an ending that's highly emotional and impactful thanks to the journey and situations we have seen this characters go through in other installments. But Toy Story 4 doesn't only succeed for what it follows but also has its deeper topics and enough twists and insight to set itself apart.

As many have said it isn't quite as emotional as the end of the 3rd film, however I couldn't but get a little teary eyed not at Bopeep and Woody, but at Buzz and Woody's goodbye. I grew up on the original 3 movies and although I adore this film and it is probably the 2nd best to date (after the 2nd of course). However, I can't help but ask them not to make another. I feel that if the studio pushes for another simply because they do well it will make the films loose their unique magic. I do appriciate the gap between the 3rd and 4th, but I hope it is atleast another 5 years if number 5 comes out.

{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"\"Look at the fluff.\"\n\nWoody and the gang go with their new owner Bonnie on a road trip before she starts kindergarten and adjust to their new comrade Forky.... a toy Bonnie created herself. While on the road Woody runs into Bo Peep who's now adjusted to life as a lost toy.\n\nYeah I'll just.... come out with it here, I didn't like this movie. And aside from Cars this would be the worst Pixar movie I've seen so far.\n\nI'm a massive Toy Story and Pixar fan since 1995. Toy Story changed how I thought, it's THAT kind of movie for me. And I'd be here all day talking about what I love about Toy Story 1, 2 and I'd be here for a week talking about what I love about Toy Story 3 which is a true masterpiece.\n\nToy Story 3 was a PERRRRRFECT ending to the story of Woody and Buzz. They faced death together.... and survived. You can't top that for an adventure.... and they sure don't in Toy Story 4.\n\nIt's not a bad movie just... it didn't do much for me.\n\nI'll tell you one thing that bugged me when it was over was I could count on one hand the number of times I laughed. Where the hell were the jokes in this movie? That bit where the bunny and the chick hatch their plan... get it... but where they go over how they're gonna steal the antique shop owner's key... is one of the funniest gags in ANY Pixar movie. That was the first laugh for me and it was maybe 50 minutes into the movie. That's not the kind of joke/laugh ratio I like.\n\nForky... lemme talk about Forky....... Forky sucks ass.\n\nWhen I saw that character in the trailer I had a feeling that character would be annoying. And he's not annoying it's just... they don't do ANYTHING interesting with him at all. This idea of NEW LIFE and they don't do anything cool with it. It's Frankenstein's monster! The number of directions you can do with the creation of a toy and how they begin life seems infinite and... it felt like they threw all of that away. What a letdown. And they spend the first 20 minutes of the movie with his character, too which sucks.\n\nIt's a decent story, in these movies they've managed to do a great job giving us these takes on life for toys. For some toys it's about being owned and loved by a kid and the idea of being lost or abandoned is a hell without end....... unless you're Bo evidently.\n\nBo is a whole new and great character, living this almost Mad Max in the wasteland existence driving around in a skunk car.... long story that's never explained. And I don't wanna give away where the story goes but they make that an option for some of our characters and it's an interesting place to take the story..... but I've seen WAY more interesting stuff happen in these movies.\n\nI think the biggest problem this movie has is Toy Story 3.\n\nToy Story 3 had everything, a great and HARROWING story, laugh out loud moments every other minute, fantastic new characters, a STELLAR villain in Lotso Huggin' Bear and a climax I don't think Pixar will ever top, frankly.\n\nNot to mention the best opening scene in a Pixar movie with this sort of fantasy that I read as what literally happens for toys when they're played with, they're transported to this other reality where anything is possible. It made Woody's desire to be with Andy make even MORE sense. Who wouldn't want to be a part of adventures like that.\n\nSo I was pretty bummed when Toy Story 4 by the time it was over had nothing in common in Toy Story 3. There IS no villain, no Sid, no Stinky Pete, no Lotso, no life or death stakes.... and wow is that a nice way to make me care less about what happens in an adventure story.\n\nAnd the ending was.... so underwhelming to me. Like infuriatingly underwhelming.\n\nAfter the pitch perfect The End closure in Toy Story 3, they give us a NEW ending that was so left field and lame to me and sent me out of the theater with a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nAnd also as a fan of these movies I was crushed that the characters I grew to love like Jessie, Bullseye, Hamm, Potato Head, Rex... aside from Woody, Buzz and Bo the characters I knew were relegated to almost cameos in their own movie. It's like watching an X-Men movie and the only characters that get scenes are Wolverine, Xavier and Jean Grey..... don't gimme all these new characters when we're not done with the old ones yet!\n\nIt's not the kind of sequel I hate where it makes the other films worse but based on its own merits... aside from Woody and Bo's story and the quality of the animation this movie did nothing for me.\n\nNever mind the Toy Story movies, after incredible works of art like Inside Out and Coco coming out of Pixar this movie just seemed cookie cutter to me.\n\nToy Story 4 is a HUUUUUUGE letdown for me.","displayName":"Kurt F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/760094471/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-09-23T22:13:07.460Z","updateDate":"2019-09-23T22:13:07.460Z","user":{"userId":"804534564","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kurt F","accountLink":"/user/id/804534564"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 23, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"When I first heard they were making a Toy Story 4, I didn't think it was necessary at all. Toy Story 3 ended the story perfectly, what more could be done with it? Not to mention that it's a Pixar sequel made in the 2010s, which don't exactly have a great reputation. Toy Story 3 was great, Cars 2 was bad, Monsters University was okay, Finding Dory was good but forgettable (no pun intended), Cars 3 was okay and Incredibles 2 was a lot of fun but not as memorable as the first movie. It didn't help that none of the Toy Story 4 trailers impressed me. I walked into this movie cautiously optimistic. I hoped it would be at least as good as Incredibles 2 but I was ready for the possibility of a disappointment. However, after seeing the movie, I can confidently say that they did it again. They made another great Toy Story movie. It has an engaging and emotional story, a lovable and memorable cast of characters, interesting themes and ideas, the most beautiful animation that Pixar has put to screen yet, pitch-perfect voice acting, and really great action and comedy! While Toy Story 3 was the perfect ending, I think Toy Story 4 is a great epilogue. This is probably where the story would go next, whether you like it or not. I do have some criticisms though. Some of the writing and comedic timing felt surprisingly clunky and off a couple of times and the ending does feel a little rushed. The ending of Toy Story 3 was definitely a better finale to the series as a whole, it was more epic and larger in scale, but this is more of a finale to the arcs of the main characters. I can't think of a more fitting way to end both this story and the 2010s decade of Pixar movies. It came in with a Toy Story movie and it went out with a Toy Story movie, and it looks like this is the last Pixar sequel we're going to see for a long time. It's been confirmed that there are no sequels coming out for the foreseeable future and they will be putting their focus on original films only. That sounds good to me! Overall, this is a must-see for any fan of the Toy Story movies. It just might be another instant classic. Highly recommended.","displayName":"Aidan Z","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/937912853232351/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-15T19:07:05.702Z","updateDate":"2019-09-15T19:07:05.702Z","user":{"userId":"978267048","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aidan Z","accountLink":"/user/id/978267048"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 15, 2019"},
{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Toy Story 4 seems like the type of movie that just shouldn't have worked out. The third film is loved by virtually everyone and the fourth film overrides the ending of the last movie. So, why is Toy Story 4 much better than it should've been? Well, before we get to that, let's discuss the obvious problems: Bonnie and the lack of development of old characters. The former has been the butt of jokes on the Internet thanks to her visible neglect of Woody. While this does cheapen the impact of the ending of the last movie, she's still only a 5-year-old girl and neglecting that one toy is normal behaviour for children her age. So calm down, guys. And with regards as to why the toys spend most of the movie literally and metaphorically in the back seat, I think the shorts and TV specials did help the characters go through arcs. That is, if those are even canon anyway. And they weren't completely useless nor were they interchangeable. Now that I've played the devil's advocate to the two things people have complained about, let's get down to talking about why this movie is good. The animation (uh-doy!). At times, you'd swear Pixar was just showing off, especially compared to how outdated the '90s movies look (mostly the first film, but the second film has its more awkward moments despite having much better human designs and outside scenes). And the script still has its share of emotional and comedic moments, helped by the voice acting. And I do like the new characters and am glad to see how Woody has come a long way from being the guy who'd resort to pushing Buzz under a table, out of Andy's line of sight, just so that he can get to go to Pizza Planet. I do find the ending a worthy end to Woody's story, especially considering the override. Still less esoteric than the one from Wreck-it Ralph 2, if you ask me. I enjoyed Toy Story 4 and consider it a worthy, and presumable ACTUAL, conclusion to not just the series but Pixar's \"sequel phase\" given that they have no sequels planned for the next decade...at the time I'm writing this review anyway. I just hope that they'll be able to handle the responsibility of making 2 original movies in 2020 without John Lasseter. Though Soul does have Pete Docter directing it, so I wouldn't be too concerned. Only time will tell if they'll gain \"Inside Out\" levels of acclaim.","displayName":"Jacob B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1541003829471993/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-11-16T17:56:53.288Z","updateDate":"2019-11-16T17:56:53.288Z","user":{"userId":"970980105","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jacob B","accountLink":"/user/id/970980105"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 16, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I want to start this off by saying that I am a huge Pixar fanboy but I was skeptical about the notion of making another Toy Story after the way Toy Story 3 left the series. Plus adding on to another already stellar trilogy is cause for concern. Now, sitting here writing this, I believe this is my favorite out of the four. The animation is the best in Pixar's relatively short history and the writing is almost as good. For some reason they left buzz on the back burner. Woody once again is sent through a life changing struggle that ultimately ends in a way I felt Toy Story 3 could have gone. However, the best character of the entire film is Forky, an innocent but thought provoking spork that just wanted to be trash.

{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"The Joker is a 2019 Drama/Thriller featuring the talents of Joaquin Phoenix and co. I personally really enjoyed this movie. From the amazing cinematography to the Oscar-worthy Score, this movie is one of the best to come out this year. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is one of the most mesmerizing performances I've ever seen on screen, the way he depicts his character is not realistic, but also deeply dark and disturbing to viewers. This man is able to creep out and disturb the audience just by laughing. No music or special effects needed. The plot, though flawed and at times unrealistic, is very, very dark and disturbing. I wouldn't recommend this movie to young audiences. To everyone else, though, this is a must-watch to not only become aware of many difficulties of the mentally ill, as well as why horrible things like what happens in this movie happens in real life.","displayName":"HaHa S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-12T10:01:33.681Z","updateDate":"2019-11-12T10:01:36.746Z","user":{"userId":"978385558","realm":"RT","displayName":"HaHa S","accountLink":"/user/id/978385558"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 12, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Just when you think a beloved story has reached the end, completed with a perfectly polishing bookend, there is surprisingly another chapter that takes it further; although questioned whether it is necessary and will it take it further to a new impactful direction – only if it still can be impactful if the franchise is not tired yet. The groundbreaking original \"Toy Story\" explored the relationship between inanimate object and children, only to discover the former, in plural, that the toys are alive with accustomed feelings that fuels loyalty and the need to be played with. The sentimental resonance is expressed in different ways after each chapter, including the shorts, and the supposedly concluding chapter \"Toy Story 4\" justified the further continuation with the emotional meaningfulness still ever intact for a more solidifying finale.\n\nEver since being donated to Bonnie, Andy's former childhood toys are much happier from livelier playtime with the little girl. Woody's rebooted bond with a new kid is instant as he always believes that a toy is always there for the kid, which led him to witness Bonnie's newly-created, crafted toy Forky capturing her young imaginative eyes, but the self-proclaimed trash declared otherwise when refused to be played as a toy. As the family went on a road trip with Bonnie taking the whole gang, it is up to Woody to show Forky the important role he now plays and why he should embrace the new status, but gets soon sidetracked into reuniting with his long-lost friend Bo Peep whose life on the road made her more daring and provides a new insight that will open Woody's eyes.\n\nAfter how the predecessor ended in remarkable perfection, a continuation would be met with initial doubt. Besides the treated bonus shorts released over the years afterwards in delivering more into the beloved characters' new life, a feature would need to be the final thread to the thematic core. Albeit feeling the somewhat little muddling narrative that fourth chapters tend to pace with in comparison to the previous entries and following up the best, the writing team managed to form ideas and wholesomely delivered, as well in particularly further expressing the relationship between a child and a toy from building to [fully] losing one and a toy finding its purpose. After this film, it has pretty much covered everything over the subject across the span of four films.\n\nLike each film being a toy line's latest series, it welcomes new likable characters that fits into the already-existing assortment, adding additional energy to the original. Joining the gang is Forky with Tony Hale providing much comic relief to the toying definition as well searching for the purpose with uncertain acceptance. Then around Bo Peep's clan is Giggle McDimples vocally lend by Ally Miki, Duke Caboom being another reviving brick for Keanu Reeves' stardom, hanging duo Ducky and Bunny channeling \"Key & Peele\" antics nicely for predicted amusement, and collecting dust in an antique store is Christina Hendricks' Gabby Gabby with a sympathetic depth. The new characters and additional cast easily becomes part of the series' fun soulfulness that the original cast been building from their in-synced charismatic performances since the beginning, which is in another way of looking at their efforts is functioning the heart and resonating emotional value while providing clever humor.\n\nNow this film would have been rated at four stars for the series' new low considering some decisive turns that could have been better polished than being utterly nonsensical, even if they were sources for needed plot motivation in order to reach the destined point, but \"Toy Story 4\" again marks how much computer-generated animation has technologically evolved as seen in detailed glaring reflection and facial expressions being more stretched out. It fuels the emotional range by diegetic perspective, which is where the tears started being drawn near the end for an unexpected game-changing decision for one character's truly epic journey. Imperfectly heightened to only be ranked the second best, and furthermore not at the same level nor greatly praised as \"The Hidden World\" being this year's top contender for Best Animated Feature over this one, it is nonetheless a solid chapter under final narrative assumption with justified continuation and ever loving heart to be another Pixar masterpiece – in honor to their groundbreaking achievement that has reached infinity and beyond.

{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"The worst Toy Story movie to date.\nI don't know how to feel, maybe this movie just wasn't for me. I mean, I am a 22 year old man at this point but that shouldn't really matter.\nThe previous movies have character and a plot that makes sense. This movie was just all over the place. We can start with the pacing, it was all over the place. The movie went from a slow moving plot to a montage in moments. It didn't feel coherent at all.\nThe characters that we have gotten to know through three whole movies where no where to be seen. I mean we barely got any time with Buzz Lightyear or Jessie or any of the rest of the gang.\nInstead we got a story about Woody still being sour about not being the favorite toy anymore (the plot of the first Toy Story anyone?) and how he finds his purpose in getting his kid to be happy behind the scenes.\nAnd the ending, I mean in what world would Woody leave the gang after 20+ years together just to be with one other toy? The whole plot of the other movies are that what matters most is friendship and being loyal? What happened to that.\nNonsensical plot, weird pacing and most of all it destroyed the great story that the three previous movies had built up over the course of two decades.","displayName":"Konrad J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T21:37:16.597Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T21:37:18.273Z","user":{"userId":"978184960","realm":"RT","displayName":"Konrad J","accountLink":"/user/id/978184960"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},

Forky, it's the example from what we thing we are, a lot of people thing they are \"trash\", when we can be a lot of things. But, my problem with the movie is how the old characters are  Cómo se pronuncia\nuseless, Buzz become a stupid who sais the same joke. And Rex, Potatoe head, Jessie etc...

{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The hopeful end to the greatest animated series of all time, Toy Story 4 delivers again. With beautiful animation, and a heart for its characters, kids and adults will love this film. Woody and Buzz are off an another adventure with Bonnie, and her new friend Forky. Forky is such a funny and lovable character, and his existential crisis is a very relatable feeling. Not knowing your purpose in life can be hard, and Forky is forced to grow up and abandon his love of trash cans. Bo Peep is also back with her lovable sheep trio. The ending is beautiful and bittersweet. It's a must see for sure.","displayName":"Dan F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-11T16:30:12.669Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T16:30:15.117Z","user":{"userId":"978426940","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dan F","accountLink":"/user/id/978426940"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2019"},

Avoiding spoilers make it difficult to describe, but having characters that behave appallingly \"win\" because they're somewhat sympathetic is not the message I want to send to youngsters that might watch this movie. There are ways that this could have played out but if the message they're trying to send is \"Yeah, sometimes the bad guys win\" then mission accomplished.","displayName":"Caracticus T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-02T17:39:19.836Z","updateDate":"2019-11-02T17:39:28.641Z","user":{"userId":"921822743","realm":"RT","displayName":"Caracticus T","accountLink":"/user/id/921822743"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 02, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Here comes the 4th Toy Story. Woody and Buzz and the gang are back on an adventure, but instead of Buzz rescuing Woody, it's Woody rescuing a new toy and Buzz going after them. It is basically a rehash of the 2nd Toy Story where Woody meets new toys and makes friends with them. I didn't like them adding a female star to the film aka Bo. It seems like a lot of movies are doing that these days and isn't really necessary. The new toys Gabby Gabby and  Duke Caboom I liked the most but not so much the 2 stuffed toys Bunny and Ducky. Most of the movie is focused on Woody with Buzz and the gang taking a back seat with not that many scenes. They did endure lots of comedy into this, it seems Pixar films are doing more of that these days. However, this movie lacks a main villain. We had Sid then Al then Loxo the bear, finally we have..... What no one? Gabby Gabby really isn't one so have this movie without one really just opens up the film to have more jokes instead, boo hoo. The ending was not as sad as it was in Toy Story 3, but it leaves you hanging a bit. Maybe there might be another Toy Story down the road, but I really doubt that. I'd recommend you see this Pixar film. It is still very good for a kids movie with lots of jokes and entertaining stuff throughout, especially with Keanu Reeves playing Duke Caboom.","displayName":"Adrien B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1293642169/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-10T12:41:02.631Z","updateDate":"2019-07-10T12:41:02.631Z","user":{"userId":"891899909","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adrien B","accountLink":"/user/id/891899909"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 10, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"I watched this movie at the local cinema in Rome, NY. I expected the movie to be really bad after the fantastic ending of Toy Story 3, but it didnt suck as bad as i expected. The animation is fantastic, and is almost photorealistic. However, the story felt lazy to me. The themes of the film contradict eachother. Bo Peep says that having no kid is great and that toys without a kid have a certain freedom. After giving woody a speech about this, Bo Peep helps the doll find a child, and claims that that is the better thing. So what is the theme? That a toy should be loyal to a child or that a toy should fuck their child over and be free? Very confusing. The new characters are either really stupid or not funny at all, and the old characters didnt get shit from pixar. They sat in the r.v. and tricked some grown ass men into thinking that the gps was broken. HOWEVER, the ending saved this movie from 2 stars. The ending was emotional due to great performances by Tim Allen and Tom Hanks. In conclusion, this is deffinately what would have happened after Toy Story 3, but it was not needed for the universe.

Woody grows even more because he realizes that he isn't the favorite toy but if you listen to him, he partly wanted to stay with Andy. Buzz they dumb down and make him more stupid for kids. If you are a huge Woody fan like me and you had questions about the 3rd movie, see this movie.","displayName":"Jessica F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1244147469073811/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T18:05:17.107Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T18:05:36.918Z","user":{"userId":"977801850","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jessica F","accountLink":"/user/id/977801850"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},

It never felt like that however, they still had a story to tell, and it was worth hearing. I found many of the newly introduced characters to be flat, but there were one or two who resonated with me. I just had to keep in mind that I am no longer the target audience for these films. The visuals were jaw-dropping, the different materials the toys are made out of and the animation were truly stunning.

The end of the saga is a tear-jerker and the culmination of years of the toys becoming a big part of pop culture really makes you feel for them.  Key and Peel were a great addition to the cast, along with Keanu Reeves. It was a wild ride that had highs and lows of laughter, sorrow and just a little creeped out at time (I'm looking at you dummy's!) that just fits. The biggest surprise that put a smile on my face was the credits rolling with one writer being Parks & Recreation and The Office alum, Rashida Jones.

{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"It was disappointing and worst of all forgettable. The plot felt very unpolished compared to Pixar's previous ventures with this franchise and it focused on introducing too many new characters that we had barely any screen time with any of the characters we actually care about. Woody didn't even really feel like Woody in this entry almost like Hanks had stopped caring about the role and/or was given a kind of lousy script. One of the most heartbreaking parts of this entry is that the relationships we really developed in the first two entries were forgotten about. Buzz and Woody had one scene of development together, that's it. I also feel like Buzz got the short end of the stick as far as I feel like they could have written him out of the script and nothing would have been lost as far as the plot is concerned. Jessie (never been my favorite character) also got maybe 2-3 minutes of actual screen time and a sentence or two of script. I can't even remember Bullseye being in the movie. Bonnie's new toys didn't get enough time to actually have much of a personality, the Key and Peele toys weren't that funny (suprisingly) and just cheapened the overall experience. Bo Peep was an annoying character for me. I am all for equality between genders but this just seems so tacked on and politically charged and irked me just like Belle in the live action's Beauty and the Beast or those Frozen girls. She was annoying to watch and had the same personality as every other Disney princess since Disney \"woke.\" The movie's only antagonist's story arch resolved with 20 minutes to go and she was utterly forgettable. Her dummy henchmen are going to be giving my boys nightmares for the rest of their lives and were definitely not something I expected to see in a family movie (and I'm not one to shelter my children from potentially scary scenes, looking at you shark attack in Finding Nemo). I'm surprised how high this has been rated and just don't see it. For me it ranks right around Monster's University on the Pixar lineup with Cars 2 (never saw 3) being one of the few below it. I even liked Finding Dory significantly more than this one and that was the movie that made me realize that Pixar has lost it's magic. If it weren't for Inside Out I probably wouldn't bother seeing any more of Pixar (or Disney for that matter) until they make some big changes.","displayName":"Sean C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1320618012/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-24T06:30:02.876Z","updateDate":"2019-11-24T06:30:11.321Z","user":{"userId":"920673520","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sean C","accountLink":"/user/id/920673520"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 24, 2019"},

Sadly it appears to be the final chapter to the \"Toy Story\" line. Unbelievably great movies! I was a bit dissapointed the original main characters play a minimal role in the plot along with minimal screen time as well. Buzz Lightyear is practically a minor character since his role lacks significance  to the plot tremendously if you compare it to the previous \"toy story's\" and they also make his personality appear dimwitted pretty often which just simply looks not right if you've watched 1 ,2 and 3. Even less importance are Jessie, Bullseye, Slinky,Potato Heads, Rex etc .. shaved a half star for that. Still excellent but it ranks the lowest in the saga to me.

{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"SPOILERS:\nIf I was a feminist I would've loved this movie. Unfortunately I still haven't quite been swayed by the latest feminist agenda popping up in movies and TV in recent years. Toy Story 4 tried hard and there was plenty of good moments and narrative absent of any agenda that made the film enjoyable. But the feminist moments just left a bad taste in my mouth. Woody is demeaned to the point of an \"accessory\" by Bo Peep, and yet we're expected to believe that Woody would love Bo Peep and just leave all his old friends behind who he's been with for all the three previous movies. It almost encourages masochism and low self esteem. It just feels spiteful and wrong. And then the passing of the sheriff's badge from Woody to Jessie just felt like a nod to the passing of the patriarchy to the matriarchy, which, again, if I were a feminist I'd have loved that moment. But to me it feels forced and politically motivated and I prefer art to be honest and reflect reality, rather than try to force fit an agenda onto a narrative in the hopes of recreating reality. It basically turns art into propaganda. But besides those moments, the rest of the movie was pretty good.

{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Toy Story 4 was average at best. As someone whose first ever film was the original story and someone who saw Toy Story 3 in cinemas just before I started university (watching Andy head off for college), I consider myself very much of the Toy Story generation. This film really feels like it's forgotten it's older fans and has moved on to a much younger audience, which is quite sad. It lacked the usual charm of a Pixar movie that sees jokes for both children and adults. Scenes are repetitive and cover a lot of the same information multiple times. \n\nThe toy cast list has almost been tripled and yet next to no time is spent with any character that isn't Woody or Bo. Even staple characters like Buzz and Jessie are very much sidelined. So many characters are introduced and given next to no screen time.\n\nIt's sad to see Toy Story end this way after, what I consider, a perfect ending to their third instalment.","displayName":"Helen N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10208735248593158/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-21T17:31:38.313Z","updateDate":"2019-07-21T17:35:48.394Z","user":{"userId":"975619419","realm":"RT","displayName":"Helen N","accountLink":"/user/id/975619419"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 21, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I'll be honest; when I heard that pixar was making yet another Toy Story Movie, I groaned. I believed that the third installment had a perfect ending and that there wasn't a need for a fourth entry. Boy was I wrong. The movie itself is animated beautifully, everything was crisp and gorgeous to look at. And the story? Well, it's just as amazing as the animation. The movie mostly centers around woody and bo-peep; you don't really get to see the other toys all that much. And to be honest, I'm fine with that. Pixar didn't throw the conclusion of the third movie out, rather, they continued woody's story because his character arc was not yet finished. The other toys... their stories really did end in Toy Story Three, which is why this movie focuses on woody rather than all of the other toys. Overall, I loved this movie and cried my eyes out at the end. This is truly pixar at it's finest.

But with that being said, although it didn't make me cry like 3 did, and it was more of  Woody's adventure, it's still a cute addition and fun adventure.

It was a wonderful experience seeing Woody, Buzz, and company on the big screen together again, but it isn't the best out of the series. I was just 6 years old when the very first one came out and it got me hooked, so this movie definitely brought back a lot of childhood memories but I still keep the original close to my heart.\n\nThe newest homemade toy Forky makes for a great imaginative addition, a lost Bo Peep shines as she takes charge right into the spotlight and Duke Caboom voiced by Keanu Reeves cashes in on the continued Keanu sensation. The movie has some great flashbacks to Andy but it is all about Bonnie. It does a great job sharing similar themes as it's predecessors and it really doesn't hit you hard in the feels until the very end which was a nice way to put an END to the Toy Story we all loved.\n\nI give it 8/10.","displayName":"Sean T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-01T18:14:06.264Z","updateDate":"2019-08-01T23:37:25.008Z","user":{"userId":"978181402","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sean T","accountLink":"/user/id/978181402"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 01, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"You already knew this film was going to rock. It just kept box ticking the whole way through. We get to see Andy again, there's that beautiful transition sequence that Pixar excel at to bring us up to present events and we're back with the gang pretty much where we left off.\n\nSo about half hour in I started to wonder about the old characters, the Potato heads seemed mute (I know Ron died but they said they had his dialogue covered, but 3 lines?) Even Rex was unusually quiet and unpanicked. However the new characters seamlessly replaced them and I wasn't left wondering anymore. I loved the introduction of the little cop and then the inevitable dark side in the form of the ventriloquist dummies and the creepy but pretty little talking doll. The stunt guy was a great addition and each of the new guys played a nice part in the overall story telling, not forgetting the 2 stuffed toys from the shooting range. The little alternate reality scenes with them were a genius idea and added yet another layer to the already bulging amount of depth to this film.\n\nThe animation was on another level and the realism, although held a bit in check I feel so as to not go full on photo realistic was really lovely and made the whole thing sit as a believable film a whole lot more. I loved the way that although there was this dark threat to the film that is was actually done in a really nice way and the threat was neutralised and weaved itself perfectly into the story and the antagonist became the climax of the film. Before I went in I was wondering when they were going to deliver the emotional punch in the guts and as per the previous film it was almost at the end. I thought I could avoid it, not be affected, or just brush it off somehow but damn, those guys did it again and had me crying in the cinema when the little lost girl picked Dolly up and hugged her. Crikey, these guys know how to deliver that so masterfully and pull all of the invested emotion into a simple scene, leaving you brimming with all sorts of feelings and the unstoppable moist eyes.\n\nSo yeah, we went full circle, we learned all about friendships all over again, we had Buzz on another tangent with his inner voice and overall many layers of adult themes crammed into a children's romp. But Pixar know their quarry, these guys are the masters and they can pick and choose the top talent in the world to come and work for them. I noticed the film was directed by an unfamiliar face but clearly the old guard had a huge influence on this movie. I loved it from start to finish, what a feast, what a way to go out, belly laughs, tears and I just can't wait to watch it over and over again like I do with all of Pixar's masterpieces. Simply fantastic!","displayName":"Kenny E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/618506103/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-08-01T15:56:28.163Z","updateDate":"2019-08-01T15:56:28.163Z","user":{"userId":"795420206","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kenny E","accountLink":"/user/id/795420206"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 01, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Widely dubbed as one of cinemas all-time greatest trilogies, Toy Story was an unblemished set of films, never misplacing a step, and while the surprise 4th rendition isn't quite that level of excellence, it's still as charming and heartwarming as ever.\n\nThe gang that we grew to love is still very much together, under their new ‘kid' Bonnie. Woody our ever present source of righteousness finds himself struggling to come to terms with no longer being the beloved favourite. Something's never change though, as Woody remains the kindest and loyalist toy you would ever want. He goes the extra mile to ensure that Bonnie doesn't get down in the dumps with her kindergarten blues. This leads to the introduction of our newest member, the surprising engaging ‘Forky'. Several events follow until we end up riding that old movie trope, The Road Trip. \n\nSlow to get going, the story gets stuck in a loop. It's not till the end where you see the Toy Story you love begin to flourish and blossom, making you feel all those emotions this franchise has made you ever so familiar with. \nRepetition runs rife, woven into the fabric of the narrative. The repetition begins and ends with Forky, the newest member of our toy chest. Suffering from a crisis of identity and belonging Forky seeks refuge in the place he believes he belongs. Thankfully this source of personal irritation is lulled by a tender scene, ran by Woody.\n\nWhile it may start slow, the opening sequence is quintessential Pixar, a delightful recap (that I was more than grateful for), brimming with warmth and emotion, just lovely storytelling. Quickly catching you up on Bo Peep's initial exit, before her return as a kick-ass, wandering renegade, seeking a life of freedom, which opposes the standard Toy life. \n\nAs for the new characters, they're all good, and there's a few I would've liked to see more of - and had their backstory improved upon. Gabby is a refreshing antagonist for a film targeted towards kids. She operates in the grey area of ‘villains', she is without a doubt an intimidating on-screen presence, but the lines are blurred between good and evil, which is pleasing to see. The other side characters are all good, standouts being Duke Caboom and Bunny and Ducky. Ultimately they're sacrificed as Woody takes centre stage. He dominates the screen time, gobbling it all up. \n\nI do feel I should acknowledge that this 4th tale of the toys hits on similar beats covered in the first three tales. There is a distinct similarity in how the plot and character actions are bent to progress the story. At times it may feel contrived, but that feeling will be over-run by sheer nostalgia and joy that will never leave these characters.\n\nIn Toy Story 3 we all felt like the story had ran its course, and finished perfectly, but we were wrong, Toy Story was finished, but Woody's Story still had legs in it yet, and I'm pleased to say that this 4th installment did a wonderful job of telling and closing his arc, that meant so much to so many.\n \nSimply it's Woody's Story not Toy Story.","displayName":"Toby H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-08-03T20:24:02.347Z","updateDate":"2019-08-03T20:24:02.347Z","user":{"userId":"978180166","realm":"RT","displayName":"Toby H","accountLink":"/user/id/978180166"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 03, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"The movie was great, although, I agree, it wasn't needed. Even though the last movie In the franchise wrapped things up perfectly, with Woody and the rest of Andy's toys now belonging to Bonnie, it was nice to see what happened to the toys after the last film. The movie opens up with a flashback to nine years ago, back at Andy's house, where Woody and Bo Peep are being separated as Bo Peep gets sent away due to Molly (Andy's sister) going to college. We then cut back to present day where Bonnie starts her first day at kindergarten and she creates a new toy out of a plastic spork and some crafting materials, which she names her new toy \"Forky\". Forky, who Bonnie takes home, does not believe he is a toy and insists he is \"trash\". It is then that Bonnie and her parents go on a road trip, and Bonnie brings along her toys, including \"Forky\". Forky, still believing he is trash, jumps out of a window and Woody goes to find him. Woody then finds Forky and convinces him he is a toy (or, at least, \"Bonnie's 'trash'\".) Woody and Forky then join back up with the rest of the toys, but not before stumbling upon an old antique store, which Woody thinks Bo Peep is inside. Woody, and, by extension, Forky, then go inside to try and find Bo Peep, but do not find her. Instead, they find a new character named \"Gabby Gabby\" who says she knows Bo Peep and offers to take them to her. It is then that \"Gabby Gabby\" plans to take Woody's \"voice box\" as hers is defective. Woody then bolts out of there, but not before Forky is captured. Woody then wants to head back in and save Forky, knowing that Bonnie needs him, but ends up finding Bo Peep, who is roaming on her own. Woody then tells Bo Peep that he needs to get Forky back from the antique store, where he's being held captive there, but Bo initially refuses, saying she used to be there but was tired of \"sitting on a shelf\", not being bought by someone. They, eventually, end up going to save him. We then cut back to the other toys, who are in the RV, and Buzz is getting worried about Woody for being gone too long. He ends up trying to find him, but gets mistaken for a carnival toy. He tries to break free, but not before meeting two more stuffed carnival toys, being \"Bunny\" and \"Ducky\", who hate him for taking \"top prize\" at the carnival game. He then breaks free and sets off to find Woody, with \"Bunny\" and \"Ducky\" following behind, as they aren't done giving him \"a piece of their mind\". Buzz eventually finds Woody, and, by extension, Bo Peep, with \"Bunny\" and \"Ducky\" catching up to Buzz and beating him up. Woody then promises them he can take them to Bonnie to be played with (spoiler alert: he never does) and they get excited. The team then go out to find Forky, who they do eventually find, but not before Gabby Gabby tries to take Woody's \"voice box\". Woody, begrudgingly, lets her have it if it meant Forky would be set free, and she agrees. Gabby Gabby, with her \"voice box\" fixed, then tries to get a kid to take her home, but, ultimately, gets rejected. Woody then offers to take Gabby Gabby to Bonnie to be played with (which, again, he doesn't do.) Instead, Gabby Gabby sees a lost kid at the carnival and, knowing how she's a \"lost toy\", decides to cheer her up by being taken home by her. Woody then finally meets up with the rest of the toys, Bo Peep and Forky with him, but then decides to stay with Bo Peep as he wants to help other toys get played with. I really am not a fan of this ending. Yes, Woody found his \"true calling\", but he, not to mention \"Bo\" and the other new toys he met along the way, could have easily stayed with Bonnie to be played with, but, I guess \"Pixar\" just wanted another \"feel-good\" ending. Speaking of which, before the movie came out, I initially heard it was gonna be darker and more \"heart-wrenching\" than the last movie, so I went in to this movie expecting a \"tear-jerker\" similar to the \"incinerator\" scene from the last film, but I didn't get that. Yes, it was \"warm-and-fuzzy\", but it didn't \"move\" me. Maybe this is because I'm getting used to these kinds of movies. Overall, the film was good and I highly recommend you check it out.","displayName":"Steven R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000058151899/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-08T19:09:56.260Z","updateDate":"2019-08-08T19:36:57.203Z","user":{"userId":"878631766","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steven R","accountLink":"/user/id/878631766"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 08, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Woody and the gang embark on one last adventure in Toy Story 4.  While on a road trip with her parents Bonnie losses her new favorite toy that she made in preschool and Woody attempts to get him back, and along the way he reunites with Bo Peep, who's joined a traveling carnival.  Most of the original cast returns along with several new additions, including Christina Hendricks, Tony Hale, and Keanu Reeves.  Once again the series takes on some very poignant themes, but it isn't quite as nuanced as in previous films and comes off as kind of talky and heavy handed.  The lack of a strong villain is also problematic.  However, the comedy is incredibly well-done and delivers a lot of laughs.  But it also has a lot of heart.  Though it's not as strong as some of the other entries in the franchise, Toy Story 4 is a fun and heartwarming family film.","displayName":"Dann M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000440772572/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-28T00:36:07.642Z","updateDate":"2019-09-28T00:36:07.642Z","user":{"userId":"906395584","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dann M","accountLink":"/user/id/906395584"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 28, 2019"},

I do agree it is heartwarming and it is beautifully animated but for everything else, I feel it's lacking. I didn't feel entertained throughout the movie.

I feel all the other characters were lacking their normal traits. Even Buzz didn't act like his normal self or even his space ranger self. Barely any of the old characters featured in this film which is what I feel was lacking a lot. It was Bo, Andy and the new characters, that's it.\n\n2 and a half stars from me.

This isn't a \"Andy\" film, this one is focusing on Bonnie growing up with the toys and also showing us that Woody needs to move on from being Andy's favourite toy. Yes this film moves away from focusing on the main set of toys to focus on the brand new set of characters, but that's where the humour comes from and this is definitely the funniest toy story movie and its down to the new characters, the main stand out is Forky, the chemistry with him and Woody is 2 stand out performances inside this film. The main villain, Gabby Gabby is probably the most complex villain in the franchise, but I don't think she is the greatest villain, but still great to watch. Bringing back Bo Peep into the fold really helps to bring Woody's arc to a wonderful and emotional ending. However I do not think this is the most emotional toy story film as that belongs to toy story 3, but it's still emotional to see what happens at the end of the film, especially the final words that Woody and Buzz share together.

Toy Story 4 manages to retain the charm and whimsy of the earlier films and isn't a total soulless cash-grab. I actually liked the themes it explored as well as the new characters - Forky's existential crises and Key/Peele's arguing were both quite enjoyable.

{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"\nAll right, I do it in public so I might as well admit to all: most people who know me know I cry in movies and I have never been ashamed of it but to cry in an animated film??? Come on!! Okay I did and I do. I remember years ago crying when Bambi's mother died but until cartoon movies became way more, in technical ways, I didn't during Snow White, Pinocchio or even Fantasia!\n\nI saw \"Toy Story 1\" but aside from remembering some of the characters I remember little of the story. I skipped 2 & 3 but not having anything else to see today I decided to see the, supposedly, latest and last story. It is a story about how one feels not being wanted or loved anymore and how to handle the feelings and life changes.\n\nIn this film we find an old friend Woody, a sheriff, has lost his first owner, Andy, who pushed him aside when Andy went off to college. Woody found consolation with Bonnie who inherited him but now she is off to kindergarten and has made her own toy, Forky, made from trash items like pipe cleaners, a plastic spoon, doll's eyes and considers himself trash but Bonnie loves him. Very shortly after bringing him home she loses him and Woody feels it is his duty to return Forky, now Bonnie's friend who in turn deserts him while at the same time convince Forky he is not just trash.\n\nThe chase involves some old, and many new characters, in the Toy Story series but bogs down in the chase sequences while at the same time offering a few laughs such as a skunk sort of being a Trojan horse or at least camouflage! The main tug at the emotional strings are the reunion of Bo Peep and Woody with the former having accepted the fact that she no longer serves a purpose just moving here and there.\n\nNot having seen the middle stories I am not sure who is new here but Tom Hanks, as always, is very effective and, yes, believable as Woody. Tony Hale, new as Forky, is funny while Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear gives solid backup to his friends while Annie Potts returns as Bo Peep as a very strong woman and Christina Hendricks as sort of a villainous Gabby Gabby who wants Woody's voice box. One of the newest characters, and definitely the funniest, is Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom, a Canadian stunt motorcyclist, full of himself and daring to do anything.\n\n\"Toy Story 4\" is a film for both children of all ages and adults will, in many cases, enjoy it more! After seeing about a dozen of the 'new' ways films are animated I am still intrigued at how the characters seem alive and, in many cases, you believe in them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","displayName":"Martin D G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-16T22:27:01.677Z","updateDate":"2019-07-16T22:27:14.387Z","user":{"userId":"921106640","realm":"RT","displayName":"Martin D G","accountLink":"/user/id/921106640"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 16, 2019"},

The skunk mobile was super creative and a hilarious way for the toys to move around. Bo Peep was phenomenal, literally the best version of her I think we'll ever see. This was clearly a movie all about woody and I gotta say I am happy for him for what he chose at the end but at the same time I'm upset that they split up the group. I'm also a bit upset that the majority of the older characters didn't get much screen time at all. This movie could easily be setting up new beginnings for a 5th iteration in the franchise. Only time will tell but I'm game to return to these characters again.

{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I was initially sceptical about this film, and knowing what went on in production didn't help, so I went into it expecting to be at least a bit disappointed. Then I came out the cinema with a big smile on my face because I was so happy it was made. The animation is the most beautiful I've ever seen both inside and outside of Pixar, it's emotionally deep and complex with funny moments, heartwarming moments, nostalgia, anger, and the bittersweet ending, and while Toy Story 3 was the perfect ending for the franchise, I consider Toy Story 4 to be the perfect ending for Woody. Seeing all these characters back on the big screen was a delight, and all the new characters are everything between hilarious and terrifying with a fantastic villain that from a film making viewpoint is better than Lotso. The only big issue I have with it is that many of the old characters are put to the side, and I can see lovers of Buzz being extremely disappointed in how the film handled him. Still, it was completely necessary, and I admire Pixar for achieving the impossible.","displayName":"Dominic W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-27T13:34:20.497Z","updateDate":"2019-07-27T13:34:20.497Z","user":{"userId":"978003928","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dominic W","accountLink":"/user/id/978003928"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 27, 2019"},

{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"There is this very irritating feeling when you watch a movie that everyone praised to infinity and beyond, and then you realize that you are among the very few that found it to be not great at all. Toy Story 4 is one such movie for me. Yes, some conversations are pretty good, the photorealistic animation is great and the film has its fine moments for sure, but overall the script is just rehashed in dialogue and themes from all of the previous movies. It's a very lazy, very unnecessary movie given the greatness of ‘Toy Story 3' and its finale. The humor is fine, but rare, and its action/adventure elements are overwhelming and very uninteresting. And I love Pixar to death, but this particular franchise is the most overrated thing they've ever produced, and this film specifically is their worst after ‘Cars 2'. That's why I find it very frustrating when critics show bias toward a certain franchise and heap praise when in reality this is just a weak movie when watched with objective, unbiased eyes.","displayName":"David L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000787676881/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-30T12:42:47.975Z","updateDate":"2019-09-30T12:42:47.975Z","user":{"userId":"901488735","realm":"RT","displayName":"David L","accountLink":"/user/id/901488735"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 30, 2019"},
