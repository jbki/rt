The animation is beautiful and story is fun. Woody is given a chance to evaluate what he needs for himself for once, something only barely touched on in Toy Story 2. Bo returns better than ever, she's really fun to watch in this one. Forky was an interesting concept that really drove the plot. It is sad to see the rest of the toys fade to the background but this movie is for Woody so it makes sense. The villain isn't very compelling, the film probably could have benefitted if she wasn't included.","displayName":"Garrett R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-25T01:55:24.297Z","updateDate":"2019-12-25T01:55:31.203Z","user":{"userId":"978208980","realm":"RT","displayName":"Garrett R","accountLink":"/user/id/978208980"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 25, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Still got it.

This movie was only made to make money. The characters that had been developed throughout the series made decisions that went against their core beliefs. Why would a spork come to life? Why would he get named Forky if he's a spork???? Good casting for Forky which is why they get 1/2 a star. But otherwise, terrible. I would rather watch the My Little Pony Movie.","displayName":"Caleb P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-23T07:30:28.798Z","updateDate":"2019-12-23T07:30:33.923Z","user":{"userId":"975325943","realm":"RT","displayName":"Caleb P","accountLink":"/user/id/975325943"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 23, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great Movie!
