I didn’t think there could be more story to the Toy Story gang. Well I was wrong. Pixar/Disney found a way to have more story. It was a pretty good movie, although the plot was simple. It was nice to see Bo Peep again. The jokes about your inner voice were hilarious. I still think that Toy Story 3 had a better ending. I wish Toy Story 4 had Bo Peep join the Toy Story gang instead of Woody leaving. That didn’t seem like Woody.","displayName":"Kitty","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-17T02:34:45.054Z","updateDate":"2019-08-17T02:34:45.054Z","user":{"userId":"4784440D-4C24-46E9-8A3A-63EC6483A0BF","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kitty","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My grand daughter and I saw it, loved it","displayName":"Loretta S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-17T00:18:20.478Z","updateDate":"2019-08-17T00:18:20.478Z","user":{"userId":"229F2892-244C-4187-A9E9-6B424B863D49","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Loretta S","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was great, but it could have been called \"Woody's Story\".","displayName":"Rich O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-16T23:40:38.356Z","updateDate":"2019-08-16T23:40:38.356Z","user":{"userId":"977851691","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rich O","accountLink":"/user/id/977851691"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 16, 2019"}]}
