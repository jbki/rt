There were many times the movie made the audience cackle while other times we gasped in slight fear. The ending became predictable at a point near the end but for the most part there were still some unexpected turns that'll make your heart melt. The movie overall is precious and entertaining.","displayName":"Devin sternes","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-06T02:48:49.434Z","updateDate":"2019-07-06T02:49:28.915Z","user":{"userId":"0ecca2c7-7bb4-403d-921a-b0b107fd6d9b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Devin sternes","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was fun and funny for both children and parents.
