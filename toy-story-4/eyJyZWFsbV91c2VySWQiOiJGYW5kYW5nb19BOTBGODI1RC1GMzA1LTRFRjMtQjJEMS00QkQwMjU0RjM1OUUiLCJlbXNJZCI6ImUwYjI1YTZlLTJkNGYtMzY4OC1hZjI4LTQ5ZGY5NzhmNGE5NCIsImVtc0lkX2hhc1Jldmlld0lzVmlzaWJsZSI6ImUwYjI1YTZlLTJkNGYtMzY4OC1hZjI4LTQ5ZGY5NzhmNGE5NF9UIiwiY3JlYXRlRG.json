I like that we got to revisit what happened to Bo Peep — and I found the evolution of her character to be intriguing. For me, it really brought the Toy Story franchise full circle — in the first film, Woody is terrified at the prospect of being a lost toy, but in this movie, Bo and some of the others fully embrace it. I thought there were some really funny moments in this movie. It had a lot of heart. They could have ended the Toy Story franchise with Toy Story 3 and that masterful ending. But I’m okay with Pixar making this one.","displayName":"Tim C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-19T22:06:01.475Z","updateDate":"2019-07-19T22:06:01.475Z","user":{"userId":"4F3CE9BE-ED58-436E-BC02-EF5FC6A0B623","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Tim C","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Toy Story 4 is loveable!
