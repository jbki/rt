Then I came out the cinema with a big smile on my face because I was so happy it was made. The animation is the most beautiful I've ever seen both inside and outside of Pixar, it's emotionally deep and complex with funny moments, heartwarming moments, nostalgia, anger, and the bittersweet ending, and while Toy Story 3 was the perfect ending for the franchise, I consider Toy Story 4 to be the perfect ending for Woody. Seeing all these characters back on the big screen was a delight, and all the new characters are everything between hilarious and terrifying with a fantastic villain that from a film making viewpoint is better than Lotso. The only big issue I have with it is that many of the old characters are put to the side, and I can see lovers of Buzz being extremely disappointed in how the film handled him. Still, it was completely necessary, and I admire Pixar for achieving the impossible.","displayName":"Dominic W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-27T13:34:20.497Z","updateDate":"2019-07-27T13:34:20.497Z","user":{"userId":"978003928","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dominic W","accountLink":"/user/id/978003928"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie!
