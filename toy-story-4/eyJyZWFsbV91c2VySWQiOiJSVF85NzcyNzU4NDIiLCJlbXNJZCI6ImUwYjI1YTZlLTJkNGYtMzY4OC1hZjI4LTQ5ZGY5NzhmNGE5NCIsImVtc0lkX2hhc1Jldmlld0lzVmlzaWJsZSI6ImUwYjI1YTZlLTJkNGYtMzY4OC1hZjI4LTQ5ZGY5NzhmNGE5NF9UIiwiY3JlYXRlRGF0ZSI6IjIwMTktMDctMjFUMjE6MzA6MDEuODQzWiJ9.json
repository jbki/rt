It was wonderful! I admit to being a huge Toy Story fan and the overwhelming consensus among the three of us was that this is the best one out of the 4 Toy Stories. It was thoroughly enjoyable without being sticky sweet filled with the usual TS antics, adventure, fun, and gorgeous color. My granddaughter and I both got teary-eyed at the end, but keep in mind that Im an easy cry. Yes, Im a sop - - there are commercials that have brought me to my knees.  Good for children of all ages, including those of us who refuse to grow up all the way. Highly recommended. Stay for the credits.","displayName":"Robin U","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-21T21:03:00.865Z","updateDate":"2019-07-21T21:03:00.865Z","user":{"userId":"6a69cf6b-c0a7-4588-809a-b1d8e52dbe69","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Robin U","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"very like this movie is fany","displayName":"luz","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-21T20:55:21.993Z","updateDate":"2019-07-21T20:55:21.993Z","user":{"userId":"E4D0C172-802C-410C-8DF4-537357ED3F14","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"luz","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it.
