Weve definitely seen some of the tropes before - toys in peril, Woodys obsession with being there for his kid no matter the cost  even when hes being overlooked in favor of another toy. But there are genuine laugh-out-loud and reach-for-tissue moments, and a genuinely surprising ending that felt right. I dont know if its the end of this series, but it feels like a good place to say farewell to the characters.","displayName":"Phillylilypad","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-17T13:37:40.167Z","updateDate":"2019-09-17T13:37:40.167Z","user":{"userId":"7ece94a0-cc31-4f53-9cb7-32775f7d1d77","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Phillylilypad","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This was a obvious money-grabber but a creative,emotional and heartfelt one that justifies the existence of it's fourth chapter of the series.\n","displayName":"Hasindu L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/990333207786117/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-17T10:45:05.116Z","updateDate":"2019-09-17T10:45:05.116Z","user":{"userId":"977172991","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hasindu L","accountLink":"/user/id/977172991"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Forkie was really funny  entertaining at all times.","displayName":"Maria S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-17T04:22:39.332Z","updateDate":"2019-09-17T04:22:39.332Z","user":{"userId":"e53fc86e-cd56-4648-9436-4fb2487c1840","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Maria S","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 17, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"It's Toy Story, how can it not be good?
