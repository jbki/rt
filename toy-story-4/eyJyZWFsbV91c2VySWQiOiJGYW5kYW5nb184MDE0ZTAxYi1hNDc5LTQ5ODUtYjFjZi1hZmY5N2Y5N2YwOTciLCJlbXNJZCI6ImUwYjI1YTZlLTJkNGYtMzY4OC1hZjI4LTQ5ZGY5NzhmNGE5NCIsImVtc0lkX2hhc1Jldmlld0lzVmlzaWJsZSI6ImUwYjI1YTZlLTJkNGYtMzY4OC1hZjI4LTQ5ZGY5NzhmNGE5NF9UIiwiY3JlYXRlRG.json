Woody is trying to reconnect with Bonnie so he follows her to kindergarten and helps her forge a new toy named Forky. Forky wants to return to being trash, but Bonnie adores him so it won't happen on Woody's lovewatch. During Bonnie's family road trip, Forky escapes and Woody goes after him. In pursuit of Forky, he runs into old friend Bo Peep at a carnival. She has lived happily as a lost toy and offers him a new way of seeing the world. Woody questions what he wants as a toy and whether to stay with Bonnie or live with Bo. A whole new set of adventures and new friends await to point the way to Woody in this charming last installment of a long-cherished tale of toys and the children they love. \n\nThis may be Woody's story, but Forky steals the show. Tony Hale is endearingly wacky and weird and provides a surprising amount of the film's heart. Keegan Michael Key and Jordan Peele are really well-cast as Ducky and Bunny. I can't imagine a better comedic duo bringing this pair of bickering carnival prizes to life. Key and Peele are Toy Story 4's secret weapon and the film picks up every time they're cracking jokes together. Keanu Reeves is larger than life as the small but mighty Duke Caboom, who declares himself Canada's greatest stuntman. Reeves adds a self assured confidence and lively energy that makes this character soar.\n\nToy Story 4 has an equally humorous and emotionally meaningful screenplay. The rapid fire pace of the jokes is balanced well with the film's bittersweet moments. We've been following Woody from the very beginning of these films and Toy Story 4 gives his arc a fitting end, while also diving deep into who he is. My only quibble with the screenplay is that, with all these new characters given so much time to shine, I miss having more time with beloved characters from earlier chapters. There's something so moving about the bond between child and toy in the way it's portrayed in this film. Forky is not your typical plaything, but what matters is the joy he brings Bonnie and the lasting impact he'll have on her life, the lasting impact all of these toys will.\n\nI recommend Toy Story 4 for ages 5 to 18. There are doll characters that Woody and Forky meet that are somewhat creepy when introduced. These movies resonate with children who grew up with Woody and the gang and now their children can enjoy these films. If you're a Toy Story fan, you're going to adore this film. Toy Story 4 is a thoroughly entertaining, wholesome adventure and a nice way to cap off this franchise and I give it 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nReviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.
