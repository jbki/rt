Everything about this movie felt off, especially the Gabby Gabby villain who forced Woody to give up his voice box. She harmed someone so she could get her happy ending but we are supposed to sympathize with her?! The whole movie was cynical and sad and the rare laughs, while funny, were just short distractions from a depressing tale.  When we got up to leave my 10 year old said we wasted the day and money.
