While I enjoyed the stronger role for Bo Peep and the message of \"be happy wherever you find yourself/whatever your situation\" - it just did not feel like a Toy Story story. Buzz and Woody's relationship has always been the center point, even when not together, but here, Buzz is really just a side character. That said, it is still a very funny film, but they still should have probably stopped at Toy Story 3.","displayName":"Paul C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-26T14:28:03.446Z","updateDate":"2019-07-26T14:28:03.446Z","user":{"userId":"810528202","realm":"RT","displayName":"Paul C","accountLink":"/user/id/810528202"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 26, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The granddaughter and I loved it.
