It's even truer with kid's movies, which typically run out of new ideas at a disheartening rate. But leave it to Pixar to buck that trend and exceed every expectation. After four movies and twenty four years, Toy story is still fresh as ever, with all the wonder and imagination of the original, coupled with hilarious new characters and compelling new themes.\n\nIf you've seen any of the trailers or posters, then you know Forky, the misshapen, neurotic new toy cobbled together from a spork and a pipe cleaner. This little fellow may be one of Pixar's best ideas in years. He's a hilariously mixed up, frightened little bundle of nerves who thinks he's literally trash. And who keeps throwing himself into the trash with a single-minded determination that only gets funnier with each of the seemingly endless repetitions.\n\nIf you think about it, this may be the first time an essentially suicidal character has been used as a running gag in a kid's movie. This will of course go completely over kids' heads. But for the rest of us, once you get past the morbidity, it's actually kind of heartwarming the lengths that Woody goes to keep Forky where he belongs. Like a veteran crisis councilor, he simply will not give up on the little guy until he realizes that he has a purpose and someone who loves him. If you think about it some more, this could honestly be used a part of a suicide prevention PSA\n\nAlthough Keanu Reeves' screentime as Canadian motorcycle daredevil Duke Kaboom is briefer than the ads might suggest, it's no less awesome or outrageous. And Key and Peel are outstanding as a pair of sassy, street smart fair-prize plushies. Seriously, these guys are little psychopaths. And the new villains are seriously creep-tastic. Like cymbal clanging monkey or Bette Davis level creepy, with deeply disturbing intentions towards our heroes. Which makes the directions the movie ultimately takes them all the more amazing.\n\nI especially loved the new Bo Peep. Not only is her role here far bigger than in past films, but's she's practically a whole new toy. Years of living on her own and caring for other cast-off toys have turned her into a formidably leader and fighter who doesn't need anyone's help, thank you very much. But for the gruff exterior and awesome kung-fu moves, she hasn't forgotten what it means to make a kid smile. This is the kind of feminist role model our kids can use.\n\n\nEach of the past entries, in their own way, dealt with the fear of abandonment, whether by being replaced, wearing out, or simply becoming irrelevant as others move on. Toy Story 3 completed that arc, and brought Woody and Andy's relationship full circle. Which is why many, myself included, were surprised and even a bit wary when yet another installment was announced. It just didn't seem like there was a point in stretching out the franchise. But of course, Pixar found a way.\n\nMoving beyond the themes of the earlier films, this installment is at heart about destiny, purpose, accepting when it's time to move on and start something new. All of these are handled with a degree of subtlety and depth which far surpasses your average kid's movie, but is exactly what we would expect from this studio. Toy Story 3 seemed like the end, and it would have made a perfectly good one. But this feels like the real closure, and the beginning of Woody's happily ever after, even as it hints at the possibility of more adventures to come. This may or may not be the end. But either way, it's another triumph for Pixar, and easily the best kid's movie of the summer.\n","displayName":"William S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T03:58:02.681Z","updateDate":"2019-07-07T04:10:47.630Z","user":{"userId":"905173010","realm":"RT","displayName":"William S","accountLink":"/user/id/905173010"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This helped bring closure to the Toy Story series and was still as exciting as ever....A great time for the whole family!","displayName":"dennisgregovich L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T03:56:27.928Z","updateDate":"2019-07-07T03:56:27.928Z","user":{"userId":"22923fc8-0161-41be-8f8e-b0e91fa2fc0c","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"dennisgregovich L","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Perfect ending to Woody's story\n","displayName":"Scott S","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/110341233602608/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T03:54:21.742Z","updateDate":"2019-07-07T03:54:21.742Z","user":{"userId":"978144105","realm":"RT","displayName":"Scott S","accountLink":"/user/id/978144105"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great story!
