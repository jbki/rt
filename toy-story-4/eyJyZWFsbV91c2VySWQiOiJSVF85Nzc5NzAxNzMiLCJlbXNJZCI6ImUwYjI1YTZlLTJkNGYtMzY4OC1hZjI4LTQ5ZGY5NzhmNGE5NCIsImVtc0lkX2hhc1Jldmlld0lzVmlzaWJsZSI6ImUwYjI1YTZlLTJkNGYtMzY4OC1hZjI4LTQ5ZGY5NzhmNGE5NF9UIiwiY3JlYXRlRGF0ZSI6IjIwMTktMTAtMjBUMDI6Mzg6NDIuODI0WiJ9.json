It is much of what you come to expect, a beautiful story with new characters and tons of humor. The women next to me could stop snorting during the entirety of the film. The animation was top notch, the amount of detail that goes into a single frame was insane. The hairs on the pipe-cleaner arms of Forky took an army in itself.","displayName":"Chris G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100002287813363/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-20T00:51:43.336Z","updateDate":"2019-10-20T00:51:57.993Z","user":{"userId":"936750087","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris G","accountLink":"/user/id/936750087"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"While the storyline is familiar in this style of movie, the animation and colour is breathtaking blurring the lines between animation and reality.

Il film non mi è piaciuto neanche un pò. A parte avere degli enormi problemi di struttura (ma la gente sembra accecata quando vede la scena strappalacrime, e a nessuno frega veramente niente se il film sia valido o meno: basta che faccia scena), però non ho capito l'utilità di slegare i giocattoli dalla loro dipendenza dai bambini. Sono giocattoli.

I'm now in my 30s and this fourth movie I felt showed a lack of empathy for kids whose parents have gone to jail. Why make a joke about a dad going to jail when Disney should know that America incarcerates the most people so a large portion of the young viewers would likely be triggered. Who thought that would be funny? The writing wasn't great with this one. They should have left it at 3 movies.","displayName":"J. L.
