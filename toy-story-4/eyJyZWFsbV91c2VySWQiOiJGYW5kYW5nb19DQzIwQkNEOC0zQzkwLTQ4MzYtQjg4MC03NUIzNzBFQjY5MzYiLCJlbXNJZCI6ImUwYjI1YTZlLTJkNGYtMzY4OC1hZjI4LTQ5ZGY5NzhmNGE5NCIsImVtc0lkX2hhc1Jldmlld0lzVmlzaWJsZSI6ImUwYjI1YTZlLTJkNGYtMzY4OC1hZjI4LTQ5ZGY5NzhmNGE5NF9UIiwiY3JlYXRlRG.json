Toy Story 3 was a spectacular finish to the series. It was painful to sit through this movie because it was almost entirely a re-visit of all the existing characters and many already explored themes. The new bits (a spork and an exploration of what Woody should do in retirement) were a big yawn. Most of the action takes place in an antique shop and on an RV. Are you still awake? The five-year-old in the row behind me kept pleading with her father that it was time to go. I wanted to leave with her and put us both out of our misery.","displayName":"Maura D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-06T21:34:38.003Z","updateDate":"2019-07-06T21:34:38.003Z","user":{"userId":"0106c0f6-c3ac-4aec-9d51-fe715bda324f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Maura D","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Such a good comeback after all these years.

You would think it would be hard to keep matching the natural fun and wonder they struck gold with in the first movie but Pixar went and did it again. Full of laughs for all ages and excitement throughout, Toy Story 4 is a great addition to the franchise. With new characters being introduced, the new adventures continue with the cast you've grown to love. Written and directed beautifully this movie leaves room for wonder while teaching us the value of good old fashioned love and friendship. Heart felt moments mixed with genuine laughs make this a pleasure to sit through and leaves you waiting for yet another classic addition to this already epic story about toys, and trash.
