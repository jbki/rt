I loved this movie from beginning to end. It embraces the true power of friendship and loyalty, and it really brought a tear to my eye when I saw the beautiful animation and reliving nostalgia. The ending is also extremely impactful and meaningful. We all thought toy story 3 was the end, but this ending, I mean come on Pixar, do you really want to make me cry again and again?","displayName":"phil r","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-12T12:36:23.499Z","updateDate":"2019-09-12T12:36:23.499Z","user":{"userId":"978152772","realm":"RT","displayName":"phil r","accountLink":"/user/id/978152772"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Honestly I didn't think they could extend the story line this far, but I took a chance on this movie and I walked out having loved every second of it.

It wasn't. I think if it was something I hadn't grown up with and had Pixar not hyped it up and made it, I would have liked it more. But there just wasn't enough EMOTION. (Franchise spoilers) The first Toy Story, there was that moment when Woody told Buzz he was jealous of him and felt it should have been him strapped to a rocket. The second one had the sadness of Jessie's abandonment. The third one...oh the third one made me cry. But this one? There wasn't enough to make me FEEL. Buzz has a pretty idiotic side plot, Jessie and Andy's original toys are almost never on screen, and Woody and Bo just didn't build it up enough. I kept sitting in the theater and waiting to feel like I was experiencing this film, waiting for Pixar to hit me in the heart, and it didn't happen. Towards the end there was a part where I think I was supposed to cry and I just didn't. It wasn't built up enough. The third one was much better. This is the weakest one in the franchise. Not a horrible movie, but just not up to the standard these movies and Pixar have set.","displayName":"Fantasy F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-10T20:07:39.202Z","updateDate":"2019-09-29T04:02:11.069Z","user":{"userId":"965827173","realm":"RT","displayName":"Fantasy F","accountLink":"/user/id/965827173"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 10, 2019"}]}
