The new characters that were introduced didn't seem forced and brought something new to the franchise, but most of the characters we have come to love were left behind. I would like to have seen Buzz and Jessie play a larger role in the film, but it seems like they were both limited to just a few scenes in favor of Woody and Bo Peep having the max amount of screen time. Even Forky, the central plot point of the film, didn't get enough screen time, so we could see Bo Peep and Woody's relationship be fleshed out on screen. I did love every second of Duck & Bunny's screen time. I laughed every time they were on screen and their characters definitely brought something new to the Toy Story Universe. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but it wasn't what I wanted in a new Toy Story, but I am a 28 year old man looking at the film through nostalgia glasses. I am sure the movie would be greatly appreciated by the target audience.
