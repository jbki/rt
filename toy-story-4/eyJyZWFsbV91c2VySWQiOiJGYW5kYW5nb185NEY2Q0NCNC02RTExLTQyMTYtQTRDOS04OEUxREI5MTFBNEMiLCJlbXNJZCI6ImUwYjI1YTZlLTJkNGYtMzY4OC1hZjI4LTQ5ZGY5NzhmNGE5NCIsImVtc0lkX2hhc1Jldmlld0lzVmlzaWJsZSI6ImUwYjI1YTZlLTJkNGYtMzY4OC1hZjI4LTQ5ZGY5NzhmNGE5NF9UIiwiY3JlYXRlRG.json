Although the plot was nice and overall it was a decent movie on its own, it absolutely does not match the legacy of the previous three movies. They completely abandoned the main aspect of the film and Woody's personality and traits. The ending was disappointing, the brief and not at all sentimental goodbye between Buzz and Woody made me so sad that I wished I could've never seen it and keep the ending of Toy Story 3 in my mind. Toy Story was always about friendship and loyalty, not about love, yet they made it about love and abandoning everything Woody stood for, for a so called \"love\". Andy gave his favorite toy to Bonnie for her to forget him and mistreat him? Sorry, but no. The perfect ending happened and that is the Toy Story 3.","displayName":"Debbie L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-24T22:31:04.502Z","updateDate":"2019-07-24T22:48:38.521Z","user":{"userId":"978170289","realm":"RT","displayName":"Debbie L","accountLink":"/user/id/978170289"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"I thought the ending was cute","displayName":"Rachel","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-24T22:27:29.371Z","updateDate":"2019-07-24T22:27:29.371Z","user":{"userId":"a411fbae-6a54-4cd4-8255-3557824858b1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Rachel","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I liked three duck and the rabbit.","displayName":"wrldtraveler","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-24T22:03:37.320Z","updateDate":"2019-07-24T22:03:37.320Z","user":{"userId":"41B735BB-3C14-4033-A0C8-88C1648C3D2D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"wrldtraveler","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Despite being a great comedic addition to the saga, it hurts the emotional legacy of the original trilogy by not utilizing much of its previos elements.","displayName":"Francisco  B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-24T21:50:37.008Z","updateDate":"2019-07-24T21:50:37.085Z","user":{"userId":"978170253","realm":"RT","displayName":"Francisco  B","accountLink":"/user/id/978170253"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 24, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"unnecessary to the franchise but still a pretty good addition on it's own","displayName":"jdgonzales425yahoocom","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-24T20:38:26.460Z","updateDate":"2019-07-24T20:38:26.460Z","user":{"userId":"0AA41840-0A27-4BCE-94E6-0639DE1DC5FA","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"jdgonzales425yahoocom","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 24, 2019"}]}
