I admit to getting a tear in my eye at the end. One thing I was surprised at...there are a few scenes that are very, very creepy and have unfortunately given both my 4 yr old and 7 yr old nightmares. The scenes were surprisingly scary for kids...along the same creepy lines as Chucky, minus the blood and gore. Otherwise, was really well done.","displayName":"JennW","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-09T00:44:55.828Z","updateDate":"2019-07-09T00:45:43.709Z","user":{"userId":"a80b1308-31f5-47b1-8bc4-e14f3aa5b9d8","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"JennW","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2019"}]}
