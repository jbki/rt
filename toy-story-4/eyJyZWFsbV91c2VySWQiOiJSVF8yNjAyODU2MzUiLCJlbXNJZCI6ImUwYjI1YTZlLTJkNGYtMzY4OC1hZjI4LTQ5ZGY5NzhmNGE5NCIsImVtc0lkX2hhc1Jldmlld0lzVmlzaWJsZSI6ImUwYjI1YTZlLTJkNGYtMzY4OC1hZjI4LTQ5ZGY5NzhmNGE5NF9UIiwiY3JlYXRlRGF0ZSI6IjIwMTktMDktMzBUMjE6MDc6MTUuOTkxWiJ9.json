Toy Story 4 is one such movie for me. Yes, some conversations are pretty good, the photorealistic animation is great and the film has its fine moments for sure, but overall the script is just rehashed in dialogue and themes from all of the previous movies. It's a very lazy, very unnecessary movie given the greatness of ‘Toy Story 3' and its finale. The humor is fine, but rare, and its action/adventure elements are overwhelming and very uninteresting. And I love Pixar to death, but this particular franchise is the most overrated thing they've ever produced, and this film specifically is their worst after ‘Cars 2'. That's why I find it very frustrating when critics show bias toward a certain franchise and heap praise when in reality this is just a weak movie when watched with objective, unbiased eyes.","displayName":"David L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000787676881/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-30T12:42:47.975Z","updateDate":"2019-09-30T12:42:47.975Z","user":{"userId":"901488735","realm":"RT","displayName":"David L","accountLink":"/user/id/901488735"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Should of ended with Toy Story 3","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-30T01:52:45.966Z","updateDate":"2019-09-30T01:54:26.665Z","user":{"userId":"974831785","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/974831785"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 30, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This movie was really good.
