After the way Toy Story 3 ended, I was a little upset to see they were making another film. I left the theater feeling quite a bit different though. This is a gorgeous film, a heartwarming film, and one I will be making multiple trips to the theater to enjoy. You get to enjoy the characters you know and love while also meeting some new vibrant personalities. Forky, played by Tony Hale, is one of the funniest characters I have seen on screen in awhile. You can tell the creators of this movie wanted the legacy of greatness, that goes along with the name Toy Story, to continue.","displayName":"Layton F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-13T01:53:59.958Z","updateDate":"2019-07-13T01:53:59.958Z","user":{"userId":"978058482","realm":"RT","displayName":"Layton F","accountLink":"/user/id/978058482"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great humor for adults and children.

The opening scene was very important to the understanding of Woody's character. The character Forky supports the idea that not only toys come to life. The setting was perfect for colorful shots. The addition of Bo Peep is probably one of the most important characters that Woody meets. Gabby Gabby has an understandable motivation. Overall, Toy Story 4 is another funny, emotional, and memorable Pixar story that will be forever remembered. The Toy Story franchise wouldn't be the same without Toy Story 4. I recommend this movie to anybody who wants to watch a good movie.
