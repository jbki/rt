Buzz was hardly in it and his character was completely changed.  Woody ends up going against everything he's stood for in the first 3 moves.. Peep is a porcelain ninja now.  The rest of the toys are hardly in it.

It was the perfect ending that (seemingly) didn't need to be continued. But You Story 4 gave us not just a great ending for Woody and his gang, but a fantastic ending. It won't pull at your heartstrings like Toy Story 3, but it will make you tear up a bit more often when compared to its predecessor. My main issue is that Buzz is more of a side character now, but other than that, it belongs on the high pedestal that Toy Story 1,2 and 3 stand proudly on.","displayName":"Noah A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-11T01:26:17.088Z","updateDate":"2019-08-11T01:26:17.088Z","user":{"userId":"978173816","realm":"RT","displayName":"Noah A","accountLink":"/user/id/978173816"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Didn't feel it was much for the younger generation but more for those of us that wanted a closing chapter to the Toy Story series.","displayName":"smithc","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-11T01:14:32.439Z","updateDate":"2019-08-11T01:14:32.439Z","user":{"userId":"AF670025-CE4B-49A2-88C8-AFFCA1F1AE65","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"smithc","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Woodie is free but what about buzz","displayName":"Ralphy","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-11T01:06:12.628Z","updateDate":"2019-08-11T01:06:12.628Z","user":{"userId":"52711A6B-E2D7-47EE-BD2F-334A25255EA1","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ralphy","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Hilarious!!
