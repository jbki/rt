I thought 3 was the perfect ending, but now this film justifies its own existence by creating a dichotomy of expanding its own view of a toy's purpose of existence versus the toy's freedom to determine its own future. This film would make a great jumping off point for existential and teleological discussions.\nMy only gripe is that it somehow manages to feel smaller than previous Toy Story films in terms of narrative. It feels like a great epilogue, but I fear if they decide to make a fifth entry, this issue will become more glaring.","displayName":"Ryan  M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-08T19:37:08.039Z","updateDate":"2019-07-08T19:37:08.039Z","user":{"userId":"978146629","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ryan  M","accountLink":"/user/id/978146629"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"it was a great movie","displayName":"great movie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-08T19:35:12.960Z","updateDate":"2019-07-08T19:35:12.960Z","user":{"userId":"66750F00-87ED-4EDB-914A-C0B99CCFCE2D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"great movie","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great story!
