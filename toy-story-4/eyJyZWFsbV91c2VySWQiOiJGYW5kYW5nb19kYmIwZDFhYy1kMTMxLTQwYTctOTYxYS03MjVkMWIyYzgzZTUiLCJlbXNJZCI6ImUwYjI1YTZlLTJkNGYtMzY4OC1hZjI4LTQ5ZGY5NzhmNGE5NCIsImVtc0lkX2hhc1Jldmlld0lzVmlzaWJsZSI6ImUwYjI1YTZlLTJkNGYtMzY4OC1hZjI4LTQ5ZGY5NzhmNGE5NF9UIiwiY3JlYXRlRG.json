Think of what a space shuttle is in comparison to an ox cart. That's how far Toy Story 1 and 4 are apart. While the first one was surely groundbreaking in the way that it was the very first movie completely produced on PCs, this latest edition is a pure work of art. Even the third one was undeniably an animation with quite clear cartoon characteristics. But the fourth one goes actually \"To infinity and beyond\", and really far beyond. Not only the toy characters look real and alive, but everything in the surrounding looks real as well. From a car to a Ferries Wheel, from a simple can to a complete antique shop. It's absolutely unbelievable. Judging from the laughter inside the cinema everybody obviously had a great time (only adults) as the movie isn't only way more advanced technologically, but it's also sweeter, funnier and wittier. 8/10 points.","displayName":"Giorgio G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-11T21:21:25.228Z","updateDate":"2019-07-11T21:21:25.228Z","user":{"userId":"975555794","realm":"RT","displayName":"Giorgio G","accountLink":"/user/id/975555794"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It made this grown adult laugh and feel emotional inside.
