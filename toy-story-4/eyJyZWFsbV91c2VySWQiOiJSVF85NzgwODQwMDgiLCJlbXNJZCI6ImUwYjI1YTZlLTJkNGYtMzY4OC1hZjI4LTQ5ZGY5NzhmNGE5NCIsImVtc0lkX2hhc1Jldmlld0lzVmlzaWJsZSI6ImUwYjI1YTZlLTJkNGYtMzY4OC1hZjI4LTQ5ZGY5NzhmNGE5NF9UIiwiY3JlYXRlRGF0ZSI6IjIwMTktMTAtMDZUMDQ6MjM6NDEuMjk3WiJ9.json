Unfortunately I still haven't quite been swayed by the latest feminist agenda popping up in movies and TV in recent years. Toy Story 4 tried hard and there was plenty of good moments and narrative absent of any agenda that made the film enjoyable. But the feminist moments just left a bad taste in my mouth. Woody is demeaned to the point of an \"accessory\" by Bo Peep, and yet we're expected to believe that Woody would love Bo Peep and just leave all his old friends behind who he's been with for all the three previous movies. It almost encourages masochism and low self esteem. It just feels spiteful and wrong. And then the passing of the sheriff's badge from Woody to Jessie just felt like a nod to the passing of the patriarchy to the matriarchy, which, again, if I were a feminist I'd have loved that moment. But to me it feels forced and politically motivated and I prefer art to be honest and reflect reality, rather than try to force fit an agenda onto a narrative in the hopes of recreating reality. It basically turns art into propaganda. But besides those moments, the rest of the movie was pretty good.
