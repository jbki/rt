We really did enjoy it as much as the last three. It's not often that there's a sequel that gets better with each movie but this one definitely has. Great story even had my eight-year-old grandson it tears at some point. That really tells you that it's a really great movie when it can bring emotions even out of a child.","displayName":"Audrey","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T23:58:04.140Z","updateDate":"2019-07-08T00:02:44.892Z","user":{"userId":"59247ea2-08de-4fad-a8ce-bbe0f334b3f7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Audrey","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"The heartwarming plot fits with the rest of the franchise.
