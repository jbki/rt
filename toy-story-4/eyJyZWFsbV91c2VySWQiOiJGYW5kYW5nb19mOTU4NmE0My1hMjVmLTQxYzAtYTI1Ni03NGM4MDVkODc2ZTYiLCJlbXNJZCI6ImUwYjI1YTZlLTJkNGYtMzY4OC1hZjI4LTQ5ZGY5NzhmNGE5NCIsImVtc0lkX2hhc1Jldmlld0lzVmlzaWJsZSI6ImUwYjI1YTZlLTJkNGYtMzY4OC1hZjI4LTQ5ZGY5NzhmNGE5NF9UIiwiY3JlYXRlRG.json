The setting is a change from what youd think Toy Story movies would be about but is presented well and shows how this movie is its own, while remaining faithful to the lore from previous movies. My only complaint is that the story could have a bit more emotional tension, some emotional points dont feel as resolved or intense as they could have been.","displayName":"Emily W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-12T05:04:51.532Z","updateDate":"2019-08-12T05:04:51.532Z","user":{"userId":"c1aee6bb-e885-4275-93b0-e1963bd95c65","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Emily W","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"At my daughter's request we saw this in the theater the day after her seventh birthday.   There are some really interesting parts to it – the Forky the spork, for example, who doesn't want to be a toy and has a \"death drive\" of throwing himself into the trash; and conversely, the doll Gabby, who feels she can only be a complete toy with a working voicebox, and is willing to hurt others (in particular, Woody) to acquire one.  Toy Story 4 probably features the least interaction with humans, and specifically families, of the entire series, a gap which is partly filled by Woody, who tries to parent Forky, and Bo Peep, who looks after her sheep and other \"independent\" toys.  And in the end, both choose a life together, away from humans, after helping Gabby find a girl for her.  Is this what it looks like when toys grow up themselves, or is it more like retirement?   While neither kiddo is especially into dolls or action figures, this series still retains its charm for them, I think because it captures the mystery of childhood play.  And that can sometimes be violent and unjust, as demonstrated by this film.
