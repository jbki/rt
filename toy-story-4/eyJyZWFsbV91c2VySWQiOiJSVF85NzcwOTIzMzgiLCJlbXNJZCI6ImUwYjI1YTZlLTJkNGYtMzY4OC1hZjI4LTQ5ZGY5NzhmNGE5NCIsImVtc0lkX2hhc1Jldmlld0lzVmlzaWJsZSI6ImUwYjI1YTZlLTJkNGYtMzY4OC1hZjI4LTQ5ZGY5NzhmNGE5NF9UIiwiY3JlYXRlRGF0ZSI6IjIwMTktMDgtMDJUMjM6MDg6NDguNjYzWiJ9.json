I expected the movie to be really bad after the fantastic ending of Toy Story 3, but it didnt suck as bad as i expected. The animation is fantastic, and is almost photorealistic. However, the story felt lazy to me. The themes of the film contradict eachother. Bo Peep says that having no kid is great and that toys without a kid have a certain freedom. After giving woody a speech about this, Bo Peep helps the doll find a child, and claims that that is the better thing. So what is the theme? That a toy should be loyal to a child or that a toy should fuck their child over and be free? Very confusing. The new characters are either really stupid or not funny at all, and the old characters didnt get shit from pixar. They sat in the r.v. and tricked some grown ass men into thinking that the gps was broken. HOWEVER, the ending saved this movie from 2 stars. The ending was emotional due to great performances by Tim Allen and Tom Hanks. In conclusion, this is deffinately what would have happened after Toy Story 3, but it was not needed for the universe. It was basically a fairly well done cash grab.","displayName":"Jacob C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2384130475180635/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-08-02T22:54:45.858Z","updateDate":"2019-08-02T22:54:45.858Z","user":{"userId":"978183313","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jacob C","accountLink":"/user/id/978183313"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Its difficult to say what is wrong with the movie without giving away key information and the plot.

My only gripe with the film is the existence of it. while yes it is a good film, i don't think we really needed it. I felt that the Toy's story concluded at the end of 3. since there is talks to make a 5th installment, I think the plot should be while Woody and Bo are exploring the world, they come across Andy grown up (possibly with a wife, and or child) I feel like that would defiantly be a tear jerker for a lot of people.but    ","displayName":"Octavio G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-02T21:27:19.204Z","updateDate":"2019-08-02T21:27:19.204Z","user":{"userId":"978183211","realm":"RT","displayName":"Octavio G","accountLink":"/user/id/978183211"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"It was good. Nothing more to say really. I was never a big watcher of the original trilogy so I don't have that nostalgic feel that others may have, but it was okay. I'd never rewatch it, but Forky is amazing and as a senior high school student getting ready for college I can totally relate to his sentiment; We are all trash. He is the only reason why this score is moved from \"Meh\" to \"It's Good\". If you're a teenager, watch it for Forky- he's worth it.","displayName":"Cece O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-02T20:50:58.895Z","updateDate":"2019-08-02T20:50:58.895Z","user":{"userId":"978066423","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cece O","accountLink":"/user/id/978066423"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Liked it, but could have had a better ending.","displayName":"Evan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-02T19:45:00.408Z","updateDate":"2019-08-02T19:45:00.408Z","user":{"userId":"42ABF1E4-D320-4C7F-B1BB-3BF5DA9AC482","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Evan","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Hilarious and extremely entertaining ","displayName":"Aaron R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/4035749228738/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-02T19:36:35.528Z","updateDate":"2019-08-02T19:36:35.528Z","user":{"userId":"978183095","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aaron R","accountLink":"/user/id/978183095"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":" Very different from previous Toy Story movies but in a good way.
