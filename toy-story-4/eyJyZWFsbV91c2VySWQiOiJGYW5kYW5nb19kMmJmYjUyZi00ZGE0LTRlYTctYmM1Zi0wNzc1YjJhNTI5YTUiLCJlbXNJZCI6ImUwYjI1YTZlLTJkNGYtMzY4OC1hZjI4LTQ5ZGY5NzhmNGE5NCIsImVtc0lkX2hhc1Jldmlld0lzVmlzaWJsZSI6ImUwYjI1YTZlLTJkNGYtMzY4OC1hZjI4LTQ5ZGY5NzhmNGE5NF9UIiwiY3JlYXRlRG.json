The three other movies were far better. However we do see better animation in this movie. The plot was overshadowed by corny jokes and untimely interferences. The flow was mainly woody jumping out of the rv to save a spork. However it was toy story so I enjoyed it.","displayName":"Aidan B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/841617082891988/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-08T01:16:42.826Z","updateDate":"2019-08-08T01:16:42.826Z","user":{"userId":"978149155","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aidan B","accountLink":"/user/id/978149155"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Clever new story told by favorite old characters.
