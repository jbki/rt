Toy Story has been in my heart for a very long time! I was born to love the Toy Story franchise! I wasn't born before Toy Story (1995) but I was 1 year older than Toy Story 2 (1999)! I love these characters so much! They have been in my heart for a very long time! I was just like Andy growing up. I'd play with my toys constantly every day. and always took care of them! So...Toy Story 4 (2019) This movie was EXCELLENT!! Great story, full of heart and laughter! Woody has always been my favorite deputy for as long as I can remember! And this story is all about the cowboy. It broke me with tons of emotional scenes and heart breaking decisions! I love the new characters they put in this movie too! Ducky and Bunny, Duke Caboom, and Forky! Why I said emotional and heart breaking is because Woody has always been loyal and watching my character grow over the years to now in Toy Story 4 (2019) It was hard for me to watch him make some sacrificing decisions. So this move I'd give it not 5 stars not even 10 stars! I give it 1,000 stars! Such a great film, and definitely worth the money! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!  I'm disappointed for the score on this website. Though it's still pretty high! I don't understand some of you people hating this film! IT WAS ASTOUNDING! PURE PERFECTION!

This film may have single highhandedly annihilated the entire \"Toy Story\" franchise. This movie had more problems than it had main characters (which is a problem within itself). \n\nFirst of all, Buzz Lightyear (my personal favorite toy) was completely clocked by the main story-line. For a charter that was featured so heavily in the first three movies, I was incredibly upset that he seemed to only be a supporting charter. This is just the beginning. \n\nSecondly, toys are NOT made to interact with humans - periodt. Buzz Lightyear (my personal favorite toy) spoke to a human as he was being flinged into the cabinet like Forky tried to fling himself in the trash can (which happened far too many times). \n\nThird, on the subject of Forky, WHY IN THE WORLD is he not called Sporky? He is clearly a spork - as stated many times in the film. Obviously this was a clear oversight of the writers. \n\nFourth, the ventriloquist dolls featured in the film are very frightening - even more so than the Lot's-O'-Huggin' Bear from Toy Story 3. I had a very young boy sitting next to me during the showing, and he jumped and was severely frightened each time they appeared.\n\nFirth of all, Gabby Gabby did not deserve Woody's help. She stole his voice box! I was incredibly disappointed that Gabby Gabby has not thrown in the trash to be compounded. Woody lost his voice box, and it was forgotten by the rest of the toys! This lack of realism is why the Toy Story franchise is failing. \n\nAnd lastly, Woody should not been the only toy to abandon the pack. Woody and Buzz have been together since the first movie, and it was cruel to split them up over another toy. I was deeply saddened by this creative decision from the writers.","displayName":"Hayden V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-11T04:03:43.186Z","updateDate":"2019-07-11T04:04:05.086Z","user":{"userId":"978149626","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hayden V","accountLink":"/user/id/978149626"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Cute story and the animation is unbelievably perfect.","displayName":"Kim","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-11T03:51:02.325Z","updateDate":"2019-07-11T03:51:02.325Z","user":{"userId":"72AAC242-5DC3-4923-B92F-ABD6D09AF9E0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kim","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Awful!
