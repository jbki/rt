Pixar apparently believes that a female character must be a cool, detached action hero in order to be a strong character and removed her soft, sweet, caring attributes which had defined her original incarnation.  The film also undermines the ending of Toy Story 3.  Buzz also has lost several IQ points from previous films for the sake of this unnecessary sequel.  Skip it.","displayName":"Kelsey","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T19:11:12.770Z","updateDate":"2019-07-07T19:11:12.770Z","user":{"userId":"641514D2-A9EA-47EB-B6DB-BD953ADDFC29","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kelsey","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"}]}
