It did not keep my 2 year olds attention and she sat through The Lion King with no problem. I personally was falling asleep on it. It was so boring we left before it was over.

I did not see this coming.  And I also loved that the ventriloquist puppets were the same version of the scary puppet from the Twilight Zone.
