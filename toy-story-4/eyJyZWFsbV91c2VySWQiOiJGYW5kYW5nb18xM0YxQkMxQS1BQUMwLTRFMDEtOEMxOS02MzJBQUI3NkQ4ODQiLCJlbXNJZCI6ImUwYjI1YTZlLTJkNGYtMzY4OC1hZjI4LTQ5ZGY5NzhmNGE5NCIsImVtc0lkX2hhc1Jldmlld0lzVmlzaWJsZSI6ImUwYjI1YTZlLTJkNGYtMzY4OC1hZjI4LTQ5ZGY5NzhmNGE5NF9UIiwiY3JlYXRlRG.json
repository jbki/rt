Good, maybe even better than good, but definitely not epic.","displayName":"P.A.","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-17T18:15:46.121Z","updateDate":"2019-07-17T18:15:46.121Z","user":{"userId":"14BD509B-2F55-48DB-9A49-D74C20F73B35","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"P.A.","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 17, 2019"}]}
