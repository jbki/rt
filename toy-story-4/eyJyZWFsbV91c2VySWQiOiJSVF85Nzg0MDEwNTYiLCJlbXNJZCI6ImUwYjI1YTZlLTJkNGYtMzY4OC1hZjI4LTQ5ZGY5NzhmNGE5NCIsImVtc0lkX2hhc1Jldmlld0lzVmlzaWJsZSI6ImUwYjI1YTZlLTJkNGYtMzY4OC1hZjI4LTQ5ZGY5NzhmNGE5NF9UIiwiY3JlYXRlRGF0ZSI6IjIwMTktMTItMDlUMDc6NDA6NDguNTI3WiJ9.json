Some good humor and a fitting conclusion to the series which made happy and sad all at once. Massively out does the third film and restored my faith. Wasn't a huge fan of the new characters involved but the main new addition has an interesting arch. Overall, would recommend.","displayName":"Logan P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T08:25:47.006Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T08:25:48.623Z","user":{"userId":"978421672","realm":"RT","displayName":"Logan P","accountLink":"/user/id/978421672"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"muito bommmmmmmmmmm, divertido lindo engra√ßado uma historia incrivel","displayName":"ryan m","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-07T05:54:37.653Z","updateDate":"2019-12-07T05:54:39.525Z","user":{"userId":"978421081","realm":"RT","displayName":"ryan m","accountLink":"/user/id/978421081"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Thankfully they recognize that the third one was a pretty definitive endpoint for this series, so this one is left to function as a sort of lengthy epilogue.

The story is known and here Woody is fixing up a lost toy, trying to bring him back to his kid. It's a wild and crazy ride. Many tricky situations that the toy team always comes out from. It's not original, but some solutions seem creative.\n\nThe film looks amazing, but the ride is a bit rushy and there are not many funny moments here. I felt that this was a film that never needed to get made.\n\n5 out of 10 toys.","displayName":"Tor K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10155968065610176/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-04T22:06:34.068Z","updateDate":"2019-12-04T22:06:34.068Z","user":{"userId":"782432537","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tor K","accountLink":"/user/id/782432537"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 04, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Toy Story 4 is exceptional.
