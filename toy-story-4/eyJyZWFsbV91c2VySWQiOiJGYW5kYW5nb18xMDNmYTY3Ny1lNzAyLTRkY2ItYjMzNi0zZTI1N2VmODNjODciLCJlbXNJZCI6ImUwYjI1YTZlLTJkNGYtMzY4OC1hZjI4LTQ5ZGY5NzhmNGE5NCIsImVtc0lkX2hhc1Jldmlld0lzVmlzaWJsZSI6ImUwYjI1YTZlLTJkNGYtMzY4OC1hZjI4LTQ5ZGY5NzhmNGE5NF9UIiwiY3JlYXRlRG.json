The Toy Story saga is arguably Pixar’s crowning achievement in terms of an established animated franchise, and the trilogy ended perfectly. So when a 4th was announced, I was worried it might tarnish the reputation of the trilogy that came before it. What Pixar produced was another classic and possibly the most rewatch-able Toy Story movie to date. After ending Andy’s storyline and opening up this movie it has become evident that all the individual characters still have a story to tell. This movie services as that extra layer of icing on an already delicious cake. There is not nearly the same amount of story to tell as in each of the previous 3 films however. The plot of Toy Story 4 is very simple and straightforward, yet it still works in its own way. The reason it works so well is because it owns its simple story and fills the gaps with some of the funniest moments I can remember in an animated movie, as well as great character moments. The focus here is on Woody, completely closing his wonderful character arc in the best way possible. This is a movie that boasts a dynamic script and character development as opposed to an epic journey, and it’s all the better for it. The choice to do this results in a Toy Story movie that feels unique compared to the others, and is simply the result of a team of people that know exactly what they are doing and how to do it. This film was confidently crafted and achieved exactly what it wanted to and then some. Toy Story 4 concludes the franchise with a bang while standing out from the crowd. It even makes a solid case for being the best Toy Story film to date, but that would be dependent upon what the viewer loves most about these animated movies. I loved every second! 9.5/10","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-10T17:41:42.977Z","updateDate":"2019-07-10T17:41:42.977Z","user":{"userId":"951963967","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/951963967"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best Toy Story movie ","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-10T17:41:09.067Z","updateDate":"2019-07-10T17:41:09.067Z","user":{"userId":"260292957","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260292957"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I loved it.
