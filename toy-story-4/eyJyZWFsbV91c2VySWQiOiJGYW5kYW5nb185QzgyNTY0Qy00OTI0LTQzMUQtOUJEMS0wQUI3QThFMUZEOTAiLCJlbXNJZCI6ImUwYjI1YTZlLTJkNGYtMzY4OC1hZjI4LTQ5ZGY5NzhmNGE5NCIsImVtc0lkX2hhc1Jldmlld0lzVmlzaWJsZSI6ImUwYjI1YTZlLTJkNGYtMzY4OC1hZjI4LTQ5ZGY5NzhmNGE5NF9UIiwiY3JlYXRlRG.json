The ending to Toy Story 3 made sense, Andy grew up and he is not only saying goodbye to his toys he's saying goodbye to his childhood. However, the ending to Toy Story 4, the plot was kinda confusing. I did get a chuckle out of the 'Duke Kaboom' skits and I almost laughed at Forky thinking \"he was Bonnie's trash\". But over all it was incredibly boring.","displayName":"Henry D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-08T02:02:01.336Z","updateDate":"2019-07-08T02:02:10.739Z","user":{"userId":"978145572","realm":"RT","displayName":"Henry D","accountLink":"/user/id/978145572"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1_5","review":"Really disappointing.
