Fun, compelling plot with absolutely gorgeous graphics. Also some great creepy mannequins and a somewhat disturbing doll. Adults will like it as much as kids. Best movie out this year.

Familiar faces and voices that just take you back to happy memories. This was our first movie together as a family with my 3 year old and he enjoyed it up until his nap time with a third of the movie left to go. The movie was certainly entertaining and engaging with friend loyalty ruling the day once more. You just can't beat Woody and Buzz doing what they do best, and they did it well here.","displayName":"Derek K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-15T13:54:00.842Z","updateDate":"2019-07-15T13:54:00.842Z","user":{"userId":"b5ab2542-379d-400e-966c-af517f5bb0f7","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Derek K","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Was entertaining for the whole family made us all laugh","displayName":"Alisha","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-15T13:53:21.515Z","updateDate":"2019-07-15T13:53:21.515Z","user":{"userId":"87c7bb4a-5d0c-4794-8293-fae7299d04cb","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Alisha","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best by far!
