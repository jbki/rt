There are amazing characters, nice story, funny scenes, likely music and emotional atmospheres. Although I think Pixar team could do more and make some scenes even better. I loved this movie and I will rewatch it.

The story continued, but the action was  fresh and funny. As always, Pixar movies appeal as much (or more) to adults as they do for kids. My 18 year old boy, husband and I laughed and cried numerous times. I will have to see it again and again. That says it all.","displayName":"Laura H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T11:47:10.064Z","updateDate":"2019-07-07T11:47:10.064Z","user":{"userId":"209b141d-f4c7-4e79-a626-72f9a1889226","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Laura H","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"}]}
