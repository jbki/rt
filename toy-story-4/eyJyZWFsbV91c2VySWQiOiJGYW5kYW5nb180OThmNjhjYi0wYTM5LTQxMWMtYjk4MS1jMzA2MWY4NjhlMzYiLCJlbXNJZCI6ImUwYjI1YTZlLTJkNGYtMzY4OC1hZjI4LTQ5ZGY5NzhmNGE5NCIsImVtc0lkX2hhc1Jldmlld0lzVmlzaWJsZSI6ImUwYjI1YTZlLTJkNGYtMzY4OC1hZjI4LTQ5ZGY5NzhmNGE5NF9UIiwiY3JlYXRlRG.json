The attention to detail in the film is incredible and it is such a visually beautiful film. However, I do think that the storyline is much slower than the first 3 films, with not much happening until Woody discovers the antique shop halfway through the film. Objectively, the movie was amazing on its own but in regards to the previous 3, it just doesn't stand up. It's fun to watch and I'd recommend it but it really disappointed me as a Toy Story lover since the 3rd film \"ended\" the storyline perfectly, in my opinion. Nonetheless, it was well made, funny, and heartwarming.","displayName":"Sarah C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-13T13:07:18.029Z","updateDate":"2019-07-13T13:07:18.029Z","user":{"userId":"978152952","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sarah C","accountLink":"/user/id/978152952"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Toy Story‚Äôs plot never disappoints, I was as entertained as my niece.","displayName":"Natasha","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-13T12:57:52.082Z","updateDate":"2019-07-13T12:57:52.082Z","user":{"userId":"BE11C663-402C-4146-8027-C89AC69EDE14","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Natasha","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"absolutely amazing üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü","displayName":"Libby G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/120258989249360/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-13T12:51:38.933Z","updateDate":"2019-07-13T12:51:38.933Z","user":{"userId":"978152941","realm":"RT","displayName":"Libby G","accountLink":"/user/id/978152941"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Meh.
