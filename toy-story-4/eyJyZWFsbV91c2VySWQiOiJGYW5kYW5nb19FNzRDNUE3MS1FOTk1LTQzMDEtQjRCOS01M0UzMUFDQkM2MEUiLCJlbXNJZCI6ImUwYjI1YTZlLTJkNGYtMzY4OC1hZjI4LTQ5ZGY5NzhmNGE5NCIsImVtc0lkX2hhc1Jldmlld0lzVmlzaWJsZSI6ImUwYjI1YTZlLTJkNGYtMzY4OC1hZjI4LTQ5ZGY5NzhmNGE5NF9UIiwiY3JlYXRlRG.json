The voices, plot, direction, and execution were great. A lot of the trademark humor as well. My only VERY small complaint is that it felt somewhat like a continuation of the previous film. I would have liked to have seen a completely original plot. But again, it's not necessarily a BAD thing, because it did join the previous movie with it relatively seamlessly! And yes, even though I myself didn't cry, many may definitely need tissues because of the last scene. Minor spoiler: Nobody \"dies\", but there is a very touching and pivotal moment that will probably bring many to tears. Anyway, in a nutshell, a VERY good movie! Highly recommend it.","displayName":"Don Miles","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-29T03:37:49.911Z","updateDate":"2019-07-29T03:37:49.911Z","user":{"userId":"815b9b4a-39a9-4042-b9ab-4f767b9e89ef","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Don Miles","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"If you like the Toy Story series, this one is an absolute hit.

It was really good (Big surprise there *sarcasm*). I was reminded immediately how much I love these characters and this series. The animation in this movie was incredible. The details they put into every little thing is amazing. Just when you think the animation couldn’t get any better, they go ahead and one-up themselves going further and further into the details of everything. This movie was definitely more centered around Woody and BoPeep (and Forky) than any others, which I was fine with, but did have me missing not seeing the other characters quite as much. There were a couple scenes toward the end that got me a little bit teary-eyed, but I still think nothing tops the end of Toy Story 3. That being said, I really enjoyed this movie and think it was a good addition to the series. They could’ve called it quits after Toy Story 3 and I would’ve been happy, but Pixar knows how to handle this series and these characters and  put together a great movie. Toy Story 3 is still my favorite of the series, but Toy Story 4 was really entertaining and addressed some newer themes that kept things feeling fresh and engaging. Go see it if you haven’t! :)","displayName":"Braden Knudsen","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-29T02:22:49.746Z","updateDate":"2019-07-29T02:22:49.746Z","user":{"userId":"417B3837-AF56-4CAC-B587-AEE72657CD6A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Braden Knudsen","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Heart warming and breaking!
