In fact, the only thing I'd say I liked about it was the Duke Kaboom character, the rest of the time I was just bored and almost tempted to walk out.\n\nWhen watching the opening sequence I figured that's what outcome that they were alluding to, and thought to myself, if that's how it ends, I will be very disappointed. Suffice to say, I was indeed disappointed with the ending.\n\nI do not see why it was necessary to have him leave his friends. I do not see why it was necessary to have him give away his voice. I do not see why any of this film was necessary.\n\nI may be a completion, but I definitely will not be buying this disc to add to the set.","displayName":"Sharlene G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-12T01:30:05.785Z","updateDate":"2019-08-12T01:30:05.785Z","user":{"userId":"978195777","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sharlene G","accountLink":"/user/id/978195777"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Kids loved it.
