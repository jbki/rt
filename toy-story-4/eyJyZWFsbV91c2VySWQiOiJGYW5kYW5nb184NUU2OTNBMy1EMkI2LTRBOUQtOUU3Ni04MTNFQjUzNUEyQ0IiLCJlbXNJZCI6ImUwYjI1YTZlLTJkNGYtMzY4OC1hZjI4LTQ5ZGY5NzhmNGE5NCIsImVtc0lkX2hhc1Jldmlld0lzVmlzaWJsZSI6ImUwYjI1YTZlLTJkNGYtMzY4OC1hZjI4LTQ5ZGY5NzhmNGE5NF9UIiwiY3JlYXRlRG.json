I took my 4 yr old, who loves the first three, and he asked to leave halfway through. This hardly felt like a kids movie, despite the rating. The only jokes I laughed at were the ones aimed at adults. Most of the movie took place in an antique shop with creepy dolls, not something that kids will find interesting. They went for emotional impact, but it was recycled from previous movies & added nothing new to the franchise. The other movies had humor and child-friendly action sequences to keep kids entertained in between the emotional scenes, but this one completely missed out. Very little screen time for most of the old characters, some of the characters actually regressed (Buzz, even Woody), new characters were boring/recycled from previous films, and we had no resolution for the initial dilemma (Bonnie scared of Kindergarten). I know the point was Woody letting go, rather than about Bonnie, but it still felt completely against Woody's character to straight up leave his friends and his Kid to live a life on the road. I'm shocked the movie was reviewed so well...I'm usually in agreement with the rottentomatoes consensus, but I can't help but feel let down by this one. Even if the plot & character development was weak, I was at least hoping for an entertaining movie for my 4 yr old. Failed in all categories, except the animation was spectacular like always.","displayName":"Denise J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-05T21:43:28.235Z","updateDate":"2019-07-05T21:46:18.337Z","user":{"userId":"978142060","realm":"RT","displayName":"Denise J","accountLink":"/user/id/978142060"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"cute but not all that funny","displayName":"Thomas","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-05T21:32:30.855Z","updateDate":"2019-07-05T21:32:30.855Z","user":{"userId":"487A3F2F-8D94-4AA9-81C5-DE8DBE5CE706","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Thomas","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 05, 2019"}]}
