The ending was perfectly tied up and I was afraid this would be a stretch. The movie was overall very slow, super dark (most of it was set at night) and just boring to watch. My kids were over it 30 minutes in and it never got better unfortunately. Save your money for something with a captivating story line. Also you hardly even catch a glimpse of any of the loveable characters, you only see the fork and woody 90% of the time.","displayName":"Carrie","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-01T15:15:10.359Z","updateDate":"2019-08-01T15:15:10.359Z","user":{"userId":"E354C4AE-9C2D-4DFB-AD31-B19B9F6DB8F4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Carrie","accountLink":null},"score":1.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Toy Story movies are never bad and they have built something truly special with this series. After what I thought was a perfect ending with Toy Story 3, I was surprised to see a new one. This movie delivers some genuine feels and provided Bo Peep with the character development she always deserved. My only drawback with this movie was I felt it was more Woody's movie and not as much about Buzz or the rest of the gang. Still a good movie but for me not as great at those that came before it.
