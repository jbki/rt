People were VERY skeptical about the fourth installment in the Toy Story saga but after seeing this movie their faith in Pixar can be fully restored. Unlike many other film franchises, Toy Story manages to keep its high standards. A great plot with great voice actors, accompanied by the best animation yet! The film manages to entertain children and adults. \nOverall the film is funny, clever, highly entertaining and very rewarding to returning audiences that have grown up watching its prequels.
