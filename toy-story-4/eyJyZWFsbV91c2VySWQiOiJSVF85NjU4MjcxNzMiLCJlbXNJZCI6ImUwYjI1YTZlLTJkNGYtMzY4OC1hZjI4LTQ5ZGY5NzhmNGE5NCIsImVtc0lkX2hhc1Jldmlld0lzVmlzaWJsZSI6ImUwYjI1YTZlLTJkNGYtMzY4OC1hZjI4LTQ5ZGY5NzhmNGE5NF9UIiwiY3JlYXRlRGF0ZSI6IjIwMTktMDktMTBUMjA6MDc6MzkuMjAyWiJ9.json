Weak story and I felt it was too scary and wierd at times (watched it with my 3yr old daughter). She loves the previous movies but she didn't enjoy this one. Also, the characters felt different. Especially Buzz who appeared to be an empty shell of his former self.\n\nPrevious movies had good jokes and witty lines but this one was just off. Really disappointed.\n\n","displayName":"Agaton D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10158905898218378/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-08T09:41:33.445Z","updateDate":"2019-09-08T09:41:33.445Z","user":{"userId":"978251530","realm":"RT","displayName":"Agaton D","accountLink":"/user/id/978251530"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Liked the movie.
