That being said every Toy Story film up to this point has been a complete masterpiece of cinema deserving of 5 stars OR MORE.

These characters that you've grown up loving have no problem investing you in a very emotionally complex story that is important to communicate to an audience of any age.","displayName":"Alexander N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-09-15T23:22:56.423Z","updateDate":"2019-09-15T23:22:56.423Z","user":{"userId":"973724932","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alexander N","accountLink":"/user/id/973724932"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 15, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie is amazing!

Toy Story 3 ended the story perfectly, what more could be done with it? Not to mention that it's a Pixar sequel made in the 2010s, which don't exactly have a great reputation. Toy Story 3 was great, Cars 2 was bad, Monsters University was okay, Finding Dory was good but forgettable (no pun intended), Cars 3 was okay and Incredibles 2 was a lot of fun but not as memorable as the first movie. It didn't help that none of the Toy Story 4 trailers impressed me. I walked into this movie cautiously optimistic. I hoped it would be at least as good as Incredibles 2 but I was ready for the possibility of a disappointment. However, after seeing the movie, I can confidently say that they did it again. They made another great Toy Story movie. It has an engaging and emotional story, a lovable and memorable cast of characters, interesting themes and ideas, the most beautiful animation that Pixar has put to screen yet, pitch-perfect voice acting, and really great action and comedy! While Toy Story 3 was the perfect ending, I think Toy Story 4 is a great epilogue. This is probably where the story would go next, whether you like it or not. I do have some criticisms though. Some of the writing and comedic timing felt surprisingly clunky and off a couple of times and the ending does feel a little rushed. The ending of Toy Story 3 was definitely a better finale to the series as a whole, it was more epic and larger in scale, but this is more of a finale to the arcs of the main characters. I can't think of a more fitting way to end both this story and the 2010s decade of Pixar movies. It came in with a Toy Story movie and it went out with a Toy Story movie, and it looks like this is the last Pixar sequel we're going to see for a long time. It's been confirmed that there are no sequels coming out for the foreseeable future and they will be putting their focus on original films only. That sounds good to me! Overall, this is a must-see for any fan of the Toy Story movies. It just might be another instant classic. Highly recommended.","displayName":"Aidan Z","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/937912853232351/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-15T19:07:05.702Z","updateDate":"2019-09-15T19:07:05.702Z","user":{"userId":"978267048","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aidan Z","accountLink":"/user/id/978267048"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 15, 2019"}]}
