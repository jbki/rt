The story of this film shows that maybe Andy and the other toys arc had come to a close but Woody's had not. This film it has Woody and Bo go on bold new adventures. Gabby Gabby as the villain had believable motivations and an emotional close to her arc. The end of Toy Story 4 was very well done emotional and satisfactory l. I would be open to see these characters again but they do not return I would be okay with that.
