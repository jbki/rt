Now to get into the real stuff; I loved Woody, forky, and Gabby. Also Gabby was not an annoying twist villain. But this movie was overrated and underwhelming in my opinion. The only really funny parts were the Plush Rush which was hilarious. The main issue with this movie was the fact there wasn't enough buzz, Jesse etc. These characters are so important so without them this movie feels like something big is missing.\n\nTLDR: Good but was missing some parts\n\nAlso this is basically an add on to 3 and I think they should've just added woodys ending into 3 because this doesn't feel needed in my opi","displayName":"Zach M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-27T20:12:59.585Z","updateDate":"2019-07-27T20:12:59.585Z","user":{"userId":"978027903","realm":"RT","displayName":"Zach M","accountLink":"/user/id/978027903"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 27, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Toy Story IV is a great addition to the Toy Story Series.
