Im used to a good amount of humor throughout the toy story movies, but this one was a little too sad throughout. Dont get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE the message that it sends to not judge a book by its cover. The main villain of the movie has a reason for the way that they are and despite their evil, woody helps them. I love that. It will hopefully teach people to look to infinity and beyond the surface....allowing you to get to know someone that is acting mean or like a bully. You never know what youll learn and how everyone has the power to help someone, who may just be acting out because theyre in pain.  \n\nBTW, stay for the credits!","displayName":"Holly N","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-29T10:12:00.738Z","updateDate":"2019-07-29T10:12:00.738Z","user":{"userId":"4bed1759-512e-4e23-9dfe-fac20416ae18","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Holly N","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I took my niece to the movies & it kept us both interested from start to finish.
