It looks like a cash grab, and for all intents and purposes it really is, but never has there been a more heartfelt cash grab than Toy Story 4.  It's not the best of the series, maybe not even better than any of the original 3, but it lives up to the name.  It brings back characters missing from other films, introduces new characters flawlessly, and balances the emotion and fun into a thrill ride that will please old and new fans alike.
