With beautiful animation, and a heart for its characters, kids and adults will love this film. Woody and Buzz are off an another adventure with Bonnie, and her new friend Forky. Forky is such a funny and lovable character, and his existential crisis is a very relatable feeling. Not knowing your purpose in life can be hard, and Forky is forced to grow up and abandon his love of trash cans. Bo Peep is also back with her lovable sheep trio. The ending is beautiful and bittersweet. It's a must see for sure.","displayName":"Dan F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-11T16:30:12.669Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T16:30:15.117Z","user":{"userId":"978426940","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dan F","accountLink":"/user/id/978426940"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"useing fandom to make money,totally unnessary film of 2019","displayName":"Tony J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-11T16:29:45.236Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T16:29:45.236Z","user":{"userId":"976123937","realm":"RT","displayName":"Tony J","accountLink":"/user/id/976123937"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Another perfect toy story film and my second favorite in the franchise.","displayName":"Jessica B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-11T15:55:39.578Z","updateDate":"2019-12-11T15:55:39.578Z","user":{"userId":"978375614","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jessica B","accountLink":"/user/id/978375614"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 11, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"A film that seemed unnecessary but proved its worth.
