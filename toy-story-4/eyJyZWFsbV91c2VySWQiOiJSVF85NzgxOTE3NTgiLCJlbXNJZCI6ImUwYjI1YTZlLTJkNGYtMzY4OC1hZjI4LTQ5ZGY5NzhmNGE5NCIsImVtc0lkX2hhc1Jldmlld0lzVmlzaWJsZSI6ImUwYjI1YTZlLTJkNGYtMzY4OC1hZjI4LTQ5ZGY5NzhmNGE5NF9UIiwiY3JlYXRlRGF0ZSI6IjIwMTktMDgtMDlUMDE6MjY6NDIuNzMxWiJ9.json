Even though the last movie In the franchise wrapped things up perfectly, with Woody and the rest of Andy's toys now belonging to Bonnie, it was nice to see what happened to the toys after the last film. The movie opens up with a flashback to nine years ago, back at Andy's house, where Woody and Bo Peep are being separated as Bo Peep gets sent away due to Molly (Andy's sister) going to college. We then cut back to present day where Bonnie starts her first day at kindergarten and she creates a new toy out of a plastic spork and some crafting materials, which she names her new toy \"Forky\". Forky, who Bonnie takes home, does not believe he is a toy and insists he is \"trash\". It is then that Bonnie and her parents go on a road trip, and Bonnie brings along her toys, including \"Forky\". Forky, still believing he is trash, jumps out of a window and Woody goes to find him. Woody then finds Forky and convinces him he is a toy (or, at least, \"Bonnie's 'trash'\".) Woody and Forky then join back up with the rest of the toys, but not before stumbling upon an old antique store, which Woody thinks Bo Peep is inside. Woody, and, by extension, Forky, then go inside to try and find Bo Peep, but do not find her. Instead, they find a new character named \"Gabby Gabby\" who says she knows Bo Peep and offers to take them to her. It is then that \"Gabby Gabby\" plans to take Woody's \"voice box\" as hers is defective. Woody then bolts out of there, but not before Forky is captured. Woody then wants to head back in and save Forky, knowing that Bonnie needs him, but ends up finding Bo Peep, who is roaming on her own. Woody then tells Bo Peep that he needs to get Forky back from the antique store, where he's being held captive there, but Bo initially refuses, saying she used to be there but was tired of \"sitting on a shelf\", not being bought by someone. They, eventually, end up going to save him. We then cut back to the other toys, who are in the RV, and Buzz is getting worried about Woody for being gone too long. He ends up trying to find him, but gets mistaken for a carnival toy. He tries to break free, but not before meeting two more stuffed carnival toys, being \"Bunny\" and \"Ducky\", who hate him for taking \"top prize\" at the carnival game. He then breaks free and sets off to find Woody, with \"Bunny\" and \"Ducky\" following behind, as they aren't done giving him \"a piece of their mind\". Buzz eventually finds Woody, and, by extension, Bo Peep, with \"Bunny\" and \"Ducky\" catching up to Buzz and beating him up. Woody then promises them he can take them to Bonnie to be played with (spoiler alert: he never does) and they get excited. The team then go out to find Forky, who they do eventually find, but not before Gabby Gabby tries to take Woody's \"voice box\". Woody, begrudgingly, lets her have it if it meant Forky would be set free, and she agrees. Gabby Gabby, with her \"voice box\" fixed, then tries to get a kid to take her home, but, ultimately, gets rejected. Woody then offers to take Gabby Gabby to Bonnie to be played with (which, again, he doesn't do.) Instead, Gabby Gabby sees a lost kid at the carnival and, knowing how she's a \"lost toy\", decides to cheer her up by being taken home by her. Woody then finally meets up with the rest of the toys, Bo Peep and Forky with him, but then decides to stay with Bo Peep as he wants to help other toys get played with. I really am not a fan of this ending. Yes, Woody found his \"true calling\", but he, not to mention \"Bo\" and the other new toys he met along the way, could have easily stayed with Bonnie to be played with, but, I guess \"Pixar\" just wanted another \"feel-good\" ending. Speaking of which, before the movie came out, I initially heard it was gonna be darker and more \"heart-wrenching\" than the last movie, so I went in to this movie expecting a \"tear-jerker\" similar to the \"incinerator\" scene from the last film, but I didn't get that. Yes, it was \"warm-and-fuzzy\", but it didn't \"move\" me. Maybe this is because I'm getting used to these kinds of movies. Overall, the film was good and I highly recommend you check it out.","displayName":"Steven R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000058151899/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":true,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-08T19:09:56.260Z","updateDate":"2019-08-08T19:36:57.203Z","user":{"userId":"878631766","realm":"RT","displayName":"Steven R","accountLink":"/user/id/878631766"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Love the movie, very inspiring that people change my daughter loved it","displayName":"Marco","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-08T17:48:26.541Z","updateDate":"2019-08-08T17:48:26.541Z","user":{"userId":"f8635499-f8f6-4d58-9c39-6fca88767e2a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Marco","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My 5 years old daughter love this movie, she wants to watch over and over again, so I love it to, great to share time with the little ones.","displayName":"Ana","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-08T17:20:45.723Z","updateDate":"2019-08-08T17:20:45.723Z","user":{"userId":"B7730B50-C122-4733-8583-38949A41F42B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ana","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 08, 2019"}]}
