I mean, I am a 22 year old man at this point but that shouldn't really matter.\nThe previous movies have character and a plot that makes sense. This movie was just all over the place. We can start with the pacing, it was all over the place. The movie went from a slow moving plot to a montage in moments. It didn't feel coherent at all.\nThe characters that we have gotten to know through three whole movies where no where to be seen. I mean we barely got any time with Buzz Lightyear or Jessie or any of the rest of the gang.\nInstead we got a story about Woody still being sour about not being the favorite toy anymore (the plot of the first Toy Story anyone?) and how he finds his purpose in getting his kid to be happy behind the scenes.\nAnd the ending, I mean in what world would Woody leave the gang after 20+ years together just to be with one other toy? The whole plot of the other movies are that what matters most is friendship and being loyal? What happened to that.\nNonsensical plot, weird pacing and most of all it destroyed the great story that the three previous movies had built up over the course of two decades.","displayName":"Konrad J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T21:37:16.597Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T21:37:18.273Z","user":{"userId":"978184960","realm":"RT","displayName":"Konrad J","accountLink":"/user/id/978184960"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Toy Story 4 is an unnecessary but, surprisingly good addition to this magical saga. It's fun and heartwarming in spite of overreliance on new characters at the expense of the secondary characters from the previous films. I would be willing to see some spinoffs, but I sincerely hope that they will let this series rest in it's greatness.","displayName":"Louis-Charles P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1569079019802551/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T21:07:36.085Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T21:07:36.085Z","user":{"userId":"977031574","realm":"RT","displayName":"Louis-Charles P","accountLink":"/user/id/977031574"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"4d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"One of the best Toy Story movies","displayName":"Michele L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1051963866/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T06:16:01.198Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T06:16:07.161Z","user":{"userId":"857486017","realm":"RT","displayName":"Michele L","accountLink":"/user/id/857486017"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"Just watched TS4. Huge fan of 1, 2, & 3. Was shocked and disappointed in what they did to Woody and Bo Peep. Disney has failed. This is their M.O. now that we can expect from them going forward. So we have to stop giving them our money. Stop going to the movies, stop buying the toys, stop taking the kids to DL or WDW, stop supporting anything Disney so they start listening. Walt would be ashamed and so are we. Only gave 1 star for the graphics.","displayName":"Jesse","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-30T04:45:24.389Z","updateDate":"2019-12-30T04:45:24.389Z","user":{"userId":"69378E0B-0124-4B73-833C-6686140C97D5","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jesse","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"5d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It shows the true powers of Pixar's animation that goes beyond beautiful but storywise is a sad and bitter ending, Toy Story 3 was better and the greatest end for a trilogy ever, there was no need to open the wound and bring these characters together only to break them apart.","displayName":"Mario P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/755700116/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T02:48:17.739Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T02:48:17.739Z","user":{"userId":"803821811","realm":"RT","displayName":"Mario P","accountLink":"/user/id/803821811"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Formulaic and serious at times but mostly fun.","displayName":"Madhan B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2015984538682048/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-29T02:47:15.436Z","updateDate":"2019-12-29T02:47:15.436Z","user":{"userId":"976944422","realm":"RT","displayName":"Madhan B","accountLink":"/user/id/976944422"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"A gem of a movie.
