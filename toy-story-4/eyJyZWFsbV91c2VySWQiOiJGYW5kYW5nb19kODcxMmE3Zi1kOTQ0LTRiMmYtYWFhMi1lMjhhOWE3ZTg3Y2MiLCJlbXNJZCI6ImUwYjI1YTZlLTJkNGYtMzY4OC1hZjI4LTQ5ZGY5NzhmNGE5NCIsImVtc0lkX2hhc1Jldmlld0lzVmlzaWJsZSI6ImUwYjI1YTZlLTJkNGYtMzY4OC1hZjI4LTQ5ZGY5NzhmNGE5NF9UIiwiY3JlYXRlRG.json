What I didn't like is that Woody and Buzz didn't have enough scenes together.  The relationship between Woody and Buzz was the best thing about Toy Story, but in this version, Woody takes the lead all the way.  It's Woody, Woody, Woody. The plot was shallow and not well thought out.  The storyline between Bopeep and Woody being a thing never happened.  For them to go off into the sunset together, first you have to develop the love story.  How do toys fall in love? Date? Where was the moment where they both knew they were in love?  There was no first kiss.  There was potential there to develop a great storyline, but the creative genius must've fizzled out. It seemed shallow on so many levels.  The ventriloquist dolls seemed to introduce a level of horror.  I liked the new toys and how they were introduced into the picture.","displayName":"Alexandra","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-13T05:50:23.787Z","updateDate":"2019-07-13T05:50:23.787Z","user":{"userId":"4a0b0f28-6035-4cf4-b9ef-6d7054df182a","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Alexandra","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"It is very different from the others and a little dark","displayName":"Mikell","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-13T05:43:59.141Z","updateDate":"2019-07-13T05:43:59.141Z","user":{"userId":"f27ade1f-fbba-4a3a-81fe-9e146a19b9a3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mikell","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Its very sweet!
