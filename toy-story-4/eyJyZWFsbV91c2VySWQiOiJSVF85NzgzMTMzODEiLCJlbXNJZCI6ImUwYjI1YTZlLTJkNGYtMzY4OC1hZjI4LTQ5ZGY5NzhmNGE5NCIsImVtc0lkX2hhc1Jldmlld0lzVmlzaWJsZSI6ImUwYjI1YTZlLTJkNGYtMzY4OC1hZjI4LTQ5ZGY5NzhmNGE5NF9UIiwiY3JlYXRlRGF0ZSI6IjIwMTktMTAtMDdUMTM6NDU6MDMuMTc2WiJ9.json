If they told me this was the end of the Toy Story franchise,I would be bummed it didnâ€™t end after 3. The third one is like Endgame. The 4th one is like Infinity War. In the sense that one is more of a conclusion to the movie and the other the epic finale to a story.

I thought it was good, and I think it doesn't at all \"undo\" the perfect ending that the third entry gave us, which was a legitimate fear some people had. What I will say however, is that I don't understand just how much most people seem to have loved it. I have seen multiple people say it's the best of the four, and I more think it's the... worst. That's not a knock! This is a seriously good series (and also I think it might actually be either better than or maybe as good Toy Story 2). But I am not quite feeling the overwhelming positivity that it has garnered from a lot of my peers.","displayName":"Gimly M","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-07T04:19:19.432Z","updateDate":"2019-10-07T04:19:19.432Z","user":{"userId":"861960467","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gimly M","accountLink":"/user/id/861960467"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"The movie hit every aspect perfectly.\n","displayName":"Alexander W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-07T04:09:26.199Z","updateDate":"2019-10-07T04:09:26.304Z","user":{"userId":"978312208","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alexander W","accountLink":"/user/id/978312208"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"A fantastic installment to the toy story franchise, this movie is a entertaining family movie that will make you laugh and cry.
