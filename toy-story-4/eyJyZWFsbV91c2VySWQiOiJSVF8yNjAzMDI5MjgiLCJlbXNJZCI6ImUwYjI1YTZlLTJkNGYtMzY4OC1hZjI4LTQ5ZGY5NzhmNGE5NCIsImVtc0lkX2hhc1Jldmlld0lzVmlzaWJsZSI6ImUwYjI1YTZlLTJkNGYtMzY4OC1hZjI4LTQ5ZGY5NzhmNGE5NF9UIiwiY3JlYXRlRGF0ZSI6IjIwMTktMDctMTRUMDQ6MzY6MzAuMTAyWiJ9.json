However I honestly wasn't planning on seeing this movie because I hate to see such a great series being farmed for money by a heartless corporation.\n\nI have very mixed feelings about how great this movie was. On the one hand I am sad because it means the movie will be followed by another and another until they inevitably run the series into the ground. On the other hand it brought up a lot of emotions seeing these characters facing new challenges together and striving to overcome. I'm not sure if I will ever own this one in my personal library but it reminded me of how great the original trilogy is. \n\nAlso, Tony Hale and Keanu were great.","displayName":"William C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-14T04:19:39.971Z","updateDate":"2019-07-14T04:19:39.971Z","user":{"userId":"978067979","realm":"RT","displayName":"William C","accountLink":"/user/id/978067979"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 14, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I laughed and cried mor then once .
