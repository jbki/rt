I grew up watching reruns of the earlier Toy Story movies, and the ending for the third movie was very satisfying to me. Until I watched the fourth installment, and I fell in love with the whole franchise again. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this film from beginning to end -- I was a mix of emotions. Props to Pixar for creating Gabby Gabby, a villain that actually has character to her. Someone that you can sympathize with, and understand why she acted the way she did. I also really liked the newer characters. They're all very diverse. \n\nCons, is the heavily lack of screen time for the original characters. I barely noticed the older classics like Hamm, Mr potato head, Bullseye the first time I watched the movie. Even Jessie didn't have much of a spotlight. \n\nAll in all, I really like the fourth installment. And honestly, i'm secretly hoping for a fifth in the next decade or so. I usually don't enjoy films or shows that have more than two or three parts to them, but Toy Story 4 was really, really good. \n\nAnd even if a Fifth movie isn't coming anytime soon, i'd love more shorter films like The Toy Story of Terror, Hawaiian Vacation and more. Hopefully showcasing how Buzz and the gang has been doing, or how Woody has been holding up at the carnival.
