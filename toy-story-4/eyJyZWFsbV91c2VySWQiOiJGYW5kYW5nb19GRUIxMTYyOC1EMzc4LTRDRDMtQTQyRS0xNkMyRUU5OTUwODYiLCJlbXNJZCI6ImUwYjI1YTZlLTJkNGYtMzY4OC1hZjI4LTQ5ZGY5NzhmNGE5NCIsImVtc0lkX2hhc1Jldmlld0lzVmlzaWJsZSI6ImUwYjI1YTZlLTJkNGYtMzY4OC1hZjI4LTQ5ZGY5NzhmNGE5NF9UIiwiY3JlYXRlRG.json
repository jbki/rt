Like each of the previous sequels, I went in wondering whether they were going to the well one too many times, but once again they manage to tell a fresh new story - exploring new ideas around what it means to be a toy (and by proxy, what it means to be human).  Love, love, love this movie, and is an absolute must see for any fan of quality animated films.","displayName":"Danny P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-31T23:22:50.502Z","updateDate":"2019-08-31T23:22:50.502Z","user":{"userId":"976510368","realm":"RT","displayName":"Danny P","accountLink":"/user/id/976510368"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 31, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Prob my fav of all the Toy Storys.","displayName":"Jonathan L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-31T23:18:39.504Z","updateDate":"2019-08-31T23:18:39.504Z","user":{"userId":"bcd5930c-0dc3-408b-9ed6-c2b24547785b","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Jonathan L","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 31, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The movie was great and family friendly.

Packed with plenty of colourful characters, hilarious laughs and terrific performances from an A-list cast, the film delivers everything that fans could have hoped for. At a first glance, extending the series may have seemed like an impossible feat. However, director Josh Cooley has pulled it off seamlessly. Not only does \"Toy Story 4\" bring back the beloved toys we've grown to adore, but it also introduces fresh faces into the cast. Forky, for instance, is the funniest character and a standout in the new additions to the cast. Although \"Toy Story 4\" offers fun family entertainment, it is not a film without flaws. At times, it feels slightly rushed and doesn't give all the characters a chance to shine. Due to its rushed pacing, it isn't quite on par with its predecessors in terms of quality. Nevertheless, fans of the franchise will definitely enjoy \"Toy Story 4\" and so will movie-goers seeking family-friendly entertainment this summer season. If this truly is the last time we see Woody and his friends on the big-screen, its a fitting farewell to the toys we've grown to love and adore.","displayName":"Hassan I","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1451588882/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-31T22:43:58.873Z","updateDate":"2019-09-01T21:23:26.862Z","user":{"userId":"911164540","realm":"RT","displayName":"Hassan I","accountLink":"/user/id/911164540"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 31, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"What else can I say, the end crowns the work.
