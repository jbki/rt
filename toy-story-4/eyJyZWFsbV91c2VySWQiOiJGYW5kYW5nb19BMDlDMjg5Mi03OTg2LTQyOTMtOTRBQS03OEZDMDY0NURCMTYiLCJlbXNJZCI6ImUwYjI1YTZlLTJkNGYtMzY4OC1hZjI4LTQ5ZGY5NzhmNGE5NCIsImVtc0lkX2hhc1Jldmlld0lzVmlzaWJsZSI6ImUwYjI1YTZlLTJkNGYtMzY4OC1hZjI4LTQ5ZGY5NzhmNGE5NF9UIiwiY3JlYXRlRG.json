Most of this movie was a mistake. I am only giving it a half of a star because the animation was sleek and clean. But the plot, oh god the plot was a piece of garbage. It is clearly established over the other three movies that the toy gang is tight. It is the entire PREMISE of these movies in fact. But of course, the lovey dovey romance of Bo Peep and Woody had to ruin it. It was unbelievable. In the first movie, yes, he liked her, and the sexual tension was clear, but there was no way he would jeopardize the relationship of his air tight group and Andy over it. And then, in the second movie, he has some tension with Jesse. This was actually nice, because it helped give Woody a reason to be conflicted over wanting to leave his group, or be put and honored in a museum. But nope. The tension of that movie did not follow through whatsoever. Toy story 3 was the best movie by far, because it had an amazing script that left me crying, and two THERE WAS NO ROMANCE. (I do not count the romance between Jesse and Buzz because it didn't directly influence the plot). But of course, all good things must come to an end. And I was convinced that the ending in Toy Story 3 was the finale, which was a good one to be honest. But of course, the franchise wanted more money. They ended up changing the characters just in the pursuit of more moolah. In Toy Story 4, most of the group, all of the wacky and mischievous characters that complimented each other end up sitting in a van for all of the movie. It was heart wrenching. Not cool, Pixar. And trying to scare all of the young impressionable children in the audience? That was awful! And the characters, Jesus, the characters! There are so many I barely remember their names! I pretty much only remember the gang! They are only used when the plot needs them! Or for shabby comedic effect. Like that whole minute of Lame Canadian where he poses. Overall, this movie was a disappointment. I'm only a freshman in high school. I've grown up on this franchise and I've always been a fan. Until now. Woody would never leave the gang. Never. I'm highly offended that this movie made it past the test viewers. I'm utterly horrified and shocked.\n\nSincerely,\nA disappointed 14 year old fan.
