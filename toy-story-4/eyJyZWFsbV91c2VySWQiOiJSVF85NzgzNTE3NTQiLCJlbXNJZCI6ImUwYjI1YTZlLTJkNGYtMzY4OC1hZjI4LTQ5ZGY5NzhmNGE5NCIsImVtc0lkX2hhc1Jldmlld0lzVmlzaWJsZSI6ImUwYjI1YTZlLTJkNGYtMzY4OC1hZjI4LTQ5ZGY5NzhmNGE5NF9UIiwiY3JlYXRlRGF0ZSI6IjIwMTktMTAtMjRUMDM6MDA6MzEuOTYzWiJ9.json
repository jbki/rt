The film did not have a sense of adventure or fun. The sub text of the film was stressful and a source frustration. No laughs, no fun moments. The subject matter was heavy...it's a kids film for crying out loud. The story did not need to be told. It seemed more aimed at adults than kids. Most of the film is played out in the antique store. The antique store is gloomy and depressing. The film had no ingenuity or levity. Very meh.","displayName":"Liam H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-22T22:44:21.051Z","updateDate":"2019-10-22T22:44:21.051Z","user":{"userId":"975641400","realm":"RT","displayName":"Liam H","accountLink":"/user/id/975641400"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"People didn't want a toy story 4 as it would ruined the way that toy story 3 ended, but it didn't at all. This isn't a \"Andy\" film, this one is focusing on Bonnie growing up with the toys and also showing us that Woody needs to move on from being Andy's favourite toy. Yes this film moves away from focusing on the main set of toys to focus on the brand new set of characters, but that's where the humour comes from and this is definitely the funniest toy story movie and its down to the new characters, the main stand out is Forky, the chemistry with him and Woody is 2 stand out performances inside this film. The main villain, Gabby Gabby is probably the most complex villain in the franchise, but I don't think she is the greatest villain, but still great to watch. Bringing back Bo Peep into the fold really helps to bring Woody's arc to a wonderful and emotional ending. However I do not think this is the most emotional toy story film as that belongs to toy story 3, but it's still emotional to see what happens at the end of the film, especially the final words that Woody and Buzz share together. That door has closed, or has it?????  \nWhat a way to end the most perfect animated franchise, and one of the most perfect (if not the perfect) film franchise ever made.....

That all changed when Toy Story 4 was announced. Upon learning of a fourth sequel, I was unsurprised and disappointed at Disney's seemingly endless level of corporate greed.\n\nCynicism aside, I was pleasantly surprised (to an extent). Toy Story 4 manages to retain the charm and whimsy of the earlier films and isn't a total soulless cash-grab. I actually liked the themes it explored as well as the new characters - Forky's existential crises and Key/Peele's arguing were both quite enjoyable. This was a good, not amazing, Toy Story film that is likely to leave fans of the franchise or just fans of Pixar in general pleased.","displayName":"Max P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1490297350/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-22T13:47:16.529Z","updateDate":"2019-10-22T13:47:16.529Z","user":{"userId":"922031976","realm":"RT","displayName":"Max P","accountLink":"/user/id/922031976"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Pixar allways do great or better.
