The soundtrack by the talented Randy Newman call backs to the first two Toy Story movies, which brought back great memories of those films. \n\nThe voice acting of the main cast like Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts, and Joan Cusack still sound as talented as they were in 1995. The voices brought in for the new characters like Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), Forky (Tony Hale), and Duke Kaboom (Keanu Reeves) are welcome additions.\n\nThe story is easy to follow, but dramatic and somewhat deep at moments, especially to those who grew up with the franchise. Woody notices that Bonnie is unhappy, in which he helps create the arts and crafts toy, Forky. Forky tries to declare himself as trash, however, and it is up to Woody to show him his place as a toy. They then go on a road trip with Bonnie with the rest of the gang, and Woody unexpectedly reunites with Bo Peep again. This, along with other problems Woody and the other toys face over the course of the film create some great tension.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I feel this film should be seen as more of an epilogue or extension to the events of the third film, as it focuses more on Woody, Bo, and the new characters rather than the toys we know. That doesn't mean they don't get their chance to shine in this film though. Buzz still remains as the loyal friend of Woody, and so does Jessie, but their roles seem to be pushed aside a bit, which is my only issue with the film.\n\nThis still is a great conclusion to one of Pixar's greatest series of films, and also showcases the talent that this studio still has after all these years.","displayName":"Drew M.
