I would have liked more interaction with some of the beloved characters from 1, 2, and 3.  Forky was just not a lovable character and found it wasn't enough for Bonnie to love him, the audience needs to love him too to feel a connection.  There were not enough laughable moments.  The last 10 minutes were the best, but the rest of the movie was just so-so.","displayName":"Teresa C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-22T22:25:36.280Z","updateDate":"2019-07-22T22:25:36.280Z","user":{"userId":"4b85e966-7b83-42d6-b164-78faa9bfd1f9","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Teresa C","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"An absolutely wonderful addition to the series!
