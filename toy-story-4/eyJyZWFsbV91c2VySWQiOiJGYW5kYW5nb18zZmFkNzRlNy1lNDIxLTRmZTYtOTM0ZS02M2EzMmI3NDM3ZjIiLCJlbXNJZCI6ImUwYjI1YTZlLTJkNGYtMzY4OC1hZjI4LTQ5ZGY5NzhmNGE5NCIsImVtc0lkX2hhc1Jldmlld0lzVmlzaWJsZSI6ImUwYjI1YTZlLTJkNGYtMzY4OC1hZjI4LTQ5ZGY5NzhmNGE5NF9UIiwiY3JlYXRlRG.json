I liked the new characters and it was a funny movie. I personally really enjoyed Woodys and Bo peeps romance I thought that was sweet. My only problem and it wasnt a big one was with Forky. I thought he was an ok character but It felt odd that it was such a big event to save him and then his importance kinda faded out. But overall a great toy story movie.","displayName":"Gabriel","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-13T15:14:43.150Z","updateDate":"2019-07-13T15:14:43.150Z","user":{"userId":"498f68cb-0a39-411c-b981-c3061f868e36","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Gabriel","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 13, 2019"}]}
