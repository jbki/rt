This movie has mixed emotions and makes the audience reflect on their history reminding how we valued our toys when we were young. Great story, with great voice overs. It is one of the greatest animated movie of all times.","displayName":"Rowang R","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2976041829106351/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T20:08:05.288Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T20:08:16.719Z","user":{"userId":"978487605","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rowang R","accountLink":"/user/id/978487605"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"6d ago"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I have loved You Story since I was a kid and this movie was amazing. I love the animation, the character growth, and that the movie answered the questions that I was thinking in the 3rd one. There are parts I didn't like though. The ending was done too quickly to feel anything and Buzz was poorly written this time. Spoiler. Woody grows even more because he realizes that he isn't the favorite toy but if you listen to him, he partly wanted to stay with Andy. Buzz they dumb down and make him more stupid for kids. If you are a huge Woody fan like me and you had questions about the 3rd movie, see this movie.","displayName":"Jessica F","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1244147469073811/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T18:05:17.107Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T18:05:36.918Z","user":{"userId":"977801850","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jessica F","accountLink":"/user/id/977801850"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It amazes me how Pixar has managed to once again deliver an awesome Toy Story film.

It never felt like that however, they still had a story to tell, and it was worth hearing. I found many of the newly introduced characters to be flat, but there were one or two who resonated with me. I just had to keep in mind that I am no longer the target audience for these films. The visuals were jaw-dropping, the different materials the toys are made out of and the animation were truly stunning. Disney Pixar's fist attempt at a quadrilliogy and they nailed it.","displayName":"Aaron P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T11:30:45.134Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T11:31:02.897Z","user":{"userId":"978002815","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aaron P","accountLink":"/user/id/978002815"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"An unnecessary sequel","displayName":"Brandon G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T11:23:40.158Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T11:23:45.562Z","user":{"userId":"977909713","realm":"RT","displayName":"Brandon G","accountLink":"/user/id/977909713"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Toy Story 4 brings the best Pixar has to offer in an emotionally satisfying ending to this amazing franchise that will leave you crying harder than in 3.","displayName":"Gavin H","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/2932240933475317/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-28T06:04:36.411Z","updateDate":"2019-12-28T06:04:39.795Z","user":{"userId":"978485950","realm":"RT","displayName":"Gavin H","accountLink":"/user/id/978485950"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"My favorite childhood movie of all time comes back. üò¢üëè Toy story 4 is the best and toy story 4 make this series still the best.
