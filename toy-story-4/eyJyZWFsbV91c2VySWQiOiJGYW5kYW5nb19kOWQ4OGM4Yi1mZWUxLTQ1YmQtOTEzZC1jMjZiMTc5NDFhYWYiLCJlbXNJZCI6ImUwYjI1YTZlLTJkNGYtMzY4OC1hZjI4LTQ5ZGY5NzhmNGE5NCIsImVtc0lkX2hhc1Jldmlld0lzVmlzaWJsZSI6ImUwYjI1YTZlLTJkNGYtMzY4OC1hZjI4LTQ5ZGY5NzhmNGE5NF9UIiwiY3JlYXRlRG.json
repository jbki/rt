Well animated, funny, cute. I know my child enjoys the idea of toys having a reality that adults are just to myopic to see but that kids fully enjoy. I thought the movie took a turn for the worse (from 5 stars down to 4) when the story became too much about the toys, and less of the cute interaction between the toys and the humans. Then, it became downright creepy when (spoiler alert) the doll Gabby went psycho on Woody, having her mannequin \"goons\" on woody to basically harvest his organs (voice box) for her own selfish enterprise. Really, I don't know if other adults picked up on this even though I'm sure the kids didn't. I honestly could not decide if Gabby was supposed to be a villain in this plot, yet the story was told as though she were a sympathetic character. Maybe I'm overthinking this. I think for the kiddos, still a great flick. For the adults, maybe a good opportunity for a restroom break halfway through.
