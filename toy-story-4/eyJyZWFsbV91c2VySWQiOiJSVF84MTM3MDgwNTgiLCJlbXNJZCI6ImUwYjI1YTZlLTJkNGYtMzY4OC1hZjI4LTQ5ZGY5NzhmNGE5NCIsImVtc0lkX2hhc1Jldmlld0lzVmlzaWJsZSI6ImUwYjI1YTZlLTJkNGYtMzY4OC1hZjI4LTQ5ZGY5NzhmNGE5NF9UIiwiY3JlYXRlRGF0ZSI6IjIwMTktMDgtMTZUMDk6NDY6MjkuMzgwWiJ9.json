I thought that Toy Story 3 wrapped up the series nicely and was a satisfying ending but boy was I wrong. Toy Story 4 introduces many new lovable toys leaving the movie feeling fresh. Also the humor lands a lot better than in other Toy Story movies.","displayName":"Jenna S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-16T08:11:35.851Z","updateDate":"2019-08-16T08:11:35.851Z","user":{"userId":"978200715","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jenna S","accountLink":"/user/id/978200715"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Super cute movie.

I feel, most of the characters fall into the realm of what happened to Tom Hardy in Mad Max. You could've gotten rid of the majority of characters we know and love and still the story would've worked. I felt bad for Buzz...hardly in the movie the poor guy.

Toy story 4 brings all the charms that make this franchise so incredible along with a premise that will resonate with older audiences while entertaining the kids. With its lighthearted plot, detailed and gorgeous animation, and tons of laughs, this new entry earns its place on this immaculate film series, even if the plot itself isn't as strong as previous ones. Josh Cooley does an incredible job introducing new characters, bringing others back, and paying tribute to the primary with an ending that's highly emotional and impactful thanks to the journey and situations we have seen this characters go through in other installments. But Toy Story 4 doesn't only succeed for what it follows but also has its deeper topics and enough twists and insight to set itself apart. With all that being said, this is a film that will win everyone's hearts, but primarily the hearts of the fans, while rewarding them with such a beautiful and bittersweet chapter.","displayName":"Adrian V","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-16T00:30:20.056Z","updateDate":"2019-08-16T00:30:20.056Z","user":{"userId":"977328015","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adrian V","accountLink":"/user/id/977328015"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 16, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was my daughterâ€™s first movie ever.
