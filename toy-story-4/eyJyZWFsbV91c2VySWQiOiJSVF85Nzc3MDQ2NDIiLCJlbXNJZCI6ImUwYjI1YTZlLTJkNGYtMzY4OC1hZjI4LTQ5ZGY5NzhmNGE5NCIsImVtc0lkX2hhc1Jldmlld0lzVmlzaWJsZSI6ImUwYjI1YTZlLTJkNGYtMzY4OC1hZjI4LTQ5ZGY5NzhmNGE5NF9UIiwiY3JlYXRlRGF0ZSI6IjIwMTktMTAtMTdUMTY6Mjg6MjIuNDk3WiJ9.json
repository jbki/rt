In this movie Woody is no longer the leader of the toys ,and we learn Bonnie has grown tired of him and doesn‚Äôt want to play with him anymore. This leads to Bonnie creating Forky a spork made in arts and crafts which leads to an unexpected adventure where Bo Peep returns and is unarguably the best she‚Äôs ever been as a character! Another great villain who you can get behind and another great story that could possibly outshine Toy Story 3!
