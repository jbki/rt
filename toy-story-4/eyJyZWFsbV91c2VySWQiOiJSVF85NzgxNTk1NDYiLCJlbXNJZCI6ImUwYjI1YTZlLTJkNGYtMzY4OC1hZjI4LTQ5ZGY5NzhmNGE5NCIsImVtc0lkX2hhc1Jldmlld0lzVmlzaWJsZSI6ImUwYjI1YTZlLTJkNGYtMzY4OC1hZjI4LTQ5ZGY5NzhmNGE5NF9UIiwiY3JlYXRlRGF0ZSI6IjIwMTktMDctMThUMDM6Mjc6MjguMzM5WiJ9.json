I'm between giving it a 3 to 3.5 stars. Even if they hadn't made this, the original ending was enough to be satisfying, which really just says they made this to make some $$$. But with that being said, although it didn't make me cry like 3 did, and it was more of  Woody's adventure, it's still a cute addition and fun adventure. Something to pass the time and it was enjoyable. But if they make a 4th, you know they are just absolutely milking it.","displayName":"Isabella","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-18T03:20:34.216Z","updateDate":"2019-07-18T03:20:34.216Z","user":{"userId":"57ACAEB5-34BC-40D0-88D0-3208A6DBAA7D","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Isabella","accountLink":null},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 18, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wow. 4th movie so fun.
