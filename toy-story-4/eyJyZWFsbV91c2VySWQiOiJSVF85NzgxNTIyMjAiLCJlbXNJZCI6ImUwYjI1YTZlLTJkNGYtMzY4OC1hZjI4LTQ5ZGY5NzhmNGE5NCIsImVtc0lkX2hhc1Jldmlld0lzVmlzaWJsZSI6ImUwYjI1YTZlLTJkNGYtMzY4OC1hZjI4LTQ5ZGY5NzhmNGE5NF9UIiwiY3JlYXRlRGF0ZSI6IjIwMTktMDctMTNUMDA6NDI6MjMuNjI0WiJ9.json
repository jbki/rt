I just can't help finding myself wishing that they just ended it with number 3. That being said, Woody and the gang are charming as always and the new characters really help get you through the feelings you aren't ready to have at the end. Ducky and Bunny deserve their own short film as they had me and the entire audience in my theater rolling with laughter proving Key & Peele are a comedy duo that will never get old.

I believed that the third installment had a perfect ending and that there wasn't a need for a fourth entry. Boy was I wrong. The movie itself is animated beautifully, everything was crisp and gorgeous to look at. And the story? Well, it's just as amazing as the animation. The movie mostly centers around woody and bo-peep; you don't really get to see the other toys all that much. And to be honest, I'm fine with that. Pixar didn't throw the conclusion of the third movie out, rather, they continued woody's story because his character arc was not yet finished. The other toys... their stories really did end in Toy Story Three, which is why this movie focuses on woody rather than all of the other toys. Overall, I loved this movie and cried my eyes out at the end. This is truly pixar at it's finest.
