The old toys from the other movie were good in the movie but I wanted them to be in more of movie. Woodly was a great lead in the movie and helped out the story. The toy animal that was at the fair was good and very funny. The ending was a little bit sad but also happy. The villain I did not care about and backstory was not that great.\nThis was a good fun movie in the toy story saga but not the greatest or best Pixar movie ever made.\n","displayName":"John  T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-05T19:42:20.524Z","updateDate":"2019-10-05T19:44:39.145Z","user":{"userId":"978257975","realm":"RT","displayName":"John  T","accountLink":"/user/id/978257975"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"might be the best toy story","displayName":"Niels W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-05T17:41:23.651Z","updateDate":"2019-10-05T17:41:23.651Z","user":{"userId":"978305792","realm":"RT","displayName":"Niels W","accountLink":"/user/id/978305792"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Woody dying was the most epic part but 10/10 made me giggle","displayName":"Oliber K","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-05T17:27:24.882Z","updateDate":"2019-10-05T17:27:24.882Z","user":{"userId":"978305735","realm":"RT","displayName":"Oliber K","accountLink":"/user/id/978305735"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 05, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Personally i loved the movie, it was a fitting end to a group of movies that i grew up watching and the final moments in the film did give me a little tear.

I went in believing Forky would be a dumb and stupid character, I was well and truly shown differently. The end of the saga is a tear-jerker and the culmination of years of the toys becoming a big part of pop culture really makes you feel for them.  Key and Peel were a great addition to the cast, along with Keanu Reeves. It was a wild ride that had highs and lows of laughter, sorrow and just a little creeped out at time (I'm looking at you dummy's!) that just fits. The biggest surprise that put a smile on my face was the credits rolling with one writer being Parks & Recreation and The Office alum, Rashida Jones. Excellent movie","displayName":"Liam B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-04T14:42:16.045Z","updateDate":"2019-10-04T14:42:16.045Z","user":{"userId":"956035219","realm":"RT","displayName":"Liam B","accountLink":"/user/id/956035219"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 04, 2019"}]}
