I told him it was very cool, and apparently they'd just finished watching it. The couple asked him to tell me who his favorite character was and he proceeded to yell \"FORKY, FORKY\". I told him I really wanna see it, and later as they were leaving the boy looked back and yelled \"GO SEE TOYS, GO SEE FORKY\". And so, I felt somewhat obligated!\n\nForky was definitely a stand out, his introduction was hilarious and his quirks as a \"newborn toy\" are probably the funniest bits in the movie. Followed closely by Key & Peele as Bunny & Ducky, their natural chemistry lives even in animated form and it was honestly a really refreshing change of pace for Toy Story. Another highlight was Keanu Reeves as Duke Kaboom, \"Canada's Greatest Stuntman\", he's not in the movie as much as I expected him to be but when he was he pretty much stole the scene every time. I would argue this is probably the funniest of all 4 movies, everyone gets a chance to shine and there are some fun running gags.\n\nHowever, the introduction of new characters comes with the sidelining of familiar faces. Rex, Ham, the Potato Heads (with archived lines from the late Don Rickles), Jesse and so on are present and ready, but they're restricted to one liners and emotional support. Even the ones introduced in Toy Story 3 don't have much to do. It's definitely up to Woody, Buzz and Bo Peep carry the load, and carry it they do. Bo Peep, a character meant to be the flirt for Woody in Toy Story 1&2, is now a battle damaged warrior who kicks ass! Her story as a lost toy is one of the most interesting parts and it really surprised me just how much emotional baggage she was given. Unfortunately Buzz doens't have much to do, he has a running gag throughout the movie that got some laughs outta me but what they did to make it work kinda took me out of it sometimes. I guess any sort of character development ended with Toy Story 2. Having said that it was really good to hear Tim Allen back and he hasn't skipped a beat as Buzz Lightyear. The central villain character is a toy named Gabby Gabby, and I was afraid of having another toy villain because every villain after Toy Story 1 has been a toy and they've never been as good as Sid. That's still very much the case, but Gabby Gabby is really the best of the toy villains! She has interesting motivations and you can actually sypathize with her.\n\nBut Toy Story has not at all forgotten who the main character is. Woody remains the core of this series, and somehow 4 movies in and 24 years later he continues to grow as a character. His arc is wisely set up from the very beginning of the movie and the themes related to him are really the driving force. And these themes come with some unexpectedly emotional moments, perhaps even more so Toy Story 3. That's right, get ready to tear up my fellow manchildren.\n\nAnyway, I really liked this movie. Better than I expected and definitely more ambitious than Tory Story 3. And the animation, my god, who sold their soul to make it look that good? I'm almost certain they filmed in actual places for certain parts, it's nuts.\n\nTHANK YOU IF YOU READ THROUGH! 8/10","displayName":"Cody J","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1069801948/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-07-06T05:22:38.578Z","updateDate":"2019-07-06T05:22:38.578Z","user":{"userId":"906538361","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cody J","accountLink":"/user/id/906538361"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Movie was filled with adventure throughout and was also extremely funny!
