I have grown up with all the Toy Story films and I don't think this one dissapoints. However, I did like the ending of Toy Story 3 more than this ending. If they would have ended the trilogy with 3 I would have been happy. The movie could seem a little unecessary, but it was a good final adventure with the gang. Overall it was a good movie and a decent way to end one of the best animated trilogies of all time.","displayName":"Cullen O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-23T14:00:09.180Z","updateDate":"2019-07-23T14:01:03.048Z","user":{"userId":"978166989","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cullen O","accountLink":"/user/id/978166989"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 23, 2019"}]}
