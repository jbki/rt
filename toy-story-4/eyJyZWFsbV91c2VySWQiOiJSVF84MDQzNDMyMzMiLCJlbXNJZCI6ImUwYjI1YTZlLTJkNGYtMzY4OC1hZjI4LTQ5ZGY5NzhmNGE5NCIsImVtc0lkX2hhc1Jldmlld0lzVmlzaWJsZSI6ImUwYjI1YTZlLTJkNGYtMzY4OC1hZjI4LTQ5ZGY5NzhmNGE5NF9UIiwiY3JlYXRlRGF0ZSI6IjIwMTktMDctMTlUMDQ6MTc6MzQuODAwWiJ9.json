Toy Story 3 is still the FAR Superior Conclusion to a perfect trilogy. If it was a TV special I'd enjoy it a lot but The fact it's a movie that didn't need to be made hurts it. Tho I did mantear once. Also I really liked The new Doll character introduced with the Dummy henchmen & felt for her. But again I feel the movie didn't need to be made on a perfect trilogy especially since that last one had me bawling ðŸ˜­ so I'd give it a 3.5/5 or a High Rental.","displayName":"Jordan D","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1375909822519555/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-19T04:12:06.194Z","updateDate":"2019-07-19T04:12:06.194Z","user":{"userId":"976962546","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jordan D","accountLink":"/user/id/976962546"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"My 8 yr old (who is also grieving his uncle/best friend's death since January) HATED this movie! I understand that things change and the nature of things is to \"move on\". I wish I'd known that Woody would be leaving the group BEFORE we went to see it. I think this was just too big of change for my kiddo, coupled with the HUGE change in our personal lives. For myself, ( a massive Toy Story fan), it wasn't a great plot. The graphics are bar none, which is always expected. However, there wasn't much meat. Disappointing.","displayName":"Katrina","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-19T04:10:59.386Z","updateDate":"2019-07-19T04:10:59.386Z","user":{"userId":"ae26d3dd-b9cd-4d29-aeb5-e71e378e7df0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Katrina","accountLink":null},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 19, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This was an amazing addition to the collection of toy story films.
