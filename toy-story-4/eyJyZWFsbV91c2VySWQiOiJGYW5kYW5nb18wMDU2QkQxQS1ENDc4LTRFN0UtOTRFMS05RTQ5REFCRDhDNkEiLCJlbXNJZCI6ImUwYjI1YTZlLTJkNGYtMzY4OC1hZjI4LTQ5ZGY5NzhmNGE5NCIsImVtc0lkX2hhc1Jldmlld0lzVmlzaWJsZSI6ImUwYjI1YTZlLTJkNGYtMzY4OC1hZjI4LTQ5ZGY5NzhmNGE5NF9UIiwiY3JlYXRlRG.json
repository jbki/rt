This is supposedly the final Toy Story, but who knows if that’s true. The “ending” at the end felt a bit off to me. As a viewer of Toy Story since the beginning, the ending left me feeling mixed. Overall, Toy Story 4 is an adorable story of children and their emotional connection to toys through the perspective of classic Toy Story characters.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-28T21:00:50.597Z","updateDate":"2019-07-28T21:00:50.597Z","user":{"userId":"794065432","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/794065432"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Weird parts but good","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-28T20:02:03.465Z","updateDate":"2019-07-28T20:02:03.465Z","user":{"userId":"915818841","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/915818841"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Sweet and funny!
