The third film ended the series perfectly. However after seeing Toy Story 4 I have to say I am very impressed and surprised. I really liked this film. It is definitely the weakest of the Quadrilogy for me, however that doesn't say all that much as all the movies are so good. Pixar have done it again. They have put in so much care, effort and time into this. It's been 9 years since the 3rd film so there was a lot of expectation. This is a funny, moving, charming film which is a great extension of Toy Story 3's ending assuming this is the last one. The ending is satisfying, it's not super dark and intense like the incinerator from part 3 but it leaves you feeling warm. The new characters are all awesome, especially Gabby Gabby. Her character arc was very emotional, we think at first she is the antagonist however that is since revealed not to be true. I also think Duke Caboom, Ducky and Bunny are all hilarious.This is also a greta ending for Woody and I feel like Woody's character has really come full circle and has matured. Its great seeing Bo back and rekindling her relationship with Woody and seeing how her character has changed. The music is classic Toy Story and it works. It moves at a great pace. Its a wonderfully surprising return to these characters but the only criticism I have is that a lot of the original characters don't get a lot to do, which is a slight shame but other than that, well done Pixar! :) This movie was unnecessary but I am glad you made it. But now is a good place to stop. The Toy Story films have been consistently fantastic and the 4 movies work and I really feel this film is the official ending of the Toy Story saga and it should stay that way. I would score this film a 9/10","displayName":"Ollie P","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100001287176093/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-29T09:37:48.844Z","updateDate":"2019-08-29T09:38:31.743Z","user":{"userId":"904047929","realm":"RT","displayName":"Ollie P","accountLink":"/user/id/904047929"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Simply mazing.. definitely has to be the last one based on the end.","displayName":"Travis","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-28T19:40:47.068Z","updateDate":"2019-08-28T19:40:47.068Z","user":{"userId":"CC3521FE-3CF9-4F7D-B4AA-7B486951D01C","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Travis","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Probably the funniest of all 4 films.
