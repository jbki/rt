Woody our ever present source of righteousness finds himself struggling to come to terms with no longer being the beloved favourite. Something's never change though, as Woody remains the kindest and loyalist toy you would ever want. He goes the extra mile to ensure that Bonnie doesn't get down in the dumps with her kindergarten blues. This leads to the introduction of our newest member, the surprising engaging ‘Forky'. Several events follow until we end up riding that old movie trope, The Road Trip. \n\nSlow to get going, the story gets stuck in a loop. It's not till the end where you see the Toy Story you love begin to flourish and blossom, making you feel all those emotions this franchise has made you ever so familiar with. \nRepetition runs rife, woven into the fabric of the narrative. The repetition begins and ends with Forky, the newest member of our toy chest. Suffering from a crisis of identity and belonging Forky seeks refuge in the place he believes he belongs. Thankfully this source of personal irritation is lulled by a tender scene, ran by Woody.\n\nWhile it may start slow, the opening sequence is quintessential Pixar, a delightful recap (that I was more than grateful for), brimming with warmth and emotion, just lovely storytelling. Quickly catching you up on Bo Peep's initial exit, before her return as a kick-ass, wandering renegade, seeking a life of freedom, which opposes the standard Toy life. \n\nAs for the new characters, they're all good, and there's a few I would've liked to see more of - and had their backstory improved upon. Gabby is a refreshing antagonist for a film targeted towards kids. She operates in the grey area of ‘villains', she is without a doubt an intimidating on-screen presence, but the lines are blurred between good and evil, which is pleasing to see. The other side characters are all good, standouts being Duke Caboom and Bunny and Ducky. Ultimately they're sacrificed as Woody takes centre stage. He dominates the screen time, gobbling it all up. \n\nI do feel I should acknowledge that this 4th tale of the toys hits on similar beats covered in the first three tales. There is a distinct similarity in how the plot and character actions are bent to progress the story. At times it may feel contrived, but that feeling will be over-run by sheer nostalgia and joy that will never leave these characters.\n\nIn Toy Story 3 we all felt like the story had ran its course, and finished perfectly, but we were wrong, Toy Story was finished, but Woody's Story still had legs in it yet, and I'm pleased to say that this 4th installment did a wonderful job of telling and closing his arc, that meant so much to so many.\n \nSimply it's Woody's Story not Toy Story.","displayName":"Toby H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-08-03T20:24:02.347Z","updateDate":"2019-08-03T20:24:02.347Z","user":{"userId":"978180166","realm":"RT","displayName":"Toby H","accountLink":"/user/id/978180166"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"great movies as always","displayName":"KimberlyBarnes","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-03T19:56:20.762Z","updateDate":"2019-08-03T19:56:20.762Z","user":{"userId":"5C0EE349-9B27-4C3A-A49D-EC3EC04CE481","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"KimberlyBarnes","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Cute movie and I really enjoyed it","displayName":"paula  m","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-03T19:45:00.826Z","updateDate":"2019-08-03T19:45:00.826Z","user":{"userId":"2c620d0d-63ca-4a5b-b887-e9d10cfc89f3","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"paula  m","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 03, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Enjoyed very much.
