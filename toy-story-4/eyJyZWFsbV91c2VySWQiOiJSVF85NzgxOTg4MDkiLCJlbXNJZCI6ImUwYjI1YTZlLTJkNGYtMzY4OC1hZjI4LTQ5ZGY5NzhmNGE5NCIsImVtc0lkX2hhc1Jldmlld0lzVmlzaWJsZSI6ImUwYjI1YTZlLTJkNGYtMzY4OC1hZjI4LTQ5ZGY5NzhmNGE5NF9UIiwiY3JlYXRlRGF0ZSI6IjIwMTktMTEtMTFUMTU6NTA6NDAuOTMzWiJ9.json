Disney-Pixar at their best. Superb storytelling, voice acting, direction, art, production design, character development. I was deeply touched by the amount of chemistry and emotions shown by these \"toys\".

It isn't gripping as any of its antecessor, it follows the same formula of Toy Story 3 (they arrive at a new place, the toys which seem first nice are bad and vice versa) and it lacked of something more original for me. The new characters were boring also. It will entertein younger viewers but its long time fans won't be pleased. The visuals are still great, as the soundtrack.","displayName":"Francisco L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000983354704/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-10T17:54:34.824Z","updateDate":"2019-11-10T17:54:39.358Z","user":{"userId":"967023256","realm":"RT","displayName":"Francisco L","accountLink":"/user/id/967023256"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Not horrible, but they should have stopped at 3.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-10T06:16:56.320Z","updateDate":"2019-11-10T06:16:56.320Z","user":{"userId":"933944070","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/933944070"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Kind of negates everything from the previous film, but still enjoyable","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-09T18:36:59.376Z","updateDate":"2019-11-09T18:36:59.376Z","user":{"userId":"970192799","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/970192799"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"Doesn't live up to the franchise groundbreaking achievement.
