Wanst till End Credits that I found out who he played. Plot was very good. Most of the Toy Sotry movie's we all knew what was going to happen in some way. This one, I had no Idea what Direction it was going in.\n\nDisliked : Only thing I did not like about this movie was the (Creepy Puppets) in that shop. Made me feel like it was going to be a kids (Toy Story) mixed with a (Stephen King) movie. Otherwise, I loved how the movie was.\n\nWhat I think they could of done with \"Toy Story 4\" in my eye's.\n......N/A... Because I told you... (Will not Spoil anything from this movie).
