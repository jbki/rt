Compare it to the original and it's like night and day! \n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the movie was... fine. Woody spends the movie learning that he's completely unnecessary to Bonnie's life, which feels like a direct nod to this movies position in the series. Unnecessary. It had a few good laughs, but it's mostly just sad (without the heart of TS3). The kids at the theatre seemed bored, frankly. \n\nI will say, Forky made me laugh a lot, and ventriloquist dummies will never not be scary!\n\nAlso, was there supposed to be a short before the film? If so, my theatre didn't show it...","displayName":"Chris S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-06T17:26:50.238Z","updateDate":"2019-08-06T17:26:50.238Z","user":{"userId":"927349349","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chris S","accountLink":"/user/id/927349349"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"This movie is a solid addition to the franchise. Pixar is back in true form to deliver a fun, meaningful film to warm audience hearts around the world. It's less tear-jerking than previous entries, but it still weaves the Pixar signature great, meaningful narrative that bucks storytelling standard. There are some small but significant character deviations for Buzz and Bo Peep, and not always in a good way. But apart from some mostly harmless missteps it is the sequel fans hoped they could make and feared they wouldn't be able to pull off. Most people probably knew they were going to watch it before reading this, but if you were on the fence, definitely go see it.\n\nClosest comparison: It's like a fresh Toy Story 3 with some of the logistical problems of Finding Dory and a touch of sequelitis.\n\nSetting: Family Fantasy\nPlot: Adventure\nTone: Family Adventure","displayName":"Christian B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-06T17:20:58.652Z","updateDate":"2019-08-06T17:20:58.652Z","user":{"userId":"977547201","realm":"RT","displayName":"Christian B","accountLink":"/user/id/977547201"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"Extremely overrated in my opinion.
