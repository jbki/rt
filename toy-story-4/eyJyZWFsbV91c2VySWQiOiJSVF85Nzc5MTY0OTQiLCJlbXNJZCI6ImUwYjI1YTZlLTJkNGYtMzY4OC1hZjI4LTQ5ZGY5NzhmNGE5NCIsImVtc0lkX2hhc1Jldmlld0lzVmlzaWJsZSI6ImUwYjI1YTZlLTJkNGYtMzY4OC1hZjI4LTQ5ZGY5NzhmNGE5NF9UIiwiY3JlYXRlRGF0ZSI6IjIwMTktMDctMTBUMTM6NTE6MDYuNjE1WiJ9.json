Woody and Buzz and the gang are back on an adventure, but instead of Buzz rescuing Woody, it's Woody rescuing a new toy and Buzz going after them. It is basically a rehash of the 2nd Toy Story where Woody meets new toys and makes friends with them. I didn't like them adding a female star to the film aka Bo. It seems like a lot of movies are doing that these days and isn't really necessary. The new toys Gabby Gabby and  Duke Caboom I liked the most but not so much the 2 stuffed toys Bunny and Ducky. Most of the movie is focused on Woody with Buzz and the gang taking a back seat with not that many scenes. They did endure lots of comedy into this, it seems Pixar films are doing more of that these days. However, this movie lacks a main villain. We had Sid then Al then Loxo the bear, finally we have..... What no one? Gabby Gabby really isn't one so have this movie without one really just opens up the film to have more jokes instead, boo hoo. The ending was not as sad as it was in Toy Story 3, but it leaves you hanging a bit. Maybe there might be another Toy Story down the road, but I really doubt that. I'd recommend you see this Pixar film. It is still very good for a kids movie with lots of jokes and entertaining stuff throughout, especially with Keanu Reeves playing Duke Caboom.","displayName":"Adrien B","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1293642169/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-10T12:41:02.631Z","updateDate":"2019-07-10T12:41:02.631Z","user":{"userId":"891899909","realm":"RT","displayName":"Adrien B","accountLink":"/user/id/891899909"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"The themes of the Toy Story films are becoming more and more mature. I guess the creators know that the kids who saw the first Toy Story back in 1995 are now almost in their thirties. It's a pity that the good ol' toys (except for Woody and Bo) didn't have much screentime, though. Not even Buzz.","displayName":"Sotiris K","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1575610046079850/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-10T12:37:40.030Z","updateDate":"2019-07-10T12:37:40.030Z","user":{"userId":"975524301","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sotiris K","accountLink":"/user/id/975524301"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"I thought this was a boring and limited movie that one of my kids fell asleep during.
