The ideas that were worth exploring with Forky were boundless-what is the meaning of being a toy? Toy Story 4 explores this idea for a little while and then fully abandons it halfway through the movie. It turns into the usual Toy Story plotlines. Forky is barely a part of the finale. Buzz is forced into the storyline when he really doesn't serve any purpose whatsoever (he is really forced in there to introduce two side characters and get a key, which is really something unnecessary for the story to happen). Pixar delivers a good film, which I consider Pixar's version of phoning it in. I wish they had fully explored Forky's storyline to make a great Pixar film.","displayName":null,"displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-06T15:57:12.504Z","updateDate":"2019-07-06T15:57:12.504Z","user":{"userId":"260291094","realm":"RT","displayName":null,"accountLink":"/user/id/260291094"},"score":2.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 06, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Good Story, Fun to watch.","displayName":"mkamla","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-06T15:54:57.692Z","updateDate":"2019-07-06T15:57:43.120Z","user":{"userId":"e506a8c3-b9ca-45c1-be2f-152f82082c99","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"mkamla","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 06, 2019"}]}
