The toys joke is relatable to both child and adult alike, while the dramatic moment is uniquely touching because the characters are toys (just imagine the last hugging moments and replace them with humans. It won't be as dramatic).\nBeing a sequel don't make this shadowed by its predecessor too. In fact, toy story as a movie universe has become stronger than ever. From the first toy story the sub-theme of toys as children's plaything, evolved into collector item in ts2, become hands-me-down in ts3, and in ts4 we got toys that was made by the children. It do not betray the whole scope that this happened in toys world and I personally find this to be such an amazing quirk.","displayName":"Jagd D","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T05:01:11.714Z","updateDate":"2019-07-07T05:01:11.803Z","user":{"userId":"978144164","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jagd D","accountLink":"/user/id/978144164"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"}]}
