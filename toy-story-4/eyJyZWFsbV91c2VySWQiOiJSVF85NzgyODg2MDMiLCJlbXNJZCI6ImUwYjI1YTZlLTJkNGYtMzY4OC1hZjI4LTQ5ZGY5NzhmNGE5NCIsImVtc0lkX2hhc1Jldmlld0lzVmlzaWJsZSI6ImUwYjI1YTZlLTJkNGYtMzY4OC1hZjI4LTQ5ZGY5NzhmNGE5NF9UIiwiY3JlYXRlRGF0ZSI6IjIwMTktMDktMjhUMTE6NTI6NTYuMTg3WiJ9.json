While on a road trip with her parents Bonnie losses her new favorite toy that she made in preschool and Woody attempts to get him back, and along the way he reunites with Bo Peep, who's joined a traveling carnival.  Most of the original cast returns along with several new additions, including Christina Hendricks, Tony Hale, and Keanu Reeves.  Once again the series takes on some very poignant themes, but it isn't quite as nuanced as in previous films and comes off as kind of talky and heavy handed.  The lack of a strong villain is also problematic.  However, the comedy is incredibly well-done and delivers a lot of laughs.  But it also has a lot of heart.  Though it's not as strong as some of the other entries in the franchise, Toy Story 4 is a fun and heartwarming family film.","displayName":"Dann M","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000440772572/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-09-28T00:36:07.642Z","updateDate":"2019-09-28T00:36:07.642Z","user":{"userId":"906395584","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dann M","accountLink":"/user/id/906395584"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Sep 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"The other Toy Story films were a lot better.
