Buzz was played off as a complete airhead. The backup characters had basically no role in the movie.  It was all about Woody, who reminded me of Jon Snow the whole time. Well liked, people look to him as a leader, makes terrible decisions, and suffers no consequences from them.  Everyone else around him gets to do the suffering and have their lives ruined.","displayName":"Alan W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-05T18:21:24.908Z","updateDate":"2019-07-05T18:22:15.072Z","user":{"userId":"57d1ccdd-57fd-459f-ab45-90f380e4e47f","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Alan W","accountLink":null},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 05, 2019"}]}
