The series is definitely in my all time favourites, but I'm still coming to grips with this 4th film, as I thought Toy Story 3 had the perfect ending. It's still a fantastic film that does wrap it up nicely, it's just that I felt there was something missing to elevate it to the 9's and 10's I 've given the previous films. Either way I had a blast watching and may have shed some man-tears once again!","displayName":"Dan A","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-22T13:20:07.611Z","updateDate":"2019-07-22T13:20:07.611Z","user":{"userId":"976409494","realm":"RT","displayName":"Dan A","accountLink":"/user/id/976409494"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I loved it.

I only went because my 10 year old daughter has been begging me to take her.   This was probably my favorite out of the bunch.  I was anxious, happy, sad, excited!  I am pretty sure I liked it more than my daughter.
