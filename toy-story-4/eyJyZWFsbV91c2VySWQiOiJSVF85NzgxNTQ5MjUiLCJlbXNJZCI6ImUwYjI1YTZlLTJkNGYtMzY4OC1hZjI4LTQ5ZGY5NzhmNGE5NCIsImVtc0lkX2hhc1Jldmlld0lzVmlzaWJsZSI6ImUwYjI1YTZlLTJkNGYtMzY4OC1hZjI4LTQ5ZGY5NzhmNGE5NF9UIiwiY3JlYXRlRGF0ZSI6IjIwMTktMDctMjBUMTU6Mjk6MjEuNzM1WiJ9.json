First I just curious about how's keanu reeves' dubbing performance in this film, because honestly i didn't watched toy story's movie series before. So I watched this movie and I laughed, then I cried with emotional at the end of the movie. This Toy Story 4 amazed me with its plots and of course the dolls's drawings so cute, such as Gabby Gabby, Forky (you're so funny) and Duke Caboom (what a man, I love Keanu's voice)","displayName":"fonny h","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-20T15:08:49.251Z","updateDate":"2019-07-20T15:14:02.739Z","user":{"userId":"977248175","realm":"RT","displayName":"fonny h","accountLink":"/user/id/977248175"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Loved it!

Classic performances from our favorite characters, entertaining and funny additions from new characters. The movie was a little long to include the additional storylines of new characters but still kept us entertained.
