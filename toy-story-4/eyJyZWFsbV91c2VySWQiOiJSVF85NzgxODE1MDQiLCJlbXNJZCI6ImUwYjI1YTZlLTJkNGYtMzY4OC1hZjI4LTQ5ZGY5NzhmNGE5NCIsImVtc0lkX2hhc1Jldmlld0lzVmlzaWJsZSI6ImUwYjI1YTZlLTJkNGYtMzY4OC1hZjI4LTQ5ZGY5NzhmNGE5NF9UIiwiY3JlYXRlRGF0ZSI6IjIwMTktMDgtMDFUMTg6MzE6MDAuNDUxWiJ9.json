It was a wonderful experience seeing Woody, Buzz, and company on the big screen together again, but it isn't the best out of the series. I was just 6 years old when the very first one came out and it got me hooked, so this movie definitely brought back a lot of childhood memories but I still keep the original close to my heart.\n\nThe newest homemade toy Forky makes for a great imaginative addition, a lost Bo Peep shines as she takes charge right into the spotlight and Duke Caboom voiced by Keanu Reeves cashes in on the continued Keanu sensation. The movie has some great flashbacks to Andy but it is all about Bonnie. It does a great job sharing similar themes as it's predecessors and it really doesn't hit you hard in the feels until the very end which was a nice way to put an END to the Toy Story we all loved.\n\nI give it 8/10.","displayName":"Sean T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-01T18:14:06.264Z","updateDate":"2019-08-01T23:37:25.008Z","user":{"userId":"978181402","realm":"RT","displayName":"Sean T","accountLink":"/user/id/978181402"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Limited staff at late shows and limited services","displayName":"Robney C","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-01T17:54:52.648Z","updateDate":"2019-08-01T17:54:52.648Z","user":{"userId":"7B54DF3E-2EC9-4BB3-9651-38A17FF4DE5A","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Robney C","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"An excellent new (final?) chapter in the Toy Story series.

It just kept box ticking the whole way through. We get to see Andy again, there's that beautiful transition sequence that Pixar excel at to bring us up to present events and we're back with the gang pretty much where we left off.\n\nSo about half hour in I started to wonder about the old characters, the Potato heads seemed mute (I know Ron died but they said they had his dialogue covered, but 3 lines?) Even Rex was unusually quiet and unpanicked. However the new characters seamlessly replaced them and I wasn't left wondering anymore. I loved the introduction of the little cop and then the inevitable dark side in the form of the ventriloquist dummies and the creepy but pretty little talking doll. The stunt guy was a great addition and each of the new guys played a nice part in the overall story telling, not forgetting the 2 stuffed toys from the shooting range. The little alternate reality scenes with them were a genius idea and added yet another layer to the already bulging amount of depth to this film.\n\nThe animation was on another level and the realism, although held a bit in check I feel so as to not go full on photo realistic was really lovely and made the whole thing sit as a believable film a whole lot more. I loved the way that although there was this dark threat to the film that is was actually done in a really nice way and the threat was neutralised and weaved itself perfectly into the story and the antagonist became the climax of the film. Before I went in I was wondering when they were going to deliver the emotional punch in the guts and as per the previous film it was almost at the end. I thought I could avoid it, not be affected, or just brush it off somehow but damn, those guys did it again and had me crying in the cinema when the little lost girl picked Dolly up and hugged her. Crikey, these guys know how to deliver that so masterfully and pull all of the invested emotion into a simple scene, leaving you brimming with all sorts of feelings and the unstoppable moist eyes.\n\nSo yeah, we went full circle, we learned all about friendships all over again, we had Buzz on another tangent with his inner voice and overall many layers of adult themes crammed into a children's romp. But Pixar know their quarry, these guys are the masters and they can pick and choose the top talent in the world to come and work for them. I noticed the film was directed by an unfamiliar face but clearly the old guard had a huge influence on this movie. I loved it from start to finish, what a feast, what a way to go out, belly laughs, tears and I just can't wait to watch it over and over again like I do with all of Pixar's masterpieces. Simply fantastic!","displayName":"Kenny E","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/618506103/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-08-01T15:56:28.163Z","updateDate":"2019-08-01T15:56:28.163Z","user":{"userId":"795420206","realm":"RT","displayName":"Kenny E","accountLink":"/user/id/795420206"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 01, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Not their best but definitely a must see with the kids.","displayName":"Robert","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-01T15:23:24.745Z","updateDate":"2019-08-01T15:23:24.745Z","user":{"userId":"556c4745-a24c-4d95-9f57-e98f2693e7ef","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Robert","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 01, 2019"}]}
