Kind of scary. The ventriloquist dummies were scary for me and when I jumped, my almost four year old jumped  my 2 1/2 year couldnt stay for the whole thing but that is to be expected.

Also, classic characters are given criminally low amounts of screen time in favor of Woody exploring the world and meeting new faces. This is barely a Toy Story movie, and more of a way to get rid of some characters and allow the crowded Toy Story universe to shrink. I hate to say it, but Toy Story 3 should have remained the ending of this story.
