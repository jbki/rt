It has an emphasis on helping the lost toys in realizing their purpose. What lengths will a toy go to help another toy! It might be a stretch, but a delightful one.

This was a huge disappointment. The plot was a mess, there were too many characters and they were mostly flat and just band-aids when the filmmakers couldn't decide what to do next. The first three films of this series were pinnacles of entertainment and resonance. What happened? And why do the critics love this swampy disaster? I'm mystified and felt like I had to inject some truth into this morass of fake love for a faulty product. Avoid this thing, even on streaming!","displayName":"Abby C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10152380038883216/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-12T22:16:30.744Z","updateDate":"2019-08-12T22:19:28.419Z","user":{"userId":"976907145","realm":"RT","displayName":"Abby C","accountLink":"/user/id/976907145"},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie, wonderful ending.","displayName":"Mojeed O","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-12T19:57:30.498Z","updateDate":"2019-08-12T19:57:30.498Z","user":{"userId":"41F3AEA4-0E8C-4065-8BE6-495EC9B849C0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Mojeed O","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"I was good movie .My daughter loved it.","displayName":"Raju S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-12T18:51:52.947Z","updateDate":"2019-08-12T18:51:52.947Z","user":{"userId":"67218AFC-2A03-4FF6-932D-EFBA14945632","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Raju S","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Best one since the original","displayName":"Ashley","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-12T17:57:43.296Z","updateDate":"2019-08-12T17:57:43.296Z","user":{"userId":"cc43fb1f-7de1-4320-8292-1dd8429848e0","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Ashley","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 12, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great finish to an amazing chapter of movies over the span of 25 years.","displayName":"Brendon P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-12T17:02:59.864Z","updateDate":"2019-08-12T17:02:59.864Z","user":{"userId":"7fc75e38-7408-4d0e-b6f2-178bb1431d1e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Brendon P","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 12, 2019"}]}
