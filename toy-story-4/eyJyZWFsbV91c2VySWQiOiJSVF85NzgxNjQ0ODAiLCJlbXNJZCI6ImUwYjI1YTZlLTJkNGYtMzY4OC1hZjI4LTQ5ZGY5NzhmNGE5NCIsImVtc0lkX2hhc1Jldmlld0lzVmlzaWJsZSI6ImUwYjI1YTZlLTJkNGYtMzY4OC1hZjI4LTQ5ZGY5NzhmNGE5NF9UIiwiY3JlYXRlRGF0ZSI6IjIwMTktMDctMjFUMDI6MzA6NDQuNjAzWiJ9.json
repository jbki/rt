Only because my own child has grown up with this movie. He is 14 now. Tears because it's coming to an end. Cried more when the characters were about to die heading down the  firey trash chute. Poorly written at the end. Like it was rushed. Highly disappointed as a parent who's child idolized Buzz and Woody. Would have preferred to see the relationships between the original characters.
