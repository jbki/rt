First of all, I think Woody and Bo Peep's relationship started VERY late. The end of the movie, are you serious??? And to go on with that, it wasn't clear they were leaving together immediately until all the other toys left. Now, the real part is the amount of times they hugged. Like, I get that it's rated G and all, but why would you put us through the pain of watching them embrace instead of actually letting them kiss. If I'm being honest, I was disappointed with the extent that Disney/Pixar took the relationship too. Some may argue that this is because of the movie rating, but I know PLENTY of kindergartners, who had the first kiss. And I'm not talking about with their mom, I'm talking about with their Uncle ;). I'm just kidding, but for real, one small smooch from Bo on Woody's cheek couldn't of hurt, right? The second to last thing I have to say is about Forky and \"Knifia??\" (bear with me)'s relationship. It started at the VERY VERY end of movie. And I know, maybe you don't want to see two utensils making out, but seriously, the depth of the relationship was not thought about enough. And my theory for this is probably because the animators and directors and story writers probably work so many hours at Pixar/Disney that they don't have the time for relationships. But watch some erotica, will ya? Finally, I'd like to complain about the RUNPEE app. It told me that there was an extra after waiting for the 6 minute credits. You know what that extra was? The Pixar Intro with Duke Caboom bouncing on the I in pixar and then one tiny character walking in. Then it ended. I really expected more from this app which had such high reviews. If you're going to talk about the after-credits, make it reliable and true. But I'm not going to write a review on the app store because I know how hard that developer works. Anyway, thanks for sticking to my rant.. and I hoped this helped if your hopes were to see some erotic action in the possible conclusion to this animated saga.\n\n -Master Reviewer","displayName":"Master R","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T23:11:26.538Z","updateDate":"2019-07-07T23:11:37.415Z","user":{"userId":"978145334","realm":"RT","displayName":"Master R","accountLink":"/user/id/978145334"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Fitting ending about letting go","displayName":"Michael","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T23:06:37.435Z","updateDate":"2019-07-09T22:04:29.620Z","user":{"userId":"316876B0-6658-4FE5-BC6C-38E7640DE478","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michael","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Family thought the movie was hilarious, but really did not like the ending.","displayName":"David F","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T23:04:31.589Z","updateDate":"2019-07-07T23:04:31.589Z","user":{"userId":"1d2c2db3-4dc0-4636-905f-70455430f381","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"David F","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Wasnâ€™t expecting it to be so good!","displayName":"Estambe","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T23:04:07.548Z","updateDate":"2019-07-07T23:04:07.548Z","user":{"userId":"B5C41FDD-13CD-4EC0-98FD-3439231B2350","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Estambe","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Always such a great story....definitely miss knowing there won't be anymore.","displayName":"sjalex","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T22:48:25.287Z","updateDate":"2019-07-07T22:48:25.287Z","user":{"userId":"08a2ebd0-1875-4b5c-b800-37f754c31506","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"sjalex","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"}]}
