The way everything looks smooth and shiny is also kind of a turn off, they keep changing the look of it all slightly with every movie. This forky character is retarded and annoying. I love how Keegan and Jordan are in the movie. They were probably the best addition to the Toy Story world. The cameos in this movie are great. \n\nI really liked the ending. I'm glad they went in that direction. I guess they're going to make another one. It's kind of sad to see that this Toy Story movie doesn't really live up to it's predecessors but I do have to give it up for continuing the legacy. To me, this one seems like the weakest of all of them which is sad to say but, oh well. Good movie nonetheless. Key & Peele and Keanu Reeves were the highlight of this movie.","displayName":"Andy S","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":true,"createDate":"2019-10-29T00:45:45.116Z","updateDate":"2019-10-29T00:45:45.116Z","user":{"userId":"976200057","realm":"RT","displayName":"Andy S","accountLink":"/user/id/976200057"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 29, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"This movie was crafted exceptionally well, we join our old friends Woody, Buzz, Bo Peep, and all the others... Including Mr Potato Head, still voiced by Don Rickles, two years after his death. 25 years after the original films release, this film still has the ability to captivate audiences of all ages. We find our selves, once again following woody on an adventure, that spirals in to a chaotic turn of events. As we have come to expect from the franchise. The script is very well written with a lot of first time comedic value. Especially the dialogue between Woody, and his newly found friend Forky. A talking spork. You can also expect some moments of great sadness, as this seems to be the last time all of our friends will be together. With all that said this movie will stand the test of time, and is definitely worth a watch, or 2, or 3, or 4.\n","displayName":"Lou L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-28T15:16:26.289Z","updateDate":"2019-10-28T15:16:26.289Z","user":{"userId":"978201199","realm":"RT","displayName":"Lou L","accountLink":"/user/id/978201199"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Still got a friend  in me .","displayName":"Leon C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1292430441/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-10-28T01:40:41.342Z","updateDate":"2019-10-28T01:40:41.342Z","user":{"userId":"851009662","realm":"RT","displayName":"Leon C","accountLink":"/user/id/851009662"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Oct 28, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3_5","review":"Good movie but three had a better ending.
