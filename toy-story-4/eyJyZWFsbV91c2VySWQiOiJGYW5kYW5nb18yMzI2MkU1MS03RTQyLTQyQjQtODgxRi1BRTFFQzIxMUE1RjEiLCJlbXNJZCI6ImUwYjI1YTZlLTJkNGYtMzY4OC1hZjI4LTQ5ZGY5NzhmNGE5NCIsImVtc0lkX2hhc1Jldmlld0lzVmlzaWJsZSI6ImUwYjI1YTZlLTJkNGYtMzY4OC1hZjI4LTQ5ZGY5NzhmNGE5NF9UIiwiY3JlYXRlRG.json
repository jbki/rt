Woody worked hard over the past 3 movies bringing toys together under the idea that a toy needs to be there for its children. Woody abandons all of this, and his friends to be a lost toy which not only doesnt work innthe movie, it goes against everything woody has stood for. The other toys are just oknwith him abandoning hom to it just didnt work. The new characters ranged from boring to uninteresting.  Forky was not a good character he was the center of the story but wasnt worth the time. The only humorous toy this time was duke kaboom but his antics will look familiar because youve seen them before. Hes a direct rip off of the fun from the lego movies. None of this story should have happened.  It was terrible.  The movie lacked humor, fun, its missing a good story and new characters you can be drawn too. All in all they change everything about what woody stood for and throw away the driving principle of the past 3 movies. They should have thrown this script in the trash with forky and left them their it sucked.","displayName":"Jonathon L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-13T21:50:38.480Z","updateDate":"2019-07-13T21:50:57.492Z","user":{"userId":"975303286","realm":"RT","displayName":"Jonathon L","accountLink":"/user/id/975303286"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was very interesting and a good fit with the other toy story movies.","displayName":"Paul White","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-13T21:41:51.531Z","updateDate":"2019-07-13T21:41:51.531Z","user":{"userId":"F4AF5E91-C9A4-49CC-8031-3A00DC3FAF40","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Paul White","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 13, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2","review":"The movie doesnt have to exist and is a complete waist of time.
