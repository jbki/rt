The ONLY draw back for me was Forky. Not only was he an annoying character but he seemed like an afterthought and a weak plot point to drive the movie forward.

It all seems...believable!  The animation is awesome as always.  The scariest part (to me, and I am 60 years old!!) was when Gabby Gabby was explaining to Woody that she was \"born\" without a voicebox...I thought she was pretending to be sincere but was going to attack him and rip it out!!  There were some scenes that were snifflers, like when the shopkeeper's granddaughter tossed Gabby back into the box, and like when the little girl was lost at the carnival.
