This movie is a little overated, with this i Â´m not saying that the movie is bad, i just say that toy story 4 has a 97/100 in rotten tomatoes, or has a 8.2/10 in imdb, the movie is good yeah but it's not good enough to have those qualifications, let's be,honest of the 4 movies this is the worst, the only that stands out from its predecessors is in the incredible animation, something thati like very much is that the movie takes risk and lets Woody leave once it have finished his purpose, and his ending is good, great ending, I hope that this one be the last movie, in conclusion toy story 4 is a good movie with a mature plot,but nothing outstanding.","displayName":"Diego P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-07T06:50:41.409Z","updateDate":"2019-08-07T06:54:03.253Z","user":{"userId":"978187911","realm":"RT","displayName":"Diego P","accountLink":"/user/id/978187911"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Pixar always delivers. Yes its a 4th part to a great movie which by now fans usually will get tired of seeing a new part that is lackluster or made just for profit but this final installment was as good as the first or even better. You will fall in love with some of the new characters. There are moments that make you emotional and some surprises. Definitely another worth seeing in the theater and buying at home.

However, they did an amazing job. The story was something new, and an interesting concept. However, they did not give a lot of the other characters like Buzz and Jessie a lot of screentime but made up for it with all of its new characters. The villain, Gabby Gabby was very cool. I also loved Jordan Peele and Keegan Michael-Key's characters, Bunny and Ducky, I also think they did a great job. Keanu Reeves was also an amazing addition to the franchise. However, I do believe that the original Toy Story is better, but this is definitely my second favorite one, it was a close call.
