Took the grandkids.  They had seen it once, but enjoyed it a second time.  Loved the superior animation, the story, the sweet ending.  It was perhaps just a little lengthy and could have been cut a little here and there.  Overall, a wonderful, funny family adventure.","displayName":"Nancy J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-09T01:33:52.471Z","updateDate":"2019-08-09T01:33:52.471Z","user":{"userId":"de0594ae-c4e0-42f1-bc24-c8b2b462702e","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Nancy J","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I'm so happy they are continuing the Toy Story series. I went in the theatre not knowing what the storyline was going to be about and was taken along for the ride. This movie talks about making new friends, rekindling with old friends, and moving on from what we know to beginning a new journey of life. It also talks about the troubles of not being accepted by society when you don't meet the expectations - ie a working voicebox. Great movie and I'm really excited to see what else is in store on woody's journey.
