Movie was well-written, genuinely funny and at the same time poignant. The writers avoided some of the clich pitfalls inherent in this type of movie. The new characters, especially the two \"prizes\" from the arcade added a lot to an expertly-composed, flowing script. And then, of course, there was Keanu Reeves. As a huge John Wick fan, I was greatly impressed by the casting and execution of the character of Duke Kaboom.","displayName":"Elwood L","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-08-02T17:46:20.615Z","updateDate":"2019-08-02T17:46:20.615Z","user":{"userId":"8547f52c-f607-4bac-93c7-cbc358431759","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Elwood L","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Aug 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Even though I hadn’t seen the previous Toy Story movies this did not take away the entertainment of this movie.
