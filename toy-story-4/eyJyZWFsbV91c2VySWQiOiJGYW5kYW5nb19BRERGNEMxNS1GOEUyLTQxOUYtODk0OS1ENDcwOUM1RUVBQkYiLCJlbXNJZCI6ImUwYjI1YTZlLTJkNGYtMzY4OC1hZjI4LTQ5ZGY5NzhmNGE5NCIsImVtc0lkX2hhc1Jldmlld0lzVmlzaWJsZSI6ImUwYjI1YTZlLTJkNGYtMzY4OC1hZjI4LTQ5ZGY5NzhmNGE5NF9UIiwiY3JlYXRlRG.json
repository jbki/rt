Gaby Gaby is a good character with a very interesting bow, but with a common ending, \"Garfinho\" brings a new symbolism to the franchise and works well, even having a more comical function and serving as the script key.\n\nToy Story has always been remembered for having a spectacular animation, this is its first, and in its fourth version, clearly a new level is achieved, the film has a spectacular animation with light and shadow games, no mechanization, fluid movements and real, in terms of animation and direction, Toy Story 4 is spectacular.\n\nToy Srory 4 has few artifices for the children's audience, one or another joke and the visual issue, the rest is a film that little children will have fun with a load and more adult concept, the film has a message on maturation, attachment, love and of course, friendship. Toy Story 4 only stands above its predecessors in terms of animation, however, it still continues a good movie.","displayName":"ANDERSON G","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-10T01:45:32.564Z","updateDate":"2019-07-10T01:45:32.564Z","user":{"userId":"974807001","realm":"RT","displayName":"ANDERSON G","accountLink":"/user/id/974807001"},"score":3.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 10, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"I am trash.
