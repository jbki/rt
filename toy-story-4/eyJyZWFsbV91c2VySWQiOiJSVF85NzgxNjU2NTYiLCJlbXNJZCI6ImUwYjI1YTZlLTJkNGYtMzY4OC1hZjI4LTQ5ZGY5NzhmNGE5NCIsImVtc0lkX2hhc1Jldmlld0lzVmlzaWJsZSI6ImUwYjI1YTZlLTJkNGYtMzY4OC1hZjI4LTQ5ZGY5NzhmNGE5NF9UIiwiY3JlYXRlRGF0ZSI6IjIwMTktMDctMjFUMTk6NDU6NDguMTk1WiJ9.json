The animation was incredible, the story line was great, and the ending was perfect. I gave 4 stars because it was a little scarier than it needed to be- I understand that Pixar wants to appeal to audiences of all ages, but my almost 7 year old was really scared and wanted to leave the theater at times.

Every toy story introduced us to a new TOY, but nope not this one we got a fork. I kind of got over the fact that her new best thing in the whole world was a fork, but then at the end when she came back from her first day of first grade she brought home a knife. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I was confused.

As someone whose first ever film was the original story and someone who saw Toy Story 3 in cinemas just before I started university (watching Andy head off for college), I consider myself very much of the Toy Story generation. This film really feels like it's forgotten it's older fans and has moved on to a much younger audience, which is quite sad. It lacked the usual charm of a Pixar movie that sees jokes for both children and adults. Scenes are repetitive and cover a lot of the same information multiple times. \n\nThe toy cast list has almost been tripled and yet next to no time is spent with any character that isn't Woody or Bo. Even staple characters like Buzz and Jessie are very much sidelined. So many characters are introduced and given next to no screen time.\n\nIt's sad to see Toy Story end this way after, what I consider, a perfect ending to their third instalment.","displayName":"Helen N","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/10208735248593158/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-21T17:31:38.313Z","updateDate":"2019-07-21T17:35:48.394Z","user":{"userId":"975619419","realm":"RT","displayName":"Helen N","accountLink":"/user/id/975619419"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 21, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_2_5","review":"I love antique stores so the fact that one played such a prominent role was my favorite part.
