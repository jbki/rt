I know most people would've love to cap it off at the third Toy Story Movie and mark it as the definitive ending to a great franchize. Although the addition of this movie is somewhat questionable and is garnering a lot of controversies, it's still a great instalment; with the same heart, emotion and dedication put into it like the last three films. Toy Story 4 does not quite live up to its predecessors, but it is an awesome and emotional experience that left me in tears. I enjoyed it a lot and I highly recommend watching it!","displayName":"Cy P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T07:33:47.567Z","updateDate":"2019-07-07T07:47:48.864Z","user":{"userId":"978144325","realm":"RT","displayName":"Cy P","accountLink":"/user/id/978144325"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie.
