However, in typical Disney fashion, the story takes some very interesting turns that reveals a lot of heart and ends with arguably one of cinema's all time best romances. The antique shop scenes were scary enough to spin a true horror sequel.","displayName":"Alan W","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-09T03:54:42.166Z","updateDate":"2019-07-09T03:54:42.166Z","user":{"userId":"914289202","realm":"RT","displayName":"Alan W","accountLink":"/user/id/914289202"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Such a cute movie absolutely loved it","displayName":"Michele  B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-09T03:49:56.293Z","updateDate":"2019-07-09T03:49:56.293Z","user":{"userId":"30af0673-978d-4600-b824-dcecd0b451f4","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Michele  B","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4","review":"Concept of the story remains, but the plot changes.

The plot was just stupid in comparison. Characters made their own choices leading to more obstacles to overcome. Saving a spork is a stupid reason to do that. The spork wanting to go in the trash was dumb too. Did like Woody's choice to help his enemy and make other kids happy, but that's about it.","displayName":"dad of 3","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-09T03:45:22.049Z","updateDate":"2019-07-09T03:45:22.049Z","user":{"userId":"1e8818f3-203d-4005-8dd3-d663385e39cd","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"dad of 3","accountLink":null},"score":2,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 09, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Of course it was a fun movie. Of course the animation was gorgeous. But was it necessary? Toy Story 4 brings the light hearted imagination of our childhood onto the screen, but it seemed to me that Toy Story 3 was the perfect ending to a wonderful trilogy, why prolong the story and [spoilers ahead!] make Woody a \"lost toy\" cowboy? It felt extremely out of character, instead of something to be worked towards for the whole series of movies, it felt like an impromptu decision made by Woody. Overall a fun watch, but it is more of an under developed alternate ending to the Toy Story than an amazing addition.
