Avoiding spoilers make it difficult to describe, but having characters that behave appallingly \"win\" because they're somewhat sympathetic is not the message I want to send to youngsters that might watch this movie. There are ways that this could have played out but if the message they're trying to send is \"Yeah, sometimes the bad guys win\" then mission accomplished.","displayName":"Caracticus T","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-02T17:39:19.836Z","updateDate":"2019-11-02T17:39:28.641Z","user":{"userId":"921822743","realm":"RT","displayName":"Caracticus T","accountLink":"/user/id/921822743"},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_1","review":"The movie destroys the character of Woody by demoizing his biggest strength, loyalty, and suddenly makes Buzz into a complete idiot. The plot feels very contrived and is at some points fairly frightening for children. It has no where near the wit, charm, or childhood appeal that the first 3 Toy Stories have. In the end Woody ditches his friends for Bo-peep. Bo-peep is beautifully animated but is a very boring character.","displayName":"Pure H","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-11-02T16:50:42.789Z","updateDate":"2019-11-02T16:50:51.710Z","user":{"userId":"978368576","realm":"RT","displayName":"Pure H","accountLink":"/user/id/978368576"},"score":1,"timeFromCreation":"Nov 02, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_0_5","review":"Horror movie, very scary and not appropriate for children of any age.
