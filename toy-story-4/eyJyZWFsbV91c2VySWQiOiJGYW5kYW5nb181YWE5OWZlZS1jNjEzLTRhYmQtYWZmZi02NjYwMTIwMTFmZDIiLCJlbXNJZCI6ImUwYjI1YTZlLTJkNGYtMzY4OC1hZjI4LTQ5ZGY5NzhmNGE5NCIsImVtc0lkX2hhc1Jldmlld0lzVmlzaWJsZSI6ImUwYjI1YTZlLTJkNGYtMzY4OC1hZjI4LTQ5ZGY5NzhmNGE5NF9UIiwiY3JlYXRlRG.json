But to have to watch the biggest, best blockbuster of the summer, Toy Story 4, is just the most wonderful thing, especially when watched twice in two weeks of June. To simply put it, Toy Story 4 has all the most wonderful equivalents of Cars 3. One reason is because it teaches about friendship and inclusion and how to love each toy the way he (and she) is. And two, among the three \"Toy Stories\" I've watched in the past, this one this year is the most superb, because it is reminiscent of all of them. Makes me want to relive the day I received my first toy as a little kid years ago. The lesson: sometimes it's great to remember all of the good times you had as a kid being in elementary school, other times we look forward to the present (and future). To infinity and beyond! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)","displayName":"Aaron G","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1488054964579402/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-08T11:06:56.020Z","updateDate":"2019-07-08T11:11:49.327Z","user":{"userId":"976256175","realm":"RT","displayName":"Aaron G","accountLink":"/user/id/976256175"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"I went into this not having seen 3 and not really having a desire to see 4, it was a date day and her choice.

It's simply beautiful and must not be missed. I can't think of a better conclusion to Woody's story arc, which is deeply moving. It's funny yet scary, childlike yet philosophical, light yet deep -- all at the same time. You can't help but emphathize with the existential crisis of a toy - one day beloved, next day trash and start questioning your purpose of life! Brilliantly told and executed, thanks also to having a great cast of voice actors, including Tom Hanks. Seriously, WOW! Please, Disney. Start working on Toy Story 5. And make sure it's the same scriptwriters. Love them to bits.","displayName":"Chrisanne C","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/689922477/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":true,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-08T10:11:26.520Z","updateDate":"2019-07-08T10:11:26.520Z","user":{"userId":"909989370","realm":"RT","displayName":"Chrisanne C","accountLink":"/user/id/909989370"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 08, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"My 2 daughters were glued to the screen the entire movie & loved it.
