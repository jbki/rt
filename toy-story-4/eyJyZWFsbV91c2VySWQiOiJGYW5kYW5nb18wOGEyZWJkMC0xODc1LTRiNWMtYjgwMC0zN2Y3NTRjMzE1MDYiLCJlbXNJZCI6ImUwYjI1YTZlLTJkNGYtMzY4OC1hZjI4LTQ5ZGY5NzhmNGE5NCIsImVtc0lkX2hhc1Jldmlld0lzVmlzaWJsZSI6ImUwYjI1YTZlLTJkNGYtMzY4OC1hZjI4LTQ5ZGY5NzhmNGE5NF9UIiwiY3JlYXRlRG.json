Unbelievably creative twist with the intro of Fork-y.  It creates a similar relationship that Woody had with Buzz who thought he was a real Space Ranger, BUT with a twist regarding Fork-y's sense of self awareness and purpose.  Same with the villain too, seemed like any of the previous Toy Story villains but with a new twist.  Something to think about, this movie features the least of the original core characters, it's like part 3 was THEIR last adventure.  This movie is all about Woody finding Bo Peep and a new adventure.","displayName":"Commander Hurricane R9","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T22:00:27.422Z","updateDate":"2019-07-07T22:00:27.422Z","user":{"userId":"66688efc-0215-4642-a37c-8b5bb50a9c3d","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Commander Hurricane R9","accountLink":null},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"It was a great story line even for adults.","displayName":"Kelley","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-07T21:40:35.404Z","updateDate":"2019-07-07T21:40:35.404Z","user":{"userId":"DFA2E3EF-D7DA-497F-8CE6-3DB8E2E7123B","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Kelley","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 07, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Saw it in 3D and was very pleased.
