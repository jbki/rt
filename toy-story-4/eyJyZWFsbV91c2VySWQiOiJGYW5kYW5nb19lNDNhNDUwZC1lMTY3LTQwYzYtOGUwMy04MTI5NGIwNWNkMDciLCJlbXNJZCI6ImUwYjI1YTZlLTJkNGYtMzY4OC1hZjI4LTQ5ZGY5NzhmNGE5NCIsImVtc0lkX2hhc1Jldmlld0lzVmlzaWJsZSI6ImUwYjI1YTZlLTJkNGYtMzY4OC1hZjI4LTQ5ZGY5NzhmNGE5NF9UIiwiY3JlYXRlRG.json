Toy Story 3 wrapped the story lines up so well that it would seem there wasn’t a need for another sequel. However, I was still excited to see this one. The movie started off very promising as they did a recap of Woody and the gang as they transitioned from Andy to Bonnie. Moving forward to Bonnie’s first day at kindergarten where Woody was there for her was really touching. Then we started the story about Forky and things started going downhill. Forky as a toy character was cute and funny but the story fell off the tracks when Woody went on his quest to find Bo Peep. Bo Peep was a minor character in the Toy Story saga so to see this character take over the movie was disappointing. Suddenly Woody is almost useless and Buzz becomes a blithering idiot. This is totally out of character for Woody, Buzz, and Bo Peep. The rest of the gang we love so much was barely in the movie. Bullseye isn’t in it at all. The story would have been much better had Jessie been Woody’s partner in finding Forky and Bo Peep. However, Jessie was just an accessory in the background here. It was jolting to watch Woody become so useless when he had always been so clever and resourceful in the other films. Even more insulting was expecting the audience to accept a brain dead and cowardly Buzz Lightyear. Why did the writers do this? Finally, the ending was a real clunker. Woody would NEVER abandon his friends like he did here. He would NEVER give up on his “kid” even if he was no longer her favorite toy. It all just felt so wrong. I kept waiting for the tears to well up but this ending was not emotional at all. So was the movie really awful? No, it wasn’t. Did it at least live up to the other three films in the series? Not even remotely! Despite trying my very best to love this film it just didn’t work for me. What a shame.
