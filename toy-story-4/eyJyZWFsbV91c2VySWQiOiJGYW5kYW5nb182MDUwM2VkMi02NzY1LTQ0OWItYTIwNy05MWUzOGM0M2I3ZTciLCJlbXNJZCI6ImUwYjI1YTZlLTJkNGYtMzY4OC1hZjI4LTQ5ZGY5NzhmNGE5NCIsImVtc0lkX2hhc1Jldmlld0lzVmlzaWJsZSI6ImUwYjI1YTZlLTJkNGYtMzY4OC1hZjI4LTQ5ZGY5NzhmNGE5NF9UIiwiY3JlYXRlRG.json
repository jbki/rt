It is absolutely outrageous how far we have come with technology. Now having the ability to make an animated film so realistic. The story of the film had a beautiful plot, great twists and gives every age something to laugh about.

Its design and graphic animation is superb and stuns the other movies. Character development is great and the villain is one of the best structured villains i've seen to date. But Buzz is completely played of and shoe horned to the side quite abruptly and dumbed down for comic relief. It also hangs shy from a 5 star not only because of that but because it really does play with the 'is this necessary?' emotions of a sequel. It's a good add on yes. But i do venture to the side of it should ending with the beautiful Andy Saga ending. Great movie.\n","displayName":"Rhys B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-22T01:02:11.286Z","updateDate":"2019-07-22T01:02:11.286Z","user":{"userId":"978166160","realm":"RT","displayName":"Rhys B","accountLink":"/user/id/978166160"},"score":4,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_3","review":"Not a fan of  the Toy Story franchise. took one of my grands, he liked it! lol!","displayName":"Belinda T B","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-22T00:42:18.300Z","updateDate":"2019-07-22T00:42:18.300Z","user":{"userId":"584c9dd8-297e-40e7-aad3-7489e4ff8833","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"Belinda T B","accountLink":null},"score":3,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_4_5","review":"Movie was great, no one at ticket area to help folks who had questions, had to wait in conssession line.","displayName":"TM in ct","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-22T00:30:47.201Z","updateDate":"2019-07-22T00:30:47.838Z","user":{"userId":"4c8b2404-ad00-4578-aa89-e37a0f3200bc","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"TM in ct","accountLink":null},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 22, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Great movie.
