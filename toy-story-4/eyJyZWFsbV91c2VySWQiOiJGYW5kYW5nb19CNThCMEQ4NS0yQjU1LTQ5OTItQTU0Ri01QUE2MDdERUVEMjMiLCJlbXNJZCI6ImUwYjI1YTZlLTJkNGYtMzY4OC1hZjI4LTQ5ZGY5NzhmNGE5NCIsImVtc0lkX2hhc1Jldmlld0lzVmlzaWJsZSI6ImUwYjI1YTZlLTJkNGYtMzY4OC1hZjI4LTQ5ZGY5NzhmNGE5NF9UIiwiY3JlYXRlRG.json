Like all Toy Story movies , it re - emphasizes Woody need to be needed but places him as a father figure who indirectly created Forky , and having a rekindled experienced with Bo Peep which acts as his guide throughout . Add in how there is no blatant antagonist brings the progression towards modern society where things are on a spectrum and towards Woody existential crisis with the perfect end towards the franchise . Also with the other characters and their stories make for many interesting encounters along the way .
