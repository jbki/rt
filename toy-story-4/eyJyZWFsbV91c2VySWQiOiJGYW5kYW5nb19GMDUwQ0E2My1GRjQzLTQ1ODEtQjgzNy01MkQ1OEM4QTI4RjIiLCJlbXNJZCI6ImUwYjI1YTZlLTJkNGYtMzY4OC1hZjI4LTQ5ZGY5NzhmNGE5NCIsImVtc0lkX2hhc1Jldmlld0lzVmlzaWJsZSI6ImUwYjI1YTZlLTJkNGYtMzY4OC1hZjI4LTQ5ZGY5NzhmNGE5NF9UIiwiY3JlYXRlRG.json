Way to go Disney. This could have been a bunch of animated shorts to extend the story and not messed up the original ending but no, they went ahead and make this steaming pile. Don't even get me started on 'Forky'. How many little kids do you know are having an existential crisis? They could have had Gabby take over for Bo Peep so she could be with Woody and the others again but no, Bonnie suddenly gets bored with Woody and is more attached to Forky, who should have fallen to pieces after his first day. I will say that I wish Gabby was the antagonist in the last film because she has a much better motive than Lotso. This film was basically just made to justify making Pixar Pier mostly toy story themed so it stays relevant and more toys can be added. I guess they're tired of making terrible live-action remakes and are trying to tank their animation department too.","displayName":"Stephanie L","displayImageUrl":"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100006203020259/picture","isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-20T07:03:56.569Z","updateDate":"2019-07-20T07:03:56.569Z","user":{"userId":"958781812","realm":"RT","displayName":"Stephanie L","accountLink":"/user/id/958781812"},"score":0.5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"ready for toystory 5","displayName":"fan","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":true,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-20T06:39:10.696Z","updateDate":"2019-07-20T06:39:10.696Z","user":{"userId":"5A6B610D-F1C0-4FC0-986F-7C2316303598","realm":"Fandango","displayName":"fan","accountLink":null},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 20, 2019"},{"rating":"STAR_5","review":"Toy Story 4 truly hits home as the fourth addition to the series. It certainly does not lack in good humor, and the evolution of Woody's life as a toy really shines. His undying loyalty and sacrifice for the good of whatever kid owns him is a heartwarming spectacle on screen. The new characters are interesting and full of life. They all feel like they fit perfectly into the plot of the movie and are not just an excuse to sell more toys to kids. Keanu Reeves' steals the show with his character, Duke Caboom. Each line he delivers is gold and guarantees a solid laugh from the audience. If you're looking for a masterpiece with heart-tugging emotion, quality jokes, and a different take on the world of these toys, this film is for you.","displayName":"Konrad P","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-07-20T05:32:18.851Z","updateDate":"2019-07-20T05:59:10.210Z","user":{"userId":"978162965","realm":"RT","displayName":"Konrad P","accountLink":"/user/id/978162965"},"score":5,"timeFromCreation":"Jul 20, 2019"}]}
