Heart, drama, beauty and fun. It's an excellent heartfelt adventure with brilliant vocal performances and a lovely moral code. Pixar really confirm their place as the best animation studio in the business.\nThe only areas in which this movie suffers is that sometimes it's hard to forget how unnecessary it was considering the perfect ending of Toy Story 3.\nHowever, that is a minor issue. This film is excellent and is definitely the best family movie of the year so far. If you haven't seen it already, be sure to check it out.","displayName":"Insta.

For a cartoon it has so much emotion in it . Very funny with a meaningful and well constructed story.  Sadly it appears to be the final chapter to the \"Toy Story\" line. Unbelievably great movies! I was a bit dissapointed the original main characters play a minimal role in the plot along with minimal screen time as well. Buzz Lightyear is practically a minor character since his role lacks significance  to the plot tremendously if you compare it to the previous \"toy story's\" and they also make his personality appear dimwitted pretty often which just simply looks not right if you've watched 1 ,2 and 3. Even less importance are Jessie, Bullseye, Slinky,Potato Heads, Rex etc .. shaved a half star for that. Still excellent but it ranks the lowest in the saga to me.  I understand if you don't like the bittersweet ending. Some say the 3rd is how it should have ended which ends on a more positive note. Still i give it 9/10.","displayName":"Landon J","displayImageUrl":null,"isVerified":false,"isSuperReviewer":false,"hasSpoilers":false,"hasProfanity":false,"createDate":"2019-12-14T01:38:12.115Z","updateDate":"2019-12-14T05:03:05.224Z","user":{"userId":"977599810","realm":"RT","displayName":"Landon J","accountLink":"/user/id/977599810"},"score":4.5,"timeFromCreation":"Dec 14, 2019"}]}
